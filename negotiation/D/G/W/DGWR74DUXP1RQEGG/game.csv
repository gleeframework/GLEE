"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $95. It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to agree on a price.  $110 is still too high for me. If you're willing to drop to $98, I'll take it.",98.0,Bob,6,
