Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives you room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This makes it more likely Bob will consider the offer.
* **It's a strong opening:** This shows you are confident in the value of the product. 

Let me know if you'd like me to adjust this based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your minimum of $12,000.  By rejecting, you can make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate further. $10,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

Here's why I chose this:

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** We want to bridge the gap between your minimum and Bob's offer. A counteroffer of $11,000 keeps the negotiation moving.
* **Reasoning:** The message highlights the value of the product while also demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Flexibility:**  This counteroffer allows for further negotiation if Bob still wants to bargain.

Let me know if Bob accepts, rejects, or makes a counteroffer!"
