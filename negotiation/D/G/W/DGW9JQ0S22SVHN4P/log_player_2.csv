Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! We're excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, we're willing to offer you the product for $1300000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,100,000. This aligns better with my budget and the product's overall market value. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but we still need to ensure we're fairly compensated for the product's value. After re-evaluating the market, we're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1200000. We believe this is a reasonable compromise that balances our needs and your budget.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is right at the limit of what Bob is willing to pay and still save money. It's a good deal compared to John's $1,500,000 offer. Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price, saving Bob $300,000."
