"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $150 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm hoping to get a better price.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $175? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $175 is still a bit too high.  Let's split the difference and go with $162.50.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $162.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $162.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $162.50 is close to my desired price and it's likely he won't go higher. Accepting this offer ensures I get a good price for the product and saves time in further negotiation."
