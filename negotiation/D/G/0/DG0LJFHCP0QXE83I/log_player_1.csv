Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,175,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,150,000, which would be $1,125,000. I think this is a fair price for the product.

While it's tempting to try and get a bit more, Bob has consistently moved his price upwards, and we're getting close to the point where further haggling might irritate him and make him less willing to negotiate. Taking the $1,125,000 ensures a very profitable deal without risking the deal falling through."
