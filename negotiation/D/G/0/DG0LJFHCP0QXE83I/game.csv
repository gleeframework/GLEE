"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the product's value is truly significant, and $1,100,000 undervalues its potential. How about we meet halfway at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your understanding, but I still think $1,100,000 is a fair price for the product. However, I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While I value meeting your needs, I believe the product's potential warrants a slightly higher price. Would you consider $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,175,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,150,000, which would be $1,125,000. I think this is a fair price for the product.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
