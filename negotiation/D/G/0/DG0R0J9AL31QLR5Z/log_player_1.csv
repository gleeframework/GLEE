Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to your business.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, it's always best to aim higher initially. Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts. He gets a $150,000 discount from my asking price, and I make a $150,000 profit over John's offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to make a decision quickly."
