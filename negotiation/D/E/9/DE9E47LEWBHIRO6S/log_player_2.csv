"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum price.**  There's no immediate advantage to accepting.
* **You want to see if you can get a better price.** Rejecting allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price. 
* **John is always an option.**  If the negotiation fails, you have a guaranteed alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:**  A counteroffer significantly lower than the initial price shows you're serious about negotiating.
* **Reasonable price:**  $125 is still a good price for you, leaving room for compromise.
* **Keeps the door open:** The message emphasizes interest while leaving room for Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit high, but I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $137.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable price:** $137.50 is within your acceptable range and a good deal considering your starting point.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While you could potentially get a lower price, there's a risk Alice might become less willing to negotiate further or you might run out of rounds before reaching a deal."
