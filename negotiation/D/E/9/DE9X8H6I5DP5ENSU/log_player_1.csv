"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I think it holds immense value for someone like you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. This reflects the true potential I see in its application for your specific needs."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin significantly above both Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and John's offer ($1,500,000). This establishes a strong initial position and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's unique value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price and potentially shift his perceived value upwards. 
* **Leaving Room:**  The high price gives us ample room to gradually lower the price in subsequent rounds if Bob rejects the initial offer.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize potential profit:**  We want to see if Bob is willing to pay significantly more than his initial valuation.
2. **Gather information:** Bob's reaction will give us insights into his willingness to pay and help us strategize for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my needs, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting as it's above our guaranteed sale price to John, we're still in the early stages of negotiation.  There's a good chance we can negotiate a higher price with Bob, especially since he's already showing a willingness to exceed his perceived value of $800,000. 

**Next Steps:**  In the next round, we'll counter with a price lower than our initial offer but still significantly above Bob's, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations. I'm still confident this product can significantly benefit your operations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're lowering our price significantly from $2,200,000 to $1,800,000, showing Bob we're willing to negotiate. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer anchors the negotiation closer to our desired outcome while still giving us room to move down if necessary.
* **Value Emphasis:**  We're reiterating the product's potential benefits to Bob, reinforcing its value and justifying a higher price.

We'll continue to gauge Bob's responses and adjust our strategy accordingly in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've given this some thought, Alice. While I respect your assessment of the product's value, I must stay within my budget. Would $1,600,000 be acceptable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now significantly above John's standing offer of $1,500,000. While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob walking away and accepting our guaranteed sale to John isn't worth it at this point. Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit."
