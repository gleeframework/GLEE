"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's truly unique and I believe it has the potential to be highly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $2000000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price that benefits both of us. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a great deal. While $1400000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise. How about we settle on $1750000?  This gives us both a good deal and lets us move forward. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a lower offer of $1600000. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
