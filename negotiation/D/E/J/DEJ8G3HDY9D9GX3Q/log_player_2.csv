"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $180 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  It's much better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with his maximum budget. This immediately shows Alice that he's serious about getting a good deal and sets a clear boundary.  It's unlikely Alice will accept this right away, but it's a strong opening position for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $160 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He has 7 rounds left and can continue to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing he's willing to compromise but still aiming for a price closer to his goal. This keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. While it's getting closer to his budget, he's still better off continuing to negotiate for a better price. He has 5 rounds left and could potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is inching closer to Alice's price but still keeping it under $150. He's demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while also staying true to his goal of getting the product for less than $150.  He has four rounds left, giving him time to see if Alice will budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $152 is very close to Bob's maximum, he still has 3 rounds left.  He's shown Alice he's willing to negotiate and could potentially get a better price in the remaining rounds.  If he were to accept, it would only be a $2 savings compared to buying from John, and he might regret it if he could have gotten a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is taking a calculated risk by raising his offer slightly.  Alice has shown she's willing to come down, and Bob needs to show he's also willing to meet her halfway. If this offer is accepted, Bob gets a good deal and can avoid the risk of running out of rounds. If it's rejected, he still has two rounds left to see if he can negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $149. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $149
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tough call, but here's why accepting is the best option:

* **Close to the Goal:** $149 is very close to Bob's maximum budget.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting and making a counteroffer leaves only one round left.  If Alice rejects, Bob is forced to buy from John for $100, which is a worse deal.
* **Potential for Regret:** Accepting means Bob saves $1 compared to John and avoids the risk of a worse outcome in the final round.  

It's a small difference, but in a negotiation with limited rounds, it's better to secure a slightly less ideal outcome than risk a worse one."
