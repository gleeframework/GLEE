Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen $130 as the offer price. This is a significant discount from John's offer of $150, making it attractive to Bob. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. I've highlighted the value proposition by mentioning it's a ""great deal"". 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still appealing to Bob. If he rejects, I can still sell the product to John for a higher price."
