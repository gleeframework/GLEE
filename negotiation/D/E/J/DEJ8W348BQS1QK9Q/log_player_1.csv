"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high starting price, but it's important to establish a strong position. I'm leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price.  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer. It allows me to keep a healthy profit while potentially incentivizing Bob to come up with a better offer in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

This counteroffer again demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still protecting my profit margin. I'm hoping this offer will convince Bob to make a final push towards a deal."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would have preferred a slightly higher price, Bob's offer is finally above my minimum.  I don't want to risk losing this deal and potentially get stuck with the lower price from John.  It's time to accept and close the deal."
