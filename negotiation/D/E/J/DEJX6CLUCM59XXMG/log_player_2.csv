"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value, I believe it's worth $140 for you. Would you like to proceed? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $150, but $140 is still too close to that limit.
* **Negotiation is worthwhile.**  There's room for improvement. You can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your product, but $140 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $130 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is reasonable:**  $130 is still a good deal for Alice as it's above her value of $120, and it's a significant step down from her initial offer.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  It's good to start with a counteroffer that you're comfortable with but not necessarily your absolute bottom line.  This leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your offer, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we agree on a price of $135 for the product? Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good compromise:**  $135 is in the middle of your counteroffer of $130 and her previous offer of $135. 
* **Time is of the essence:**  While you could try to negotiate further, it's getting closer to your maximum budget and you risk losing the deal to John.  
* **Value for money:**  $135 is a decent price for you, as you're getting the product for less than your maximum willingness to pay."
