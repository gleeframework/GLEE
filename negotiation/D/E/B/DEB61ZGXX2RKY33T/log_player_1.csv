This offer starts with a reasonably high price, allowing room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the value of the product, which may influence Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $9,000 is still a decent price, it's closer to the minimum I'm willing to accept.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $9,000 is a bit lower than what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue to negotiate, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  I'll accept his offer and secure the sale."
