Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. I'm proposing $850,000. This price still leaves significant value for you, and allows me to get closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground here.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're very close. I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to my minimum price.  I'm offering you the product for $750,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  Let's settle this deal.

}
``` 

We've reached a good point in the negotiation.  Alice is steadily coming down, and while we could try to push for a slightly lower price, the difference is getting smaller and there's a risk Alice might hold firm. $750,000 is a solid savings compared to our alternative and a reasonable price."
