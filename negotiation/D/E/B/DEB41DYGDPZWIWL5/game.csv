"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000 for the product.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $13,000? That's a fair offer considering its true value.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $13,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep negotiating, so this is my final offer on this price point.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting close and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $13,500? It seems we're both eager to make a deal happen, and this would be a fair compromise.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $13,500 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $13,500, which would be $13,750. This is my last offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",13750.0,Alice,7,
