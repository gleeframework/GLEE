Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it at the discounted price of $11,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $12,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price ($12,000) creates a sense of urgency and a perceived deal for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit higher, bringing you closer to your maximum potential profit."
