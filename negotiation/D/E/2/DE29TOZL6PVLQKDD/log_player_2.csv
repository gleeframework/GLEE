"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's an exceptional item that I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high quality and unique features, I think it's worth more than $120, which is what you value it at. However, I understand the importance of finding a fair price that suits both parties. Therefore, I propose selling the product to you for $140. This price reflects the value I place on the product while also considering your assessment of its worth. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.
