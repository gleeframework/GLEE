"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire an item valued at $10,000 by you, while also getting a great deal compared to its market value. I believe this offer presents a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than the market value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, but unfortunately, $12,000 is a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
