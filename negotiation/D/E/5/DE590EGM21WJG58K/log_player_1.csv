Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering this product to you before listing it more broadly. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While you could start at $120, a slightly lower offer ($100) leaves room for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a backup plan with John, ensuring you won't be forced to go below $80. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
