"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Since Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy. This allows Bob to potentially secure a lower price without risking losing the opportunity entirely."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints. However, I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my costs. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, it's still above Bob's desired price.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving towards a price Bob is more comfortable with. There's likely still room to lower the price further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,150,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price to make this work for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.  This represents a significant step closer to your last offer, and I truly believe this product is worth investing in."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get as close to the price you want as possible, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to make a significant investment in this product. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to protect my investment. I can offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,125,000, which is very close to Bob's last offer of $1,100,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating,  the risk is that Alice might become less flexible and ultimately stick to her price.  Accepting the offer at $1,125,000 is a good compromise that secures the product for a price significantly lower than John's offer, and it also avoids the risk of further negotiation."
