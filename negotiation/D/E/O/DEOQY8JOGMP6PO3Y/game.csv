"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in this product.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $16000 for the product. This is a compromise that still brings value to both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
