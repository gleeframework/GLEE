"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1200000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. This represents a significant discount and allows you to acquire a valuable asset for a price below its true market value. Consider this a unique opportunity. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
