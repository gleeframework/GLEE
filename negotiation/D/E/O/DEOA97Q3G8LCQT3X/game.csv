"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $11,000. This offer reflects the value I place on the product while acknowledging your need to make a fair profit.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I've already made a significant concession. I'm willing to make one more move. I can do $12,500, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's the best I can do.",12500.0,Alice,5,
