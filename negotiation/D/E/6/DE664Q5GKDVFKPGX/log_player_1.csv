"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer allows me to see if Bob is seriously interested in the product and how much he's willing to pay. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  I'm prepared to negotiate down, but I want to see Bob's initial reaction and how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While $12,000 is better than my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for a better deal. 
* **Time to Counter:** I want to see if I can get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Approach:**  I'm aiming for a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's commitment to the product at a slightly higher price point.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  If Bob accepts this offer, I've secured a good price. If he rejects, I have more room to negotiate in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I believe I can get a better price with further negotiation.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to be strategic.  Selling to John right now is a viable option, but I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.
* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'll make another counteroffer to see if I can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Confidence:**  I'm again aiming for a middle ground, this time between my previous counteroffer and Bob's latest offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired price point.
* **Testing the Limits:** I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested in closing the deal, and if $12,500 is his ceiling.
* **Close to the Finish Line:** With only 5 rounds left, I'm getting closer to my minimum price point. If Bob rejects, I can consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds left, the window for negotiation is closing.
* **Limited Gain:** Bob's offer is only $1,000 above my minimum, and I'm not confident I can get a significantly higher offer in the remaining rounds.
* **Secure the Deal:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and ensures a quick and certain sale. It's a safe and practical decision given the limited time."
