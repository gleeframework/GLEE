Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'd be willing to offer $650,000 to start the negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

Round 3

Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000

We're still significantly below John's offer. It's time to push Bob closer to our acceptable range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $725,000 is still a long way from what I can accept. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $850,000? This offer stands as a testament to my willingness to find a compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $787,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $787,500

Bob is unlikely to move significantly closer to $800,000.  Selling to John guarantees the best outcome at this point.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob."
