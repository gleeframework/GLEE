"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'd be willing to offer $650,000 to start the negotiation.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, I'm working with a tighter budget on this purchase. Could we agree on $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $725,000 is still a long way from what I can accept. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $850,000? This offer stands as a testament to my willingness to find a compromise.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $787,500?",787500.0,Bob,6,
