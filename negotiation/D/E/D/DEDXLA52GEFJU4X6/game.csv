"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value far exceeds the asking price, and I believe it has the potential to significantly benefit you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
