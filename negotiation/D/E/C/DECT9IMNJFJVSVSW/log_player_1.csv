Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price if I keep negotiating."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,500 is a good offer, I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $8,500? It's still a great deal for a product you know is worth $8,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate down to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

This is a good deal for me. Bob is offering my minimum price and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
