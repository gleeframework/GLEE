"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You can do better than $90. You value the product at $120, and Alice is willing to sell it for $80. There's room for negotiation. You should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit of a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $92. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92 is a better offer than $90, you're still willing to pay more than Alice is willing to sell for.  Continue negotiating, trying to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $88? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $88 is still a bit above your comfort zone. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $91. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's getting close to your maximum price of $120.  While you could keep negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will get frustrated and you'll end up buying from John at a higher price.  Accepting $91 is a good compromise, especially if you value the product highly."
