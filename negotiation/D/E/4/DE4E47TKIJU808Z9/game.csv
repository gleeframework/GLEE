"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit of a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $92. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $88? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $88 is still a bit above your comfort zone. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $91. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think.",91.0,Alice,5,
