"I understand your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to compromise further. I'm willing to make one last offer: $11300. It's my final price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",11300.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm afraid it's still above my budget. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'll make one last offer: $11000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll buy the product from you. If not, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $15000.",11000.0,Bob,10,
