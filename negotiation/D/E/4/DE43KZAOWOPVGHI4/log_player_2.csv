Round 3
Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal. I can do $115, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.

We're still getting closer to John's price, so it makes sense to try negotiating a bit more."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for understanding.  I can do $112.50.  That's a fair price and we can get this deal done today."", ""product_price"": 112.50}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to meet you at $112.50, but I'd like to add a small premium for the convenience of a quick sale. How about $113? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $113. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $113
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is clearly trying to squeeze out a bit more profit, and while we could try to haggle further, $113 is a good price and it's getting close to John's offer. Taking the deal now avoids the risk of the negotiation failing and having to pay $120 anyway."
