"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for bargaining while still ensuring I maximize potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still below the value Bob places on the product. I believe I can negotiate a higher price with further rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to squeeze out more, Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, and we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a price that's profitable for me."
