"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment.  I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,150,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There are still 9 rounds left, giving Bob the opportunity to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $1,150,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, as this aligns with my maximum spending limit.  I believe this is a fair starting point for further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  Bob is making a significant move down from Alice's offer, but it's not completely unreasonable.  It demonstrates his commitment to negotiation but also sets a clear limit.
* **Focus on Value:**  The message emphasizes Bob's budget limitations while hinting at the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still a gap between Bob's offer and Alice's value, leaving space for further rounds of counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,120,000. This is a fair compromise, reflecting the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Bob has already shown a willingness to walk away and has 7 more rounds to try and secure a lower price. It's worth continuing to negotiate in hopes of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,120,000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,085,000. This would represent a significant savings for me while still offering you a substantial price."", ""product_price"": 1085000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Bob is proposing a price that is halfway between his previous offer and Alice's current offer, demonstrating a genuine desire to find a solution.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Bob emphasizes the savings for him while also acknowledging the value Alice is placing on the product.
* **Building on Progress:**  This counteroffer reflects the progress made in negotiations and positions Bob for a potential agreement in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on the value of this product. I'm willing to accept $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $1,100,000, Bob has only 5 rounds left.  The risk of further negotiation is high, especially since Alice has declared this her ""final offer.""  The potential for further savings is minimal compared to the certainty of getting the product from John for $1,000,000. It's time to secure the deal with John to avoid the risk of losing the opportunity to buy the product at a reasonable price."
