"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $1,150,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, as this aligns with my maximum spending limit.  I believe this is a fair starting point for further negotiation.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,120,000. This is a fair compromise, reflecting the true worth of what's being offered.",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,120,000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,085,000. This would represent a significant savings for me while still offering you a substantial price.",1085000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on the value of this product. I'm willing to accept $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
