"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, while still allowing you to make a good profit. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $850,000 is significantly below what I'd be willing to accept.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle at $1,000,000? This allows me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a price lower than my initial offer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $925,000.  This price is fair for both of us, and allows us to move forward with the deal. What do you say?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $925,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a slightly higher price.  Would you consider $975,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.",975000.0,Alice,5,
