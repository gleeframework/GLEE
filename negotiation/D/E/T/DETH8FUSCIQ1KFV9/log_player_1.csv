"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your business, and I'm happy to discuss a deal. To start, I propose a price of $1,600,000.  This is reflective of its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** I offer a reason for the high price, framing it around the product's potential value to Bob's business, rather than its objective worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language used (""happy to discuss"", ""To start"") signals that this is an opening offer and I'm willing to negotiate.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize potential profit:**  If Bob accepts, I secure a great deal.
2. **Understand Bob's position:** His response will reveal how badly he wants the product and how flexible he's willing to be on price. 
 
Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I recognize the potential of this product, your initial price is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which reflects its value to me. I'm open to discussing further, but this is my maximum offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived value of the product, and significantly below my minimum. Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to selling to John. While his message suggests limited flexibility, I'll counter-offer to explore if a mutually beneficial deal is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is below what I had in mind, I understand the value needs to make sense for both of us.  How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000? This reflects my investment and the significant potential of the product for your business."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** I acknowledge Bob's perspective and reiterate my desire for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Strategic Compromise:** Offering a price halfway between our previous positions ($1,600,000 and $1,000,000) signals flexibility and encourages movement on his part.
* **Reiterating Value:** I subtly remind Bob of the product's potential, subtly anchoring the negotiation around its benefits, not just the price.

This approach aims to:

* **Find a Middle Ground:**  While still above my minimum, the compromise encourages Bob to consider a higher price point. 
* **Maintain Control:** I avoid drastically dropping my price, demonstrating the product's value and my seriousness about the negotiation. 
* **Assess Bob's Flexibility:** His response will reveal if there's room for further negotiation or if John's offer is the better option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However, $1,300,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm firm on my offer of $1,000,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product.  I'm open to further discussion, but I won't be able to go higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now reiterated his maximum offer of $1,000,000 twice and explicitly stated he won't go higher.  This indicates he's unlikely to budge significantly. Continuing the negotiation would likely result in minimal gains, with the risk of Bob walking away entirely. 

Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, making it the most profitable decision at this point. While I might have been able to squeeze a bit more from Bob with continued negotiation, the time and effort involved don't outweigh the relatively small potential gain."
