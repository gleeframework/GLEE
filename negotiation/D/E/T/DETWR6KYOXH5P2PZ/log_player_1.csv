"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:** This allows for potential counteroffers without immediately resorting to John's offer.
* **Maximizing Potential:** By starting high, I have the potential to secure a higher price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Negotiation Room:**  I'm rejecting to continue negotiating.  I believe there's still room to secure a price closer to my desired $9,500. 
* **Avoiding John's Offer:**  While John is a safety net, I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $9,500 to $9,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:**  This price is still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial price, creating a potential meeting point.
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Reached:** Bob's offer is now at my absolute minimum. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  We've gone back and forth, and it seems like there's no room for further negotiation.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could result in more rounds with no guarantee of a better deal.  John's offer provides a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
