"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows you to make a decent profit while still being within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. I believe we can reach an agreement at this price. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that still gives you a solid profit and is within my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
