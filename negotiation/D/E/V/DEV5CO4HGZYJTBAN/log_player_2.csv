"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it, given the value I place on it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. This shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product but are also firm about your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that $150 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still above your maximum budget of $100.  It's worth continuing to negotiate, especially since you already have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really only able to go up to $95 at this point. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to push for a lower price, but it also shows Alice that you are willing to compromise. Offering $95 keeps you within your budget while leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $95, which would be $102.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your $100 limit. You have a solid alternative with John, so it's worth pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $102.50 is still a bit too much for me. I'm really only able to go up to $100. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're now at your absolute limit. This offer signals to Alice that you're serious about buying but won't go higher. Since you have a backup option with John, you don't have to be afraid to walk away if Alice doesn't accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to give you a small concession and offer it to you for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is still slightly above your $100 limit.  You have a backup option with John who is willing to sell the product for your target price, so it's best to take the guaranteed deal with John.  There's a good chance that Alice won't budge any further, and it's not worth risking losing a good deal with John."
