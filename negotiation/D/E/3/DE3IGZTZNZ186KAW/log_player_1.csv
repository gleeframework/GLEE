Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than the maximum I think I can get from Bob, but still leaving room for negotiation if necessary. This strategy balances the need to maximize my profit with the possibility of losing the deal if I ask for too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I'm hoping to get. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $85 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $75? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum than Bob's initial offer, it's still not a great price for me.  I've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and I'm concerned that we're getting stuck in a back-and-forth that may not lead to a profitable outcome for me. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed sale to John for $80."
