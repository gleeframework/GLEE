"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $17,000 is still too much for me.  I'm really interested in the product but can only go as high as $12,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,
