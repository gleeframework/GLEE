"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a little too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
