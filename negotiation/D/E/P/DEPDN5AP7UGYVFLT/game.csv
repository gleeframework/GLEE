"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I'm willing to pay that much, but I don't think it's worth more than that.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $1200000 doesn't reflect the true value of this exceptional product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1350000, but I can't go any lower. This price still allows for a fair profit for me and reflects the product's potential benefit to you.  Please consider this final offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but I think that's the maximum I can go.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but $1250000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'm offering you the product for $1300000. This would be my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to accept this, I will be forced to sell the product to another buyer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
