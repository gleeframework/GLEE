"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my asking price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Buying from Alice saves you money:**  Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly less than John's price of $1,500,000.
* **Your goal is to save money:** As a rational buyer, you want to minimize your spending while still acquiring the product. 
* **The product's value to you is unknown:** While the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, its value to you is not stated. Therefore, even at $1,200,000, you could potentially still be getting a good deal based on your own assessment of its worth."
