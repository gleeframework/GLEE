"Alice, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. While I see the potential of the product, I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time. I'm confident this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is significantly lower than the product's value. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1200000. This price reflects a reasonable discount while still allowing me to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $900000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. $900000 is still below my minimum threshold, but I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a final offer from me. Let me know if you're able to accept it.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
