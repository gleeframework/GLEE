"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way over his budget and he can get the same product from John for $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, as he might be able to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $18,000 is a fair starting point considering the value this product brings.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $15,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product for $12,000 from John. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if he can get a price closer to his goal."
