"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than your proposed price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both parties.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum. This price aligns with the value I see in the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer a price of $1,225,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
