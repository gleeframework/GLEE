"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, at $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum price of $8,000, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate down from there. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to lower the price in the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum price, it's still lower than I'd like to sell for. I want to see if I can push for a higher price with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $9,800. This is a slight increase from his offer, but still leaves room for potential negotiation in the next round. It signals that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a slightly better price.  While $9,600 is getting closer to my ideal, I believe there's still room to negotiate. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9700}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,700. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but still value the product highly.  We're getting closer, and hopefully, this will be enough to get a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,650
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is the best offer Bob has made so far, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer secures a sale for $9,650, which is significantly higher than selling to John for $8,000."
