Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. However, the product's unique qualities and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This offer reflects the true worth of what you're gaining."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

At this point, Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than risk Bob not reaching an acceptable price within the remaining rounds."
