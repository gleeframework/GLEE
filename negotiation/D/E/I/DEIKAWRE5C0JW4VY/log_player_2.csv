"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is far too high. It makes much more sense to negotiate a lower price, especially since we have the backup option of buying from John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a much lower price. How about we start around $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is significantly lower than my asking price, I'm willing to negotiate further.  How about $1,200,000? This is a price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit and acknowledges the value you place on the product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $1,200,000 is still much higher than our ideal price and our fallback option. We should continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still quite a stretch for me. I'm serious about buying, but I need to see a price closer to my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. I'm confident this offer provides a good value for you, while still allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is making progress, but $1,000,000 is still a significant amount over our fallback price of $800,000. We need to push Alice a bit further and see if she's willing to come down closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. Your product is definitely valuable, but to be honest, $1,000,000 is pushing the limits of what I can justify spending. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? That's a substantial offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you're agreeable."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However,  $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's split the difference and settle on $925,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good outcome.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $925,000 is getting closer, it's still a significant markup from John's offer. We're in a strong negotiating position with our fallback option, so let's push Alice a bit further. We're running out of rounds, but getting a good deal is important."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down further. To be completely transparent, I do have another offer on the table, and to make a deal with you work, I'd need the price to be right. Would you be willing to consider $875,000? That's a firm offer from me, and I think it's more than fair considering the circumstances."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have other offers, but I believe this product is worth more than what you're offering. To make this deal work, I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and allows me to still achieve a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal now before it's too late. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

We've reached a point where Alice is unlikely to come down significantly further. While $900,000 is closer to our preferred price, we're better off taking the guaranteed offer from John for $800,000. It's not worth risking a worse deal from Alice in the final round."
