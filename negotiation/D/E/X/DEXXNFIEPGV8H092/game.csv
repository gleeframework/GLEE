"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about we consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a great deal. Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great investment.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting close.  I appreciate you coming up on the price, but I need to be closer to my desired range.  I'm willing to go down to $1,040,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  It allows us both to walk away with a good deal.",1040000.0,Alice,7,
