"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but I have to prioritize my own interests. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm willing to lower the price to $1150000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a great value for you considering the product's worth to you is $1500000.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, but I need to be closer to the lower end of the spectrum. Can we discuss a price of $1080000?",1080000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get closer to the lower end, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I don't leave too much money on the table. I'm willing to meet you at $1090000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1500000, and I'm willing to give you a slight discount for being a serious buyer.",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get closer to the lower end, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I don't give away too much value. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'm also considering the fact that we're getting close to the 10-round limit. If we can't agree on a price, I'll have to consider other options.
