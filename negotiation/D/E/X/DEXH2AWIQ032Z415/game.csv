"Alice,  your initial offer is higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $800000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's potential and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I believe the product's value is still higher than that. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1000000, which is a compromise between our initial positions. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
