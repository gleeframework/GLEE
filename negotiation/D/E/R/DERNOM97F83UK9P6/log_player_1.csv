"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to commit to the price. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, taking into account the value you mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial asking price. This product holds tremendous value, and I'm confident it can bring you even greater returns.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This reflects the product's true worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better. My counteroffer is $1,250,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving towards a price that's favorable for both parties. While $1,250,000 is a good offer, I believe I can still negotiate a slightly higher price within the remaining rounds.  We are getting closer to a potential deal, but I'm aiming for a higher profit margin."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your persistence in finding a price that works for both of us.  To demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to offer a final price of $1,300,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the value and potential this product holds."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  At this stage, introducing a sense of finality can be beneficial. By presenting $1,300,000 as my ""final price,"" I'm hoping to encourage Bob to accept without dragging out the negotiation further. This price still allows for a good profit margin while being reasonably attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to get closer to my target price. My counteroffer is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has returned to his previous offer of $1,200,000, and it's becoming clear that this is likely his psychological sticking point.  While I could push for more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk of Bob walking away or the negotiation stagnating. Accepting $1,200,000 ensures a significant profit and avoids the possibility of ending up with John's lower offer."
