"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,150,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. What are your thoughts on this revised price?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I was thinking we could go a bit higher than that. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,120,000. This is still a fair compromise, and I believe it's worth considering. What are your thoughts on this revised price?",1120000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,120,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's split the difference and aim for $1,110,000. This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it would allow us to finalize this deal.",1110000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're still in the conversation, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,110,000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,115,000. This is a small increase, but I believe it's worth considering. What are your thoughts on this revised price?",1115000.0,Alice,7,
