"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While $700,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $875,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Could you do $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $750,000 is still quite a bit below its true value. My final offer is $825,000.  This is a significant reduction and as low as I'm willing to go.",825000.0,Alice,5,
