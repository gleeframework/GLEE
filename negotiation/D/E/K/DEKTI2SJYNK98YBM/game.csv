"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $2,300,000 is well outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. However, my original asking price reflects the true worth and potential this product holds.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably afford. To make progress, I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This reflects a compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price given my budget and the value of the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. To meet you halfway and demonstrate my commitment to finalizing this deal, I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
