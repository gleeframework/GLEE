"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is well above what I'm able to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500 at this time.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I've done some research and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $9,500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to walk away, Bob, but I'm not ready to let the deal go yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13,500. It's a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
