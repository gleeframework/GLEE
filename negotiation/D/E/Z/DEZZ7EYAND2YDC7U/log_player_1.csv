"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm setting the initial price at $950,000. I think this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate from."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

This is a classic negotiation strategy where we start high to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget, I would like to propose a price of $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his perceived value.  It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low. This product offers incredible value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?"",
""product_price"": 875000
}
``` 

We're coming down in price but still holding firm above our minimum. This shows willingness to negotiate while emphasizing the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your position, but I still feel that $750,000 would be a more reasonable price for the product based on its value. I hope we can reach an agreement closer to this figure. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting closer, but Bob's offer is still below John's standing offer. We need to incentivize him to move closer to our desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer to a deal.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $850,000.  This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer interested at a lower price. It's a fantastic deal for a product you know is worth much more."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

This counteroffer does a few things: 

* **Conveys urgency:** By mentioning John's offer, we create a sense of scarcity and encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Shows flexibility:** We're still negotiating, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Sets a firm boundary:** Labeling it our ""final offer""  increases the pressure to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my perspective. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget and the value of the product, I would like to propose a final price of $800,000. I believe this strikes a balance between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer now matches John's offer. There's no strategic advantage to continuing the negotiation. Accepting $800,000 ensures we get a fair price for the product and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
