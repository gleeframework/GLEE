Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum price point. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,100,000. I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,050,000? This would allow both of us to come away satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more, $1,000,000 is my minimum price point and aligns with my goal of getting at least that much for the product.  It's a good deal, and I'm happy to close it now."
