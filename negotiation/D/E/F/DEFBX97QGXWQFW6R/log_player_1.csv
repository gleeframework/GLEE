"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,800,000."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer above your desired price. This leaves room for concessions and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he negotiates you down.
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, I aim to ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he never intended to pay close to $1,800,000, this initial offer influences his counter-offer.
* **Leaving Room for John:** I need to leave myself significant negotiation space before reaching John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum price and his own perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. It's clear we're far apart in our valuations, so I need to counter-offer strategically to bridge the gap.  There's still room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table. However,  your offer is significantly below the true value of this product.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Controlled Concession:**  A $300,000 decrease shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but it keeps me well above both his offer and my minimum. 
* **Justification:**  By re-emphasizing the product's value, I'm trying to shift his focus away from his initial lowball offer.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  It's important to keep the negotiation moving to find a potential agreement point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find some middle ground.  $1,500,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. I'll counter with $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is now showing more willingness to move, his offer is still too low.  He's increased his offer by $150,000 while I decreased mine by $300,000. This pattern suggests I have more negotiating power.  I need to hold firm and signal that I'm not going to make significant concessions unless he does the same. John's offer is starting to look more appealing, but I'll give Bob one more round to show serious movement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and so am I.  However, we need to find a price point that reflects the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle â€“ I can do $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm dropping another $150,000, matching Bob's previous increase. This shows a willingness to negotiate but also puts the ball in his court to reciprocate with a significant move of his own.
* **Middle Ground:** By saying ""meet in the middle,"" I'm suggesting that $1,350,000 is a compromise, even though it's still closer to my previous offer than his.
* **Deadline Pressure:**  While I haven't explicitly mentioned John, Bob knows I have other options. This offer, along with the emphasis on finding a solution, subtly introduces a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,050,000. I believe that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still significantly below my $1,200,000 minimum. While he increased his offer by $100,000, I decreased mine by $300,000 in the previous round.  It's crucial to show him that I'm not going to settle for a price that's too far below my minimum, especially when John is waiting in the wings.  I'll make a final counteroffer this round to pressure him, and if he doesn't meet it, I'll sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I have other interested buyers, and to make this deal work, I need to see a significant jump closer to my asking price. My final offer is $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear this is my last move. The limited time should encourage Bob to act decisively. 
* **Justified Stance:** By mentioning other buyers, I'm reiterating that I have alternative options if he won't meet a price closer to my valuation.
* **Strategic Concession:**  A $100,000 reduction shows some flexibility but keeps the pressure on Bob to make a substantial counter-offer to reach a deal.
* **Protecting My Interests:** While I'm willing to negotiate, this final offer ensures I don't go too far below my minimum acceptable price."
