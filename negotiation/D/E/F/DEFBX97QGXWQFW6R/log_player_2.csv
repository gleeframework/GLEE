Round 7

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm on a price above your maximum. She's mentioned other buyers, signaling she might not go much lower. It's unlikely you'll negotiate her down another $150,000 in the remaining rounds.  You have a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000, which saves you money and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing."
