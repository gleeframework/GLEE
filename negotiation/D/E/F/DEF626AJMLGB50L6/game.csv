"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly special. I believe it's worth more than its face value of $120 to you, given its quality and benefits. Let's discuss a fair price that reflects its true value. How about we start at $150?",150.0,Alice,1,
