{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant value it holds for you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, giving us room to negotiate above our minimum price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 allows some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing within a range highly profitable for us.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** While a higher initial offer might scare Bob away, aiming too low leaves potential profit on the table. $925,000 balances this, making a successful sale highly likely.
* **Alternative Buyer as Leverage:** While not explicitly stated to Bob, having John as a backup ensures we won't be forced to accept a lowball offer from Bob out of desperation."
