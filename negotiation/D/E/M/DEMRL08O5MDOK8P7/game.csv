"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1000000. It's a rare opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it. Let's see if we can make this work.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, $700000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $850000 to acknowledge your budget constraints, but I'm firm on that price. This is a one-time opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $750000, which is a significant compromise on my part. This is the highest I can go, and I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your flexibility.  While $750000 is closer, it's still a bit short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Given your commitment, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800000. This price represents a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of this exceptional product. Let's finalize this deal and make it happen.",800000.0,Alice,5,
