"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm still willing to work with you. I can do $11,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, if you ask me!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a little hesitant to go that high.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That seems like a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm still a bit short on the profit margin. I can do $11,200, which is the next lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth it!",11200.0,Alice,5,
