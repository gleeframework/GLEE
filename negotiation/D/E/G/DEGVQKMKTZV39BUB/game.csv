"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This still allows you a significant profit, and it's closer to the value of the product for me.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1400000 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1500000. This price is fair, and it allows us both to make a good deal. Let's close this now.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
