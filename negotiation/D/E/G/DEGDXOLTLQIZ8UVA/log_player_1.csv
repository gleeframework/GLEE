I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to leave some room for negotiation.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to make it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because while it's my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to try to negotiate further to see if I can get more for the product."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. It's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm counting on you to meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise. I've already negotiated a bit, and I'm happy to close the deal at $13,000.  It's a good price for me, and it's likely that Bob won't make a higher offer."
