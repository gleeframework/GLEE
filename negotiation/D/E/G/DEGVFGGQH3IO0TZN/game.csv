"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $750000. I've done some research and I think this is a fair price for the product, considering its value and the current market.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the research I've done. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $825000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $750000.  Perhaps we can find a middle ground at $787500? This reflects a fair compromise and ensures a deal that benefits both of us.",787500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $787500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer $812500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",812500.0,Alice,5,
