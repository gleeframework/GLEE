"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to purchase a valuable asset at a reasonable price. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the market value.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $850,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows for a successful transaction. Let's find common ground and close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
