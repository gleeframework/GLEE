Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $850,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows for a successful transaction. Let's find common ground and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, she's still above your $800,000 limit. You have the option to buy from John at that price guaranteed. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice when you have a sure deal at your target price."
