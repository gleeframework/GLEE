{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll likely see."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,450,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit above your $1,200,000 minimum.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below that price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  It's unknown how much Bob is willing to pay above his perceived value. Our offer assumes he might be open to a small premium.
* **Negotiation Skills:** This initial offer sets the stage for potential back-and-forth negotiation."
