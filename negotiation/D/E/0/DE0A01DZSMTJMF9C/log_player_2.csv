"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price, and knows he can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. This initial counteroffer establishes Bob's maximum price and tests Alice's willingness to negotiate significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. There are still 7 rounds remaining, and Bob has a strong fallback option in John.  Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still remaining within his budget.  This counteroffer is a middle ground between his initial offer and Alice's latest one, potentially leading to a quicker deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,080,000, which is only $80,000 more than what Bob can get from John.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and potentially going back up in price, or even the negotiation collapsing, is high. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product within his budget with minimal risk."
