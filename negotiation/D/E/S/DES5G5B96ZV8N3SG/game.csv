"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is $8000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is your budget, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10000, which is still a great deal for you. I'm confident you'll find the product valuable enough to be worth the investment.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10000 is still a bit higher than I can afford. I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to go up to $9000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9500, which is still a good deal for both of us. I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9500 is still a little too high. My absolute maximum is $9000. If you can meet me there, we have a deal.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $9500, Bob. I've already met you halfway and I think it's a fair price for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at $9500, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",9500.0,Alice,7,
