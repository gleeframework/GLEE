{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

This offer starts with a high price, but it is still lower than what the product is worth to Bob. It also opens the door for negotiation and a possible compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it is still below my minimum of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $13,500. This is a fair compromise and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
