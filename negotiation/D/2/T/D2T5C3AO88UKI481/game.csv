"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase it. However, I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $18000 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations.",18000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was really hoping to get a better price for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $22000, which is a $3000 discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement. Based on my research and understanding of the market value, I would like to propose a price of $20000 for the product. This still allows you a reasonable profit while ensuring I receive a fair deal. I hope we can come to an agreement.",20000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $22000. I can see that you're trying to get a good deal, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the sale. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to make a bit more than $20000. I can do $21500, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",21500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my previous offers. I would like to propose a price of $21000 for the product. This still allows for a reasonable profit on your part while keeping the transaction within my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",21000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're still in talks, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not sure if $21000 is enough for me. I can see that you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that. But I need to think about my own bottom line. I'm willing to do $21250, and that's as low as I can go. I think that's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",21250.0,Alice,7,
