Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond the $10,000 you estimate.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize your potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Maintain a Reasonable Price:** While aiming high, the price shouldn't be ridiculously above Bob's perceived value.  A price of $19,000 is a significant markup but might still be enticing if the product offers additional, less quantifiable benefits to Bob. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob will reject this offer. However, it's a calculated risk to potentially secure a much higher profit than selling to John directly."
