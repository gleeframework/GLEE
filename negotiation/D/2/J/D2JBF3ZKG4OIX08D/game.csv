"Alice,  $1,750,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend at this time. Given the value of the product to me, I'd be happy to pay $1,400,000.  Let me know if this is a price we can work with.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,600,000, which still reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000? This seems like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while also reflecting my budget.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
