Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding your minimum selling price ($12,000).
* **Negotiating Room:**  Starting with $11,999 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still guarantees you a profit if he accepts.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $12,000. This gives you leverage in the negotiation."
