"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is very close to her value and doesn't leave much room for negotiation. You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and go with your backup plan."
