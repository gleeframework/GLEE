"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob, making the offer seem more attractive. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message signals a willingness to negotiate, avoiding a quick rejection. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to achieve a price closer to my minimum value of $15,000, while also acknowledging Bob's potential counteroffers.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $12,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it's a starting point for further negotiation. I still have 8 rounds to reach a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John:**  Although selling to John would guarantee $15,000, I believe I can potentially get a better price from Bob through further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round with a price closer to my desired range, aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $15,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** I'm proposing my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, which is still higher than Bob's last offer.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm emphasizing fairness and mutual benefit to encourage Bob to reconsider.
* **Direct Approach:** I'm aiming for a quick resolution by directly stating my final price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm pushing for a deal at my minimum acceptable price, hoping to close the deal in this round. If Bob rejects again, I'll have to weigh selling to John against further negotiation with Bob, considering the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. This still leaves room for you to gain some profit while ensuring a reasonable cost for me. I hope you'll consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While $13,000 is closer to my desired range, I believe I can still secure a better price with further negotiation.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John guarantees $15,000, I'm still open to negotiating with Bob, especially since we've already made some progress.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer again in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $15,000. I'll carefully assess the remaining rounds and adjust my strategy accordingly. If Bob continues to reject offers, I'll consider selling to John as the rounds dwindle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is a fair compromise considering its value to you.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:** I'm making another concession, lowering my price by $1,000 to demonstrate my willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I'm framing my offer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a slight sense of urgency by suggesting they ""close this deal,"" hinting at the potential for a deal to fall through if he doesn't accept.

**Strategy:**

I'm strategically lowering my price in smaller increments to show flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value. I'm also trying to motivate Bob to accept by emphasizing the fairness of the offer and the possibility of losing the deal. I'll assess Bob's response in the next round and adapt my strategy accordingly."
