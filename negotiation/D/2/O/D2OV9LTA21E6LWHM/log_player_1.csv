Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) but still lower than the maximum Bob is willing to pay ($1,200,000). This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  I'm leaving room for negotiation but ensuring I'm starting in a favorable position.
* **Test Bob's interest:** If he immediately rejects this price, it indicates he's likely not serious about buying and I can move on to John.

However, I'm keeping in mind:

* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob.
* **Negotiation potential:** I'm willing to negotiate, as it's possible to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm not desperate to sell and have a guaranteed buyer in John. Therefore, I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining profit:**  This price is still within my desired profit range, allowing me to potentially earn more than from selling to John.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer tests Bob's seriousness. If he accepts, we have a deal. If he rejects, we can continue negotiating or I can opt to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's clear that further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to lead to a better outcome. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price, it's more advantageous to sell the product to John. This decision ensures a higher profit than accepting Bob's offer."
