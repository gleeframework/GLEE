Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $120, aiming for a higher price with Bob first allows us to potentially earn more.
* **Reasonable Markup:** A price of $110 represents a reasonable markup from Bob's perceived value ($80) while still being lower than your guaranteed sale price to John.
* **""Special Offer"" Framing:**  By framing the offer as a ""special price,"" it creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob."
