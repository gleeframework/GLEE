"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You want to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than $12,000, you can likely get a better deal.  Since you have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for $8,000, rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer represents a significant drop from Alice's initial price.  It's still above your ideal price of $8,000, but it demonstrates your willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is closer to your ideal price, you're still only one round away from being able to buy from John for $8,000.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and might lead to a better price.  You're demonstrating your commitment to getting the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's closer to Alice's offer of $8,500 but still lower.  This shows Alice you're serious about buying the product, but you're not willing to overpay.  You're also getting closer to your target price of $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,750 is a very good price, you're now in a position where you can buy the product from John for $8,000, which is your ideal price.  There's no guarantee that you'll get a lower price from Alice in the remaining rounds, and risking it is not worth potentially losing the opportunity to buy at your target price."
