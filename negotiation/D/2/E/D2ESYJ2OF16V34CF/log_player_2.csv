"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within his budget, it's still higher than Alice's value of $100. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer opens the opportunity to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Strategy:**  Offering $120 splits the difference between Alice's value ($100) and Bob's maximum ($150). This shows good faith while still leaving room for potential compromise.
* **Negotiation Space:**  This counteroffer gives Alice room to accept or make a counteroffer without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $130 is closer to Bob's desired price range than his previous counteroffer and is within his budget. 
* **Risk of Delay:** Continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Accepting the offer now keeps the relationship with Alice open for potential future transactions where Bob might be able to negotiate even better prices."
