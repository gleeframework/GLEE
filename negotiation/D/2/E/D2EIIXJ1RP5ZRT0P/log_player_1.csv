I'm going to start with my ideal price, $12,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's what John is willing to pay.  Bob knows he's getting a good deal at $10,000, so I'll see if he's willing to bridge the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and I'm confident I can't get a better deal from him. It's also a much better price than what John is offering.  I'll take it!"
