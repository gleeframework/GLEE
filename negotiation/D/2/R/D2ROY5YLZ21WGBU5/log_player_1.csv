"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value. This sets a strong baseline and gives me room to negotiate.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to me.  This might make Bob more receptive to a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not aiming for a full $1,000,000 profit in the first round.  There's room to compromise throughout the negotiations.

**Important Note:** I'm aware that Bob could simply reject this offer. My strategy is to use the remaining rounds to see if I can secure a better deal than the $1,000,000 John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly less than what I need to make a profit. 
* **More rounds to negotiate:** I still have 8 rounds left.  This gives me ample time to try to reach a more favorable agreement with Bob.
* **Maintaining my position:**  Rejecting this offer shows Bob that I'm not desperate and that I'm willing to hold out for a better deal.

**Next Round:**  I will make a counteroffer that is higher than $600,000 but lower than my initial $1,200,000 offer. This will show Bob I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a significant improvement on your previous offer. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but I'm not giving away too much.
* **Justification:** I'm explaining my reasoning for the counteroffer, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Setting a New Baseline:** This counteroffer sets a new price range for negotiations. 
* **Room for More Negotiation:** I'm still leaving room for potential compromises in future rounds.

**Strategic Thinking:**

I believe that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob than his initial offer, while still keeping me in a favorable position. I'm aiming for a quick agreement but I'm also prepared for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While $750,000 is a significant increase from Bob's previous offer, it's still below my desired minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **Significant negotiation progress:** Bob is getting closer to my desired price point. I'm willing to continue negotiations to see if we can bridge the gap.
* **Remaining rounds:**  I still have six rounds to work with.  I'm confident that with continued negotiation, I can secure a deal closer to my target.

**Next Round:** I will counteroffer with a price higher than $750,000 but lower than my previous $900,000 offer. This will show continued flexibility while maintaining my goal of achieving a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $850,000. This is a fair compromise and a good step towards reaching an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer of $900,000 and Bob's current offer of $750,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to accept.
* **Progress towards agreement:**  This counteroffer shows that we're making progress towards a deal.  It's also a good opportunity to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my target.

**Next Steps:**  I'm optimistic that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary.  I'm still aiming to secure a price as close to $1,000,000 as possible, but I'm also aware of the potential of accepting a slightly lower offer if it means closing a deal in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, my absolute maximum budget for this product is $800,000.  If you're willing to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal right now.  Otherwise, I'll unfortunately have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Limited time:** We're already in round 6, meaning I have only 4 rounds left before I have to make a decision to sell to John.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I continue to reject Bob's offer, he might walk away, leaving me with no buyer at all. 

**Next Steps:**  While I would prefer to get closer to my desired $1,000,000, accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a sale and a significant profit.  Given the limited time and the risk of losing the deal entirely, accepting is the most logical decision."
