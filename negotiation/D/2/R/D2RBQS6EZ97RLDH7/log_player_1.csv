{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm willing to let it go for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and potentially feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Setting the Stage:**  My message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in a dialogue. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Profit:** I'm starting high, hoping to get as close to my minimum as possible.
* **Avoid John:** I'd rather sell to Bob if possible, since a higher price is ideal. 
* **Encourage Negotiation:** By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I create a more dynamic and potentially successful interaction with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still do better. 
* **Negotiation Advantage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the upper hand in the negotiation.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I still have John as an option if negotiations with Bob fall apart. 

My next counteroffer will aim to bridge the gap between $9,000 and my desired price, but I'll be prepared to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm open to negotiation, $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500?  That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. 
* **Fairness Appeal:** I emphasize ""fair deal"" to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** I'm willing to negotiate further if needed, but I'm not willing to go below $9,500 at this point.
* **John as Backup:** Remember, I still have John as a backup buyer if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $8,800 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, I still believe I can get a slightly higher offer.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control and can potentially push for a better deal. 
* **John is Ready:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me the confidence to hold out for a slightly better price. 

I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to $9,000, hoping to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. How about $9,200?  That's a compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for this product."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:**  This counteroffer is a last attempt to get closer to my desired price. It's a compromise from my previous offer, but still above Bob's latest offer.
* **Compromise Appeal:** I emphasize ""compromise"" and ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Closing the Gap:**  I'm hoping Bob will recognize that we're getting close to a mutually agreeable price and will accept this offer. 
* **John's Assurance:** I'm confident I can sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Room for Improvement:**  Bob has refused to budge from $8,800, which is below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time is Money:**  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a better result, and I'm risking losing John as a buyer.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit and eliminates the risk of a lower price.

It's time to move on and secure the deal with John."
