Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $8,200 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,200 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,800, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you place on this product. Let's make this work!"", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we say $8,400? I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good value for my money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $8,400 is still a good deal for me and ensures I don't lose out on the sale.  It's better than selling to John and leaves room for future potential gains with Bob."
