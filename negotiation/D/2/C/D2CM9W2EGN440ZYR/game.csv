"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering $1,100,000 for the product. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering $1,050,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on a price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
