Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and still leaving room for Bob to get a good deal. Here's why:

* **My profit:** I'll earn $200,000 more than if I sold to John.
* **Bob's gain:** He'll still get a $200,000 value from the product. 

This approach is likely to lead to a successful sale, as Bob has a strong incentive to accept the offer."
