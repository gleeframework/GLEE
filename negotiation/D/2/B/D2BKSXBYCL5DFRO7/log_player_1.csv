"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially get closer to Bob's perceived value while still getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $115 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a bit closer to my target.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to go down to $120.  It's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
I'm offering a price that's slightly lower than my initial offer, but still significantly higher than my minimum.  I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more than his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $118.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer secures a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or having to sell to John for a lower price."
