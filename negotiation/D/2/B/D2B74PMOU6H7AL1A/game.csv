"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's a fantastic opportunity for your company. My asking price is $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This price is still good for you, as it's well above your value for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  That's a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings to your company.  Let's work together to close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you a decent profit while I get a good price. Let's try to reach an agreement on this.",900000.0,Bob,4,
