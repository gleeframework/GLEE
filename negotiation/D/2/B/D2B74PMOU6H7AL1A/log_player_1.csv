"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's a fantastic opportunity for your company. My asking price is $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, but it's still within the range of what the product is worth to Bob.  This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that works for both of us.  If he rejects, I can adjust my offer down in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This price is still good for you, as it's well above your value for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still far below what the product is worth to me. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm not willing to settle for such a low price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  That's a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings to your company.  Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you a decent profit while I get a good price. Let's try to reach an agreement on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly closer to my desired price and still allows me to make a substantial profit.  I'm going to accept this offer and close the deal."
