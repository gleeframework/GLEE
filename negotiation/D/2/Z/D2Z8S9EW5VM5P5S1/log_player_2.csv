"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a special price of $1,400,000.  This is a significant discount from its true worth, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a smart investment.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, but she's offering it to me for $1,400,000. That's still a significant markup. I can do better by buying it from John for $800,000.
