Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to meet you at $125, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a good deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut your losses.  Alice is unlikely to go below $125, and you have a guaranteed offer from John at $120. You've done well negotiating, but sometimes the best deals are the ones you don't make (with a particular seller)."
