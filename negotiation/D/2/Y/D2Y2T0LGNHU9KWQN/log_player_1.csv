"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me is much higher. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than what I value the product at ($15,000).  I'm willing to see if I can get closer to my ideal price by continuing the negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $9,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to my ideal price than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than what I value the product at ($15,000).  I'm still willing to see if I can get closer to my ideal price by continuing the negotiation.  I'm also starting to run out of rounds and need to be more aggressive to get the best deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to stick with $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I still need to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $9800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 4 rounds left, the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob are slim. While $9,800 is close to my bottom line, it's still not ideal.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a much better outcome and minimizes the risk of ending up with a lower price."
