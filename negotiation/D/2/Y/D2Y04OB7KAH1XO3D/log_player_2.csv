"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would really appreciate. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's still very fair for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Your Value:** The product is worth $120 to you.
* **Alice's Value:** The product is worth $80 to Alice.
* **Alice's Offer:**  $100

By accepting Alice's offer, you save $20 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, the offer is already within your budget and saves you money."
