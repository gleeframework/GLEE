"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering it's worth much more to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $15,000 maximum and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 isn't quite where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm sure we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a price I'm comfortable with, I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and propose something a bit lower in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle on $9,750? That seems like a reasonable compromise."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

We're splitting the difference between her last offer and our previous counteroffer.  This shows we are willing to negotiate but also sets a firm target."
