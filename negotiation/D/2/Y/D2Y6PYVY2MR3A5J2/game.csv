"Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, so I'm willing to offer it to you for $140.  Let me know if you're interested!",140.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $140 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  How about $130? I'm sure we can find a middle ground.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a better price, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?",135.0,Alice,3,
