"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $7,500? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I need to stay above $8,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
