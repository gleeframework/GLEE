"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $6,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $5,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",5500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $6,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering its value to you.",6000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $6,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $5,750.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",5750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $6,200. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm offering it to you for $6,200. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",6200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate further.  While $6,200 is closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $5,900. It's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can finalize this deal. What do you say?",5900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $5,900. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $6,200 and $5,900, which would be $5,550. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you.",5550.0,Alice,7,
