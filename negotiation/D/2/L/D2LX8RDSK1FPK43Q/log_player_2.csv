"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a better price than John's offer, you're aiming to save as much as possible. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is a better strategy to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product but $110 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you be willing to go down to $105? "", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can do $108, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is a good compromise. It's lower than her original offer and only $3 higher than your ideal price.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will reject your next counteroffer and you might end up paying more with John. Accepting her offer secures a good price and avoids further negotiation."
