""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I offer it more broadly."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 sets a strong initial point. It's above Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning that Alice will offer the product ""more broadly,"" she subtly introduces a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial price is high, it's essential to leave room for negotiation.  Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can then decide whether to accept, slightly reduce the price, or stand firm.

**Important Note:**  Alice knows she has a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John. Therefore, she should be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet a price point that's significantly beneficial for her."
