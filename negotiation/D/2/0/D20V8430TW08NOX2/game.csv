"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. It's a unique item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to me is at least $1500000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the exclusivity of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1800000 price point. Could we possibly negotiate down to a price closer to $1500000 which aligns better with my financial situation?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1500000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me is at least $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1700000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's exclusivity and value.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not able to meet the $1700000 price point. Given my budget constraints, could we possibly negotiate down to a price closer to $1600000 which would allow us to reach an agreement?",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still trying to reach a price that works for you, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1650000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
