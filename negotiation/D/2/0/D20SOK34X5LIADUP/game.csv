"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to do $90? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $105? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great deal for you.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a little out of my range.  Let's split the difference again. Would you consider $100?  I'm really serious about getting this product and  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
