"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $65. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $90 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $75? That's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $75, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle again at $82.50? It's still a good price for the product, and I think it's a fair deal.",82.5,Alice,5,
