Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me though. I'm looking to spend closer to  $6,000.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, $7,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind.  I'm willing to make my final offer at $10,500.  I believe this represents a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your counter offer. That's getting closer!  I could go up to $7,500, but that's really my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear that his price ceiling is far below your minimum. Continuing to negotiate risks wasting valuable time and potentially missing out on John's guaranteed offer."
