"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,500. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable deal.",15500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me though. I'm looking to spend closer to  $6,000.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product and its potential benefits for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Could you consider something closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, $7,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind.  I'm willing to make my final offer at $10,500.  I believe this represents a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your counter offer. That's getting closer!  I could go up to $7,500, but that's really my limit.",7500.0,Bob,6,
