Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:**  Ideally, you want to sell to Bob for more than $1,000,000, but less than or equal to $800,000 to make it worthwhile for him.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable to your operations. I'm willing to make this a win-win and am proposing a price of $750,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusive Opportunity:**  This phrasing subtly implies scarcity and value.
* **Win-Win:**  Frames the negotiation as mutually beneficial.
* **$750,000 Price:** This leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for you above your guaranteed price from John.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher than $750,000 to give yourself some wiggle room.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is paramount, you might be willing to go a bit lower to ensure he feels he got a fair deal. 

Let me know what you think! I'm here to help you refine your negotiation strategy."
