Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I want to start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value exceeding Bob's perception, potentially encouraging him to reconsider his valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price allows me to potentially lower the price during negotiation if Bob shows resistance while still aiming for a price higher than my minimum.

**Important Note:** While this strategy aims to maximize profit, there's a chance Bob will reject the offer outright. However, having a backup buyer mitigates this risk."
