{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $13,000.  Let me know if you're willing to work with that."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500. This is my final compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $14,500 is getting closer to my limit, I still have some room to negotiate. I'll see if I can get it lower before making a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000, and I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you at $14,250. This is my last compromise before I consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my limit, and we've already gone through several rounds. It's getting risky to keep negotiating, as we only have a few rounds left.  It's better to secure the product from John at a price I'm comfortable with."
