"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited about the potential of this product in your hands. Given its value to you, I'm offering it for $1,250,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, allowing both of us to benefit significantly. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. I believe this price allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, I still need to make sure this transaction is worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price allows for a significant profit for you and still covers my minimum requirements. Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is within your budget and still saves you $350,000 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your offer and potentially driving the price up is too high. Accepting her offer ensures you get the product at a good price."
