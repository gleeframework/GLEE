"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. I believe this price allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, I still need to make sure this transaction is worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price allows for a significant profit for you and still covers my minimum requirements. Let's find a way to make this work.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
