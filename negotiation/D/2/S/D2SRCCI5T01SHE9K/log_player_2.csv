You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is way above his budget. He can try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John for a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is already a competitive price for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He knows he can get the product for $8,000 from John, so he has some leverage."
