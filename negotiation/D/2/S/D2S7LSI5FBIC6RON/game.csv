,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, $65 is a bit too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm willing to go down to $90. This still gives you a great price on a great product.  What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and $75 is better than your initial offer.  But I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $82.50. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.  What do you say?",82.5,Alice,5,
