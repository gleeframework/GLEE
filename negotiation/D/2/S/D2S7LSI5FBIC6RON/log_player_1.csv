Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $110. It's a great deal for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I can then consider his counteroffer and either accept or make a counter-counteroffer.  At any point, I have the option to sell to John for $120 if I feel the negotiation isn't going anywhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, as it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $65 is a bit too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm willing to go down to $90. This still gives you a great price on a great product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a price closer to $90, as that's still a good deal for him and allows me to make a reasonable profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and $75 is better than your initial offer.  But I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $82.50. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 82.5}
