"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, $13,000 is unfortunately not a viable price for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  $14,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we compromise at $14,500?  This would allow us both to make a deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",14500.0,Alice,5,
