"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can potentially get the product for a lower price by counter-offering."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern, Bob. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than her previous offer, he can still potentially negotiate a lower price.  Additionally, John is offering the product for $1,000,000, making this a potential fallback option if negotiations with Alice fail."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1,037,500. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can understand my position.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While John is offering the product for $1,000,000, Alice's offer is only $37,500 more.  Further negotiation may not yield a significantly lower price, and Bob risks losing the deal altogether if he keeps rejecting offers. It's a good balance of getting a fair price while also minimizing the risk of losing the opportunity."
