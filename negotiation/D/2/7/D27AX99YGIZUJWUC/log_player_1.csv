""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob has the potential to be more profitable.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves a significant margin above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) while still being lower than John's guaranteed offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer allows for potential negotiation with Bob if he tries to counter-offer. 

The goal is to strike a balance: a price enticing enough for Bob to accept, but high enough to maximize profit for Alice."
