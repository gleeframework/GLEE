"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to what I value the product at.  Would you be willing to go down to $80?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. However, I must respectfully decline the counteroffer of $80. Considering the value you place on the product and my costs, I propose we settle on $95 for the product. This allows us to reach a fair agreement while still ensuring a reasonable profit for me.",95.0,Alice,3,
