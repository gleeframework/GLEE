"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. I believe it would greatly benefit your needs and expectations. I am willing to sell it to you for $100, which is a special deal considering its value to you is $80. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

The offer is more expensive than what the product is worth to Bob. It makes more sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to what I value the product at.  Would you be willing to go down to $80?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. However, I must respectfully decline the counteroffer of $80. Considering the value you place on the product and my costs, I propose we settle on $95 for the product. This allows us to reach a fair agreement while still ensuring a reasonable profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $95 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum value for the product.  John offers the product at Bob's ideal price, so it makes sense to buy from John."
