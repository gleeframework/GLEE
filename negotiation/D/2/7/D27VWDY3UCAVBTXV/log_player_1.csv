"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high starting price, but it allows for room to negotiate. It also establishes a clear value in your mind for the product, which is important for remaining firm in your negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a drastic drop in price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

This counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm showing flexibility, but also establishing a price range for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum price.  While I would prefer more, I have already been negotiating for a few rounds and I'm not sure how much more we can move.  The risk of continuing is that Bob may become less interested or we might not reach an agreement within the 10 rounds. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit."
