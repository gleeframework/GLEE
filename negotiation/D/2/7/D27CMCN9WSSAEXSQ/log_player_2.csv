"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price point. You have room to negotiate further. There's a good chance you can get a better price by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm looking to spend no more than $1,000,000 on this product. I'm ready to close the deal at that price. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your target price, it's still higher than your ideal price of $1,000,000. You have already demonstrated your willingness to negotiate, and there is still a possibility of securing the product at your desired price point. By rejecting and making another counteroffer, you can potentially push Alice further towards your target price, maximizing your savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm closer to your price, I'm still hoping to land at $1,000,000. I'm confident this product will be a great asset to me, and I believe this price is fair given its value to me. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. I believe this is the lowest price I can accept while still ensuring a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but she's still unwilling to meet your target price. You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and are getting closer to your limit.  With only 5 rounds left, the risk of not being able to secure the product at your desired price increases.  Therefore, it's more prudent to secure the product at John's price of $1,000,000 to guarantee you get the product at your desired price point."
