"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and confident to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open-Ended Question:** Asking what Bob thinks encourages him to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:** While $120 is my minimum, it's still worth trying to get a higher price.  Bob's interest shows he values the product.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my initial price, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome. 
* **Time Remaining:** With 9 rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $120 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $135? I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth that investment."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with Compromise:** I'm making a counteroffer that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining some profit margin.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider a higher price.
* **Positive and Open Tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. How about we meet at $125? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm trying to keep costs low. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $125 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Time Constraint:**  We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing the deal to John.
* **Compromise:** Bob has shown willingness to compromise, and this offer is a good middle ground. 
* **Potential for Future Deals:** If I build a good relationship with Bob, there might be future opportunities for sales where I can achieve a higher price."
