"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Please let me know if this is within your range.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,500 to make this work.  This price still leaves me some room to make a profit and allows you to get a good deal on a valuable product. Let's try to make this happen!",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I am still unable to meet you at $15,500. I would like to propose $14,000 as my final offer. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to go down to $14,500 to finalize this deal. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to sell the product and you to get a valuable item at a good rate.  Let's make this happen!",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $14,000 as my final offer. I believe this is a fair price for both parties involved.",14000.0,Bob,6,
