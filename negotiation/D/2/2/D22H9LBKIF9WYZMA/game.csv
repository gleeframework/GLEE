"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $10,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be well worth the investment.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $8,250. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and your desired price. Let's try to finalize this.",8250.0,Bob,4,
