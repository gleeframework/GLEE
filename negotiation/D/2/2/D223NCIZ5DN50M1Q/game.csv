"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $120? It's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a great deal for both of us, as you get a fantastic product at a good price, and I can still make a profit.  What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. How about $130? It's a good compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",130.0,Bob,4,
