"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth at least $8,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,500.  This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fair price. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,1,
