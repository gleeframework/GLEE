"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is more than Alice values the product for, it's still significantly less than your $15,000 maximum and the $15,000 John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you money."
