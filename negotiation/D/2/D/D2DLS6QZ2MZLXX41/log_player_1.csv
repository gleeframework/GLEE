Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,200,000?

Bob seems firmly rooted at $1,200,000.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price I find acceptable. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000 which is a better outcome for me."
