"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can get a better deal than $14,000.  Since Alice values the product at $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is within Bob's budget of $15,000 and is a better deal than buying from John for $15,000.  While there might be a slight chance of getting it for lower, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price is not worth it."
