"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this product. It's truly unique and I believe it could be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an ambitious offer. This anchors the negotiation at a higher point and leaves room for concessions. 
* **Knowing Your Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, so starting at that price makes sense. It ensures she doesn't accidentally sell it for less than its value to her. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it's clear that Alice is willing to negotiate by engaging in multiple rounds. This first offer gives Bob a chance to counter and begin the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in it. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value ($800,000) than Alice's minimum ($1,000,000). There's space for negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:**  Alice has the security of John's offer. This gives her leverage to hold out for a better price from Bob.
* **Early Stages:** It's only round 2. Rushing to accept an offer below Alice's minimum this early is not strategically sound."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, the product holds significant value beyond that price point. I'm willing to come down slightly, but need to stay closer to my initial figure. Would you consider $950,000?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Demonstrating Flexibility:** Alice lowers her price from $1,000,000 to $950,000, showing Bob she's willing to negotiate.
* **Significant Concession, But Not Too Much:** This drop is substantial enough to encourage Bob but keeps the offer well above his initial offer and closer to Alice's true value. 
* **Justification:**  Alice vaguely mentions the product's value exceeding Bob's offer, reinforcing her position without revealing too much. 
* **Encouraging a Counter:**  By asking ""Would you consider..."" Alice prompts a response from Bob and keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to meet your adjusted price. I would like to propose $900,000 as a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a willingness to pay more than his initial offer.
* **Still Below Value:** $900,000 is still less than Alice's minimum acceptable price. She has leverage with John's offer.
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:**  By rejecting this offer, Alice can gauge how much further Bob is willing to go to secure the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to meet you halfway to demonstrate my commitment to making this deal work. How about we settle on $925,000?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  Alice makes a calculated concession by offering a price exactly between her previous offer ($950,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($900,000). 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating she's ""willing to meet halfway,"" Alice injects a subtle sense of urgency, suggesting this could be a key point in the negotiation.
* **Fairness:**  The phrasing ""How about we settle..."" positions the compromise as a mutually beneficial solution, potentially making Bob more receptive. 
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:**  While this offer is a significant decrease from Alice's starting price, it's still a considerable profit above John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to compromise, Alice. I appreciate your effort. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to counteroffer at $910,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has steadily increased his offer throughout the negotiation, showing genuine interest and a willingness to pay more.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While not ideal, accepting $910,000 is still a significant profit for Alice.  Continuing to negotiate for a marginally better price (e.g., $915,000 or $920,000) might make Bob walk away entirely.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means Alice receives the money sooner.  There's an opportunity cost to prolonging negotiations and risking Bob accepting an offer from someone else. 

While Alice could likely push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal and settling for John's $1,000,000 offer outweighs the potential for a marginal increase at this point."
