Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for a price of $14,000. I believe this product will be very valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm eager to make a deal, $11,000 is below its true value. Could we settle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about $11,500? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

``` 
This is a good point to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $11,500 is a significant profit above your minimum price of $10,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away entirely. John's offer of $10,000 is a guaranteed fallback, but you'd be leaving $1,500 on the table.

By accepting Bob's offer now, you secure a good deal and avoid the potential for losing out on a sale.
