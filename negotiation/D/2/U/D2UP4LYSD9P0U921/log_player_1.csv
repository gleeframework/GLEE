Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial price is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $12,000.  It's the maximum I can spend, and I'm confident this is a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is firm at $12,000, which is my absolute bottom line. There's no room for further negotiation. Since John is offering my minimum acceptable price, it's time to move on and secure the sale with him."
