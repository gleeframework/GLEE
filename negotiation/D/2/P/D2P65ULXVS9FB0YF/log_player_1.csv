Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value but is still within a range that could potentially be appealing to him.  It also opens the door for negotiation and leaves room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum threshold, I'm not willing to accept it just yet. I believe I can secure a better price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint.  $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,250?  This is still a good deal for both of us, as it's below my asking price and closer to your offer."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10250 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $10000 for the product?  This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting his offer will allow me to secure the maximum value for the product without risking further negotiation or having to sell to John for the same amount."
