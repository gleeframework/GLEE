"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's a bad deal for me.  I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a good value for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is still below Alice's minimum price of $10,000, but it's a significant step towards my maximum budget. I'm trying to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate while keeping the offer reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, considering its value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is still too high for me. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above my comfort zone. I'm going to reject the offer and try to get a price closer to my $8,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I can manage. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to get the price as close to $8,000 as possible while still ensuring Alice doesn't reject the offer and I don't have to buy from John. I'm offering a price in the middle ground, aiming for a compromise that both parties can agree on. This offers Alice a price closer to her desired $10,000, while giving me a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,250. I'm willing to meet you at $9,750. This is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $9,750, this is still a significant amount above my ideal budget of $8,000. I'm not willing to give in to that price yet. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price before I resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer before I resort to buying from John. By offering $9,000, I'm showing my willingness to compromise while still staying within a reasonable price range. I'm hoping Alice will recognize the value of closing the deal and accept this offer. If not, I'll secure the product from John for $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,300. This is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,300 is still a significant amount above my budget of $8,000. I've already made multiple counteroffers and it seems like we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price. I've exhausted my negotiation options. I'm choosing to buy the product from John for $8,000 to ensure I get the product within my budget."
