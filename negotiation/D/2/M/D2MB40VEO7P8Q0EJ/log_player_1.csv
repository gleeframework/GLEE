Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's a bit higher than John's offer, but leaves room for bargaining. This strategy aims to maximize the potential profit while still being enticing to Bob, who knows the product is worth more to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I also need to make a profit on the sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than the product's value to him and my minimum threshold. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can secure a higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired range, and selling to John is always a fallback option if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so my new offer is $1,025,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is close enough to my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. While I would prefer a higher price, further negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and secures a decent profit."
