Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you. Given its unique value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,450,000."", ""product_price"": 1450000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to justify the high initial price.  
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I don't settle for anything less than $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $800,000 to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and my initial offer. Accepting would be a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While his offer is low, his message indicates interest.  There's space to negotiate upwards towards a more reasonable price.
* **Backup Plan:**  I still have the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price, giving me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer,  $800,000 is significantly below the market value of this product.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $1,300,000."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Above Minimum:** I've lowered my price considerably from $1,450,000 to $1,300,000, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still well above both Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Justify Value:** I'm reiterating the product's market value to counter his low offer and manage his expectations.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the significant price drop and respond with a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but so is my time.  $1,300,000 is still too far from what I'm willing to pay. If you're serious about selling, I could go up to $950,000.  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob has explicitly stated that $950,000 is his ""final offer,"" signaling limited room for further negotiation.
* **Unacceptable Price:** Even with his increase, $950,000 remains substantially below my $1,200,000 minimum. Accepting would result in a significant financial loss.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John provides a guaranteed sale at my desired price. It's strategically sound to choose a certain deal over the risk of continued negotiation with Bob, which might not lead to a mutually agreeable outcome."
