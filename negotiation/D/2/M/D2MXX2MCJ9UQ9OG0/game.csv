"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $800,000 to make this work.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer,  $800,000 is significantly below the market value of this product.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but so is my time.  $1,300,000 is still too far from what I'm willing to pay. If you're serious about selling, I could go up to $950,000.  That's my final offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
