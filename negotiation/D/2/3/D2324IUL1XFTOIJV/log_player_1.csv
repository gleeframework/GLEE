Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice is guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so she won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, meaning he'd benefit as long as he pays less than that.
* **The Zone of Agreement:**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,499,999 benefits both Alice and Bob.

**Alice's Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim high but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.  Here's an example offer:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,350,000 is significantly above Alice's minimum, but still well below Bob's valuation.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""potential worth,"" Alice provides a rationale for the high price without revealing her guaranteed offer from John.
* **Exclusivity:**  Framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a subtle psychological nudge, implying scarcity and value. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate a lower price. Alice would need to decide if she wants to counter, knowing she has a fallback option with John."
