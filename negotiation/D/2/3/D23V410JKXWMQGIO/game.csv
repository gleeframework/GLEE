"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value, and I'm open to discussing further. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,200,000 feels a bit low for me, considering the value you've described.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000.  This price reflects the product's potential, and I believe it's fair for both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to offer $1,350,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value and our previous discussions.
