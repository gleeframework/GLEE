"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand your perspective, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return on this product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a price that benefits both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both parties.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
