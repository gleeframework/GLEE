"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire my product.  It's a valuable asset that I believe can greatly benefit your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000, reflecting the true worth of this product. Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money on this deal. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his perceived value of the product, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  I have 10 rounds to work with, and I believe I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand your perspective, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return on this product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a price that benefits both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both parties."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 meets my minimum desired price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will lower his offer further or that I might not be able to reach a higher price in the remaining rounds.  Accepting this offer guarantees me my minimum desired price, and I can move on to other opportunities."
