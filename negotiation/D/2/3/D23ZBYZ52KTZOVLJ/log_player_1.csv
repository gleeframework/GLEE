Round 6

``` 

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is consistently moving upwards and we are getting close to the point where the gains from further negotiation might be less than the risk of him walking away. Accepting $1,192,500 is a strong return and surpasses the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
