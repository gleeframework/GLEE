{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to create room for negotiation. This will give me a higher starting point while still remaining competitive. I'm also emphasizing the value to him, hoping to incentivize him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's a good starting point for further negotiation, but I'm not willing to sell it at that price. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $11,000. This price still allows you a good value for the product while staying within my acceptable range. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
