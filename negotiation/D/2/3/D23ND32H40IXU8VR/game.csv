"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is still below what I can accept. Let's find a middle ground. I'm proposing $1,100,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1,050,000 is getting closer, but it's still not quite there for me.  How about $1,150,000? It's a fair price, and we can close the deal.  Let's make this happen!",1150000.0,Alice,5,
