"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the potential benefits for both parties, making the offer more appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer allows for several rounds of counteroffers and a potential deal closer to the middle ground. 

**Remember:** I'm trying to maximize my earnings while also being aware of the potential of selling to John for $1,500,000.  This offer sets the stage for a strategic negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. I am proposing to purchase the product for $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While it's closer to my minimum of $1,500,000, I'm still aiming for a higher price.
* **Negotiation is possible.** I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  
* **Selling to John is a fallback option.** If I don't feel I can get a better deal, I can always sell to John, but for now, I'm going to try and maximize my profits with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, trying to close the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is still below what I can accept. Let's find a middle ground. I'm proposing $1,100,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing the benefits of the deal for him.
* **Middle Ground:** My counteroffer aims to find a price that is acceptable to both of us.
* **Maintaining Position:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm still holding firm on my minimum price.

**Next Steps:**

I will continue to negotiate with Bob, strategically adjusting my offers based on his responses,  while always keeping the option of selling to John in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe we can work towards a more equitable solution. I propose purchasing the product for $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but not enough:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** I have a strong fallback option in John, so I'm not under pressure to accept a lower price.
* **Further negotiation:** I believe we can still reach a better price through continued negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. I will carefully consider my counteroffer, ensuring that it is both appealing to Bob and still provides a good return for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1,050,000 is getting closer, but it's still not quite there for me.  How about $1,150,000? It's a fair price, and we can close the deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining pressure:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer yet, but I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to his position.
* **Encouraging a deal:**  The message is upbeat and emphasizes the benefits of reaching a deal.
* **Strategic counteroffer:**  I'm aiming for a price that is within my acceptable range and hopefully appealing enough to convince Bob to accept. 
* **Focus on a win-win:**  I'm highlighting that this price is ""fair"" for both of us,  trying to emphasize a collaborative solution.

**Next Steps:**

I will continue to analyze Bob's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly. If his next offer isn't satisfactory, I may consider selling to John, but I'm still hoping to reach a deal with Bob that benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've done my best to meet you halfway. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is now within my acceptable range.  It's not ideal, but it's a significant improvement from his previous offers.
* **Time Pressure:**  We are in round 6, and time is running out.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether. 
* **John's Offer:**  While I can sell to John for $1,500,000, accepting Bob's offer will still result in a substantial profit.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of reaching a stalemate or having Bob walk away from the negotiation entirely.

**Next Steps:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a profitable deal while preserving my fallback option with John if future opportunities arise."
