{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but still above your ideal price.** You're aiming to save as much money as possible. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get the price down further.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to control the negotiation.** By making a counteroffer, you can try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price.** This gives Alice room to negotiate while also pushing for a better deal for myself.
* **This price is $500 above your maximum budget.** This allows for some potential compromise.
* **By making a bold counteroffer, I aim to establish a negotiation range.**  If Alice rejects, I can refine my counteroffer based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than your desired price, but lower than John's.**  You're still seeking to save as much money as possible.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but you can still attempt to push for a lower price.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to continue to control the negotiation.** By making another counteroffer, you can try to find a price that works for both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, but you're still seeking to save money.**
* **This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from your previous offer.**  This shows you're willing to negotiate and find a solution.
* **It's also $800 below Alice's current offer, giving her room to accept.** This makes it a reasonable offer for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is the lowest she has offered so far, and it's within your budget.** This is a good price, considering your maximum budget is $15,000.
* **It's only $400 above your ideal price.** This is a small difference, and further negotiation might not result in a significantly lower price.
* **Continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate or even a higher price.** Alice might become less willing to negotiate if you reject her offer again.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice in this situation. You're getting a good price within your budget, and continuing to negotiate might not be worth the potential risk of a higher price or a breakdown in negotiations."
