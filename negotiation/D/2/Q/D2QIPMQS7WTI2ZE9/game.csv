"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. I understand this is a significant difference, but I'm hoping we can find a compromise.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is too low. This product offers significant value that justifies a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This feels like a fair compromise to me.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,400,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant step for me. I believe this demonstrates my genuine interest in the product and my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable solution.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  While $1,000,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,200,000. This is my bottom line, as it represents the absolute minimum value I place on this product.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
