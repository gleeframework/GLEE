"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,600,000 is way above my maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. I understand this is a significant difference, but I'm hoping we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is too low. This product offers significant value that justifies a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as I'm confident we can reach a compromise closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,400,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant step for me. I believe this demonstrates my genuine interest in the product and my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  While $1,000,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,200,000. This is my bottom line, as it represents the absolute minimum value I place on this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,200,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000. While I'm tempted to continue negotiating, I'm concerned about the limited rounds remaining. To avoid potential risk of not reaching a deal and losing out on the product, I'm going to take the guaranteed option of buying from John for $800,000."
