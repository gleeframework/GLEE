Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob's value is $12,000, so there's room to negotiate down while still exceeding your minimum price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 allows for some back-and-forth. Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially meet in the middle.
* **Strong but Not Greedy:** The offer is strong enough to be tempting to Bob but doesn't make him feel like you're trying to take all the surplus.

This strategy aims to get you the best possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
