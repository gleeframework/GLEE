**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $14,000, while John is selling it for $15,000.
* **You are still getting a good deal:**  Although the product is worth $15,000 to you, you can get it for less from Alice. This means you are saving $1,000 compared to buying from John."
