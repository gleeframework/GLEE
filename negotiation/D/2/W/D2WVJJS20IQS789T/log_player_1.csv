Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it will be incredibly valuable to you. My asking price is $1,300,000. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $1,300,000 is higher than Bob's $1,000,000 valuation, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $1,300,000 is below your minimum of $1,500,000, giving you some leeway to negotiate down.
* **It's positive and open:** The message emphasizes the value for Bob and leaves the door open for a discussion. 

This initial offer sets the stage for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for such a drastic reduction.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  While I'm open to negotiation, I can't go that far below my initial price.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves you a significant profit margin, and it's closer to my valuation of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:**  $1,100,000 is significantly higher than Bob's offer of $800,000.
* **It's lower than my initial offer:**  $1,100,000 is lower than my initial offer of $1,300,000, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still above my minimum:**  $1,100,000 is above my minimum of $1,500,000, so I'm still not selling at a loss. 
* **It's framed positively:**  The message highlights the potential profit for Bob and emphasizes finding a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has moved closer to my price, his offer of $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've already made a significant concession.  There is a considerable gap between our valuations, and it seems unlikely that further negotiation will bridge that gap.   Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000 to ensure I get the value I need."
