"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it will be incredibly valuable to you. My asking price is $1,300,000. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  While I'm open to negotiation, I can't go that far below my initial price.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves you a significant profit margin, and it's closer to my valuation of the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering my budget constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,
