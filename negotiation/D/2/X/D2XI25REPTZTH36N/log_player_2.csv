It's not worth it to buy the product from Alice at $10,000.  You can get it for $8,000 from John, so rejecting the offer is the logical first step."

I'm offering Alice the minimum I'm willing to pay for the product, hoping she'll accept.  If not, I'll go with John."

Alice is still too high.  It's better to go with John and get the product for $8,000."
