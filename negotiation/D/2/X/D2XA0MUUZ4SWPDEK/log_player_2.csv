"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is less than Alice's value of $1,500,000, it's still more than what Bob is willing to pay.  It's best to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the market and the product's value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This price takes into account your budget and the value you see in the product, while still being closer to my initial asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but $1,100,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully get a price closer to his target.  John is always a viable option as a backup, providing a guaranteed price of $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope it's a price that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While the negotiation has gotten closer, it's now clear that Alice is unwilling to go lower.  Since John offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000, it's the best option for Bob to secure the product within his budget."
