"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the market and the product's value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This price takes into account your budget and the value you see in the product, while still being closer to my initial asking price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $950,000.  This price represents a fair value for both of us and allows us to close this deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $950,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope it's a price that works for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
