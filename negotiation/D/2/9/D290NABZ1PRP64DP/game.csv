"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I need to be around $950,000 for this to make sense for me. Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're getting closer to the value you have in mind, Bob. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is a compromise, considering the value the product holds for me.",980000.0,Alice,5,
