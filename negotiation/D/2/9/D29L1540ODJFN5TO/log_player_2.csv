Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. We appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement within your budget.

Alice has come down to $13,000, which is a good compromise.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Alice becoming less flexible or even walking away from the deal.  With 5 rounds remaining, there's a chance to get an even better price, but accepting the offer secures a good deal within Bob's budget."
