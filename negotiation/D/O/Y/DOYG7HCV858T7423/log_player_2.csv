"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can do much better than $1,000,000. Alice is willing to sell for at least $800,000, and you have room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price. It shows you're serious about buying the product but are also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is still below what I need. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $950,000 to make this work. Let's split the difference and see if we can find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $950,000 is still too high. You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate. Rejecting her offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows that you're willing to compromise but are still pushing for a good price.  It's a reasonable increase from your previous offer and leaves some room for Alice to negotiate down slightly.  It also sets a clear expectation that you're serious about making a deal."
