"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is still below what I need. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $950,000 to make this work. Let's split the difference and see if we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",900000.0,Bob,4,
