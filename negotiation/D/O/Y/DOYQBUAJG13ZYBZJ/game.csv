"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm on a tight budget and I'm not willing to pay $20,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",14000.0,Bob,4,
