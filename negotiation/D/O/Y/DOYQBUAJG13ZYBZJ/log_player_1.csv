Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?

Bob's offer:

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's still below what John is willing to pay. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
