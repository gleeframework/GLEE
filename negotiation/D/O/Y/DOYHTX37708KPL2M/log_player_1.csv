Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $145 is above your minimum of $120, so you're already making a profit. 
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $145 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($150), giving him an incentive to buy.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for back and forth if Bob wants to counteroffer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  That's a little steep for me right now. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is more than my minimum, it's significantly lower than what I'd like to get.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth more to you. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  While it's a nice product, $130 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $120? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum price, and it's a fair compromise.  I'll accept his offer."
