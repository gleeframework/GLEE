"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your offer. However, I have to consider my minimum price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $950,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $900,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it if we can find a fair agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $925,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is already a significant discount from my initial offer, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",925000.0,Alice,5,
