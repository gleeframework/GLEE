"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a fair price given its value.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it agreeable.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",10500.0,Bob,6,
