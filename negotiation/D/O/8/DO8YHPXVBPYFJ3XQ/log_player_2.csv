"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and significance, I am offering it to you for $15,000. This price reflects not only the product's worth but also the opportunity to secure such an exceptional item at a premium rate. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is too high, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John.  It makes sense to counteroffer Alice first, as he may be able to get a better deal than from John."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,000 is lower than the original price, it's still higher than what he can get from John. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if she'll come down further."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is closer to his desired price, it's still higher than what he can get from John.
