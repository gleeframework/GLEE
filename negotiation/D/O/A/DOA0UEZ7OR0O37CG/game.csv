"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for this product. It's a fair price, considering I'm willing to buy it from you directly. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob, but $12,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is a fair price that I think we can both agree on. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair compromise.  If we can reach an agreement at this price, I'm ready to make the purchase today.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $17,000? This is a bit above your offer, but I'm confident it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,
