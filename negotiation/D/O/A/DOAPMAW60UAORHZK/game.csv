"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider something closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I can meet you in the middle at $900,000, but that's as low as I can go.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $700,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but $700,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I can do $850,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",850000.0,Alice,5,
