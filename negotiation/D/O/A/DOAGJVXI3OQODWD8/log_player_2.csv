"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, Bob. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You value the product at $150 and Alice is offering it for $120.  While this is a good deal, you can get it for $150 from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll still get the product but at a price closer to your value."
