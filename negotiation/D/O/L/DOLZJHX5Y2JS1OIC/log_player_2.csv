"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I believe its value to you would be even greater.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her own valuation, but still above my maximum budget.  I can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $950,000 is a good starting point, it doesn't quite meet my needs.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This ensures a fair deal for both of us and allows us to move forward. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my desired price point, but closer to my budget. I'm going to try to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective. $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still not there yet. How about $1,000,000?  This price is fair for both of us - I get the product within my budget, and you get a quick sale at your minimum price. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
