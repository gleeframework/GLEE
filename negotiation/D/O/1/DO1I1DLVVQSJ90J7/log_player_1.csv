"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 matches John's standing offer, there's no guarantee that Bob won't lower his offer in subsequent rounds. Accepting his offer now carries the risk of potentially losing out on a higher price, especially since we're only in Round 2.  

Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price for the product. It's always possible to get a better deal, but in this case, securing the known value outweighs the potential (and uncertain) upside with Bob."
