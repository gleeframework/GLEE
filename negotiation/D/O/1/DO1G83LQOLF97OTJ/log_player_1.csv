"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a strong starting point, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more. It's also high enough that I can afford to lower the price a bit if needed before resorting to selling to John for the minimum $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is better than the minimum $12,000, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I'm confident that I can get a higher offer from Bob or at least improve my position for future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $14,500. This is a compromise that meets Bob halfway, showing that I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price than his initial offer. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing offer to him while also leaving room for further bargaining if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $13,500. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. We're getting closer to a deal, and I'm confident that I can either get a better offer from Bob in the next round or get closer to my goal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise that further meets Bob halfway, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping that this offer will be attractive to him, and we can close the deal in this round. If he rejects, I'm prepared to go further, but I'm confident this is a good offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a further compromise to meet Bob halfway and hopefully secure a deal in this round.  I'm aware that we're running out of time, but I'm still confident that I can get a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $12,500. While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum, and we are getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  I'm taking the risk of missing out on a potentially higher offer from Bob in the future rounds, but with only two rounds left, I'm choosing to secure this deal. It's important to balance ambition with practicality, especially when time is a factor."
