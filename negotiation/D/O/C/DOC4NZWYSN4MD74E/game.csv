"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,080,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if that's something you'd be comfortable with.",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit above my target, but I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",1060000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,060,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,060,000 and my initial offer of $1,100,000. How about $1,080,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
