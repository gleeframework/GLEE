"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll get a great value out of it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You can likely negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can secure a deal closer to your target price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,080,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if that's something you'd be comfortable with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your target price, but it's still above your ideal range.  You have a good chance of negotiating further down.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer again and potentially secure a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,060,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,060,000 and my initial offer of $1,100,000. How about $1,080,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already rejected your final offer of $1,060,000 and is holding firm at $1,080,000.  At this point, it's better to cut your losses and purchase the product from John for $1,000,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of going back and forth without reaching a satisfactory price, and you could end up losing out on the deal altogether.  It's more advantageous to secure the product at your maximum budget from a reliable seller like John."
