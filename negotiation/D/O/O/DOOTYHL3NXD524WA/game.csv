"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,400,000. It's a steal for a product worth $1,200,000 to you.  Let's make this deal happen!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 just isn't feasible for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to my bottom line.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,250,000, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. I'm willing to offer you $1,150,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to both parties.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise that considers both our perspectives.  Let's make this deal happen.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! While $1,225,000 is a good offer, I'm hoping to land right at $1,200,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to get a good sale. Let's close this deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
