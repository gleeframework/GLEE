"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

This initial offer is ambitious, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves a fair amount of room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal, given the product is worth $10,000 to him."
