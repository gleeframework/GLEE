Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to meet you at $78, Bob. I'm still a bit above my minimum price, and I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to offer it to you for $79.50. It's a small concession, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $79.50.  You've negotiated her down significantly, and it's a reasonable price compared to your $100 alternative.  Continuing to negotiate might irritate her and risk losing the deal."
