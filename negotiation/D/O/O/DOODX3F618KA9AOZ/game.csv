"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a good middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concern about the price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
