Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He values the product at $8,000, so $12,000 gives him some room to negotiate without feeling like he's overpaying.
* **It's below your minimum value:** You value the product at $15,000, so you have a cushion to potentially lower the price if needed.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  The message emphasizes your willingness to work with Bob, potentially leading to a faster agreement.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's negotiation style:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might consider a higher initial offer. 
* **Time sensitivity:** If you need to sell the product quickly, you might be more willing to accept a lower price.
* **John's offer:**  Remember that John is a backup option for $15,000.  If negotiations with Bob stall, you can always fall back to John."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am interested in purchasing the product, but I can only pay $9,000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I hope you'll find it acceptable. Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position and I'm willing to consider $10,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Although $10,000 is still lower than my desired price, it's getting closer to my minimum value of $15,000. It's also a fair compromise considering Bob's initial offer of $9,000. Accepting this offer will allow me to sell the product without losing too much and avoid the risk of further negotiation, which could lead to a lower price or even a failed sale."
