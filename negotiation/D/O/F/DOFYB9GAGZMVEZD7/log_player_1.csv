Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially earn more than John's offer.  I'll be watching for Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.  I want to see if there's more room for negotiation before I consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still staying above John's offer.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and will be willing to come closer to my price.  I'm also keeping in mind that we can continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, but I'm starting to see that he's willing to negotiate. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer. I'm hopeful that we can reach a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price and John's offer.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a sign of good faith and be willing to meet me halfway.  I'm also keeping in mind that we can continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I've gone through several rounds of negotiation and it seems like we're not going to reach an agreement. I don't want to risk continuing this back-and-forth and potentially ending up with a lower offer.  John offers a guaranteed price that's above my minimum, so I'll take his offer."
