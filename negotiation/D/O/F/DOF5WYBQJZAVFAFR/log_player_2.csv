Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $11,500 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000.

This is a good deal for Bob.  He can get the product for $12,800, which is less than the $15,000 he would pay John. Although Bob could potentially negotiate further, it's unlikely he will get a significantly better offer. There is a risk that if he rejects Alice's offer, she might not make another one, and he would be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
