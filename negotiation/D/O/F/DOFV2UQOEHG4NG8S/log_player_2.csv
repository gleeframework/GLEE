{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, there's potential to negotiate further and save even more money.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  He's starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong negotiating position.  He's aiming to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and see if she'll come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $600,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly to $650,000. This shows Alice that he's willing to compromise, but still wants a better price than her last offer. It's a move that aims to find a middle ground and hopefully secure a deal close to his desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob could continue negotiating, Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  Accepting the $725,000 offer secures a good deal for Bob, saving him a substantial amount of money compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might yield a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob missing out on a good deal outweighs the potential savings."
