"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal for a product that's worth a lot more to me. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to make this work.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a budget in mind. Could we agree on $95? It's a significant jump from my last offer and would save me buying elsewhere.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $95 is simply not enough for me.  Let's split the difference - $110. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your compromise is appreciated.  How about we settle at $100?  It's a round number and keeps me within my budget.",100.0,Bob,6,
