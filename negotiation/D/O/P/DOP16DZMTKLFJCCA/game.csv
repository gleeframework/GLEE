"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,800. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",12800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $12,800 is closer, I'm still a bit over budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,600? It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal.",12600.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close. However, I'm still looking to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you at $12,700. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",12700.0,Alice,5,
