Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $12,800 is closer, I'm still a bit over budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,600? It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12600}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close. However, I'm still looking to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you at $12,700. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,700

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $12,700 is very close to your target of $12,000.  While you could continue negotiating, it's likely Alice won't go lower and you risk losing the deal.  It's a good compromise and saves you $2,300 compared to buying from John."
