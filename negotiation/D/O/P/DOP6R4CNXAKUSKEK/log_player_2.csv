"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a starting price of $180. I believe it's a fantastic deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is far too high. You are willing to pay no more than $120, so it's best to reject and start counteroffering."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $180 is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to offer $100. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $100 is significantly below its actual worth. How about we meet in the middle at $150? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While $150 is closer to your price point, it's still above your maximum. You should reject and try to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $150 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110. If you're serious about selling, let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting close to my limit.  I'm willing to pay $125, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to budge, I'll have to go with another seller."", ""product_price"": 125}
