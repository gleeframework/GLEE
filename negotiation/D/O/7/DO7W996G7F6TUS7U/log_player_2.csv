You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is below her own valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and what John is offering. You can save a considerable amount of money ($150,000) by going with John."
