Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I think we're really close now. I can see you're willing to meet me at $8,500, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $9,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

It's time to cut bait and go with John. Alice seems unlikely to budge below $9,000, and you have a guaranteed option at $8,000.  There's no point risking a worse deal by continuing to negotiate."
