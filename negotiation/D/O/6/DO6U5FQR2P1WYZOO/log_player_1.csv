I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000, leaving room for negotiation.  I believe this is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my initial offer.  I'm confident I can get closer to $2,000,000."

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my original offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains a good profit margin for me."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still hopeful I can get a higher price.  I'm going to make one more counteroffer to try to reach a compromise."

```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While I wanted to get closer to my initial goal, it's clear that Bob is not willing to pay significantly more than his current offer. It's better to secure a sale at my minimum value than to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with an even lower price."
