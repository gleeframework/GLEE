Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think it would be very valuable to you!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still exceeding your minimum price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, while still guaranteeing a profit if he accepts outright.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $120 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing money."
