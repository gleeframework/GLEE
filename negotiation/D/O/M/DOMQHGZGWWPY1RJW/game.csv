"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider this offer?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $175 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $155. It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product, but also shows I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.",155.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $155 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is still a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $140. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",140.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your last concession, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $140. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",125.0,Bob,6,
