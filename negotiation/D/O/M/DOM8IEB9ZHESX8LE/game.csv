"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm confident it will be a great fit for you. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $18,000. This is a great value, considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. I'm willing to make a concession, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
