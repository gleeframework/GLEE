"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I see value in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but the gap is still a bit wide for me.  How about $725,000?  That feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $775,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not willing to accept $750,000. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000, as I mentioned earlier.
