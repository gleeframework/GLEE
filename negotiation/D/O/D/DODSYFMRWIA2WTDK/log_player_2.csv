# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a competitive price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget and above John's offer. It makes more sense to buy from John for $8,000."
