"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its worth to me. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and allows for a fair deal for both of us. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that works for everyone.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875000. I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
