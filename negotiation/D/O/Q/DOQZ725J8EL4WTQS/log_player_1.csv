"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since I can get $12,000 from John, Bob's offer of $10,500 is too low. I should try to negotiate a better price.
