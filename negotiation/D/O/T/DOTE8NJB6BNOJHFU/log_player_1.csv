"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?

Round 3

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to John's offer, but it seems like Bob might be willing to go a bit higher. It's worth risking one more counteroffer to try and secure a slightly better deal."

Round 7

{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is very slowly incrementing his offers. It's unlikely he'll reach a number significantly closer to $1,200,000 in the remaining rounds.  At this point, the difference in potential profit isn't worth the risk of Bob not increasing his offer enough. Accepting John's offer guarantees the full $1,200,000."
