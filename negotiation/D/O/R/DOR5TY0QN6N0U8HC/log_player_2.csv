"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $15000. It's a real steal, considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, there's no reason to jump at it immediately. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There's a chance she might be willing to come down, especially since you have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13500?  That seems like a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price. While you could continue negotiating,  $13,500 is a good compromise and still leaves you with some room for savings compared to John's price."
