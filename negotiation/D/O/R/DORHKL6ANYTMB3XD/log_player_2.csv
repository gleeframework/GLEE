"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you this great product for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject the offer.  Here's why:

* **Your Limit:** You're willing to pay up to $120.
* **Alice's Offer:** $110
* **John's Offer:** $120

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know John will sell it to you for $120. There's a chance Alice might come down in price, saving you even more money."
