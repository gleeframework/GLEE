"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest!  While $150 is my minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $175.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $160 is still a bit too low for me. How about $165?  That's a good compromise and I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the price.  Let me know your thoughts.",165.0,Alice,5,
