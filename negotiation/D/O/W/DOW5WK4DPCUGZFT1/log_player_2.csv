(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  There's a good chance you can get a lower price by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see how much wiggle room Alice has.  $700,000 is a good starting point to see if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $850,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to see if I can get a better price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm serious about buying, but I'm still trying to stay below her last offer. Hopefully, this will lead to a quick agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down in price, and we're getting closer to a deal.  $825,000 is a good price, and it's getting late in the negotiation. It's worth accepting to avoid further haggling and potential risk of going over my $1,200,000 limit if I keep negotiating."
