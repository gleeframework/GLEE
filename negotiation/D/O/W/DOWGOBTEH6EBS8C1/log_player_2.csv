"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is close to my maximum price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll see if I can get it for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. This way, I can gauge her willingness to come down on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but I think I can still get it lower.  I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice, but I was hoping for something a little closer to $115. Would that be possible?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

I'm inching closer to a price I'd be willing to accept, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I want to see if Alice is willing to meet me near the middle ground between our last two offers."
