"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
