Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. This is a great deal, as it's significantly lower than its true value.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $11,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate, while still ensuring I get a decent profit.
* **Message:** A friendly and encouraging message helps to build rapport and motivates Bob to consider my offer. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a negotiation that allows me to earn as much money as possible while still maximizing the chance of a successful sale. By setting a slightly higher initial price, I create space for negotiation and have the opportunity to potentially earn closer to my desired $12,000. However, I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me.
*  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go that low.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a compromise that is mutually acceptable. However, if he continues to be unwilling to budge, I will ultimately sell to John to ensure I receive at least my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing $10,000, which is halfway between my initial offer ($11,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a decent profit margin.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating my previous message about the value of the product, but now I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of my counteroffer to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

My aim is to reach a compromise that works for both of us. By proposing a middle ground, I demonstrate that I'm serious about negotiating, but I also make it clear that I'm not willing to significantly undervalue my product.  If Bob still refuses, I'll likely accept John's offer to ensure I get my minimum value."
