Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in your product but I'm only willing to pay $12000.  Let me know what you think.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $15,000 to make this deal work.  It's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

Bob's offer of $13,500 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and closer to my desired price than my previous counteroffer. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and maximizes profit without risking further negotiation."
