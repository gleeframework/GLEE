Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than what John is willing to pay, but still leaves some room for negotiation with Bob.  Let's see if we can get closer to that $1,500,000 mark!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's more than John's offer, it's still significantly below what I'm aiming for.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but I'm still holding firm.  $1,300,000 is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see it that way."
