"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a unique opportunity with immense potential. I'm confident you'll see its value. My asking price is $1500000. I'm open to discussion, but I'm certain this is a fair price considering the product's worth.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1300000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $1400000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1300000 and $1400000, so I'd like to propose a price of $1350000. Can we discuss this further?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
