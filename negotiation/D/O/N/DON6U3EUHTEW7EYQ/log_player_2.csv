# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a unique opportunity with immense potential. I'm confident you'll see its value. My asking price is $1500000. I'm open to discussion, but I'm certain this is a fair price considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1300000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $1400000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.
