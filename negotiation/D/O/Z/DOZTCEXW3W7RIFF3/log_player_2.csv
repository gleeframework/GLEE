"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think?

* **Limited time:** This is round 9, leaving only one round before you have to resort to John's much higher offer.
* **Alice is firm:** Alice has repeatedly stated her minimum price, suggesting further negotiation might be futile.

**Conclusion:**

Given the limited time and Alice's reluctance to go lower, accepting her offer at $11,050 is the most strategic choice. It allows you to secure the product at a price that's reasonable, considering the alternative."
