"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
