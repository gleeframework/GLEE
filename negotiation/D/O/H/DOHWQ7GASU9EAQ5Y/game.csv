"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,600,000? This reflects the product's worth while still leaving room for us to negotiate.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However, $1,600,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is closer to a fair price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems we're getting closer. While $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000 to try and close this deal. What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  $1,100,000 is a tempting offer, but I need to be firm on this. My final offer is $1,225,000.  This is a compromise that reflects the true value of the product.  Let me know your decision.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
