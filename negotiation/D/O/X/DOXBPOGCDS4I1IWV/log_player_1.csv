``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above your minimum price of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message that might encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'd prefer to continue negotiating with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,500 is still a bit lower than what I need.  How about we settle at $8,250? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8250}
