"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! However, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? I believe that's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is just too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'll accept $8,500.  It's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $7,000, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",8000.0,Bob,4,
