"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not giving away the product for less than it's worth to you.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  He still sees value in buying the product at this price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This creates the potential for a win-win scenario. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're providing. However, I can only commit to a maximum of $13000 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a decent price, it's still below my desired target.  I have 8 rounds left and can potentially secure a higher price through further negotiation.  Selling to John right now would be a loss, as I could get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $13,500.  This still allows you to get a good deal while ensuring I get a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose an offer of $13200. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,200 is close to my desired price point. While I could try for a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  With 6 rounds remaining, there's a chance I might not be able to secure a better offer.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a good profit, and it's a good outcome for both of us."
