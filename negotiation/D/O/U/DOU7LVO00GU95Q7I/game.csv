"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  How about $90?  I'm sure we can find a price we're both happy with.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking for a price that's closer to the value I think the product holds. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair compromise.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $105.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $115. I think it's a unique item that's worth that much to the right buyer. How about we meet again in the middle at $112.50? It's a small increase from your offer, but I think it's still a fair price.",112.5,Alice,5,
