Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common strategy in negotiation to leave room for compromise.  I'm also taking into account my minimum acceptable price of $150, and John's willingness to pay that amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. However, it's closer to my desired price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer to $155. This is still lower than my initial offer, but it's above my minimum acceptable price and closer to my desired price. It's a compromise, but it leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $145 is tempting and closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm confident that John will buy the product for $150, so I'll go with the guaranteed deal."
