"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,400,000 was a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
