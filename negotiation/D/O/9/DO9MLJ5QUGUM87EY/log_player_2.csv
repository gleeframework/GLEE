**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer of $60, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $75.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $95 is getting very close to my maximum price of $100.
* With only 3 rounds remaining, I'm unlikely to get a better price from Alice, especially if she's already rejected my offer of $80.
* It's safer and more efficient to buy the product from John at $100. This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice that might not result in a better price."
