Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this incredible product. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly holding firm, and this offer is close enough to my ideal price. It's better to secure the deal at $1,050,000 than risk the negotiation breaking down and having to buy from John for $1,500,000."
