"I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd be willing to pay $75 for it.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $75 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $85?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $85 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd be willing to pay $78 for it. I'm trying to stay within my budget.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $82 for the product. That's a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to finalize the deal this round!",82.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $82 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd be willing to pay $79 for it. I'm getting close to my budget, and I'd like to make a deal.",79.0,Bob,6,
