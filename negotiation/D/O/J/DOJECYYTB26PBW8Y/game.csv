"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the original price I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $15000? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal on this amazing product.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $15000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but that's my maximum. Can you consider that?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go below $16000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though.

"I understand you're really close to your budget limit, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go below $16000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though.

"I'm really trying to be reasonable here, Alice, but I just can't go above $13000. I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. Can you really only sell this product for $10000 to John, but not to me?",13000.0,Bob,8,
