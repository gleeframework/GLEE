Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I'm interested in purchasing your product for $10,000. Let me know if this is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'd like to close the deal, his offer is too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $10,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10750}

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to land somewhere in the middle."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $10,600. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's fair given the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10600}

I'll reject Bob's offer. I'm getting closer to my desired price, but $10,550 is still too low. I believe I can get a better deal with a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my position. I am willing to pay $10,560 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,560. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,560
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We're very close to my desired price, and I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting, I might lose the deal altogether.  $10,560 is a decent amount, and it's better than selling to John for $12,000.  I'll take the deal and move on."
