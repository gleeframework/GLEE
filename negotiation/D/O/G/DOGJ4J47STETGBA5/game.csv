"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my own valuation and the value it holds for you. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,100,000 is still outside my price range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's find a way to make this work.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for both of us. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  $925,000 is still a little out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that we've both shown a willingness to compromise. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,8,
