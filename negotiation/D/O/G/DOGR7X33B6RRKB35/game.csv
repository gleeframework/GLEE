"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about we consider $750,000 for the product?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a solid outcome.  What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I understand your position, but unfortunately, $825,000 is still out of my budget. Could we meet somewhere closer to $780,000? I believe that would be a fair compromise.",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your persistence. While $780,000 is closer to where I need to be, it's still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference.  How about $800,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal.  What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
