"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Considering the value to me and the potential for us both to benefit from this deal, I'm offering $900,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both parties. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the value of the product to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,000,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price that's closer to my budget and still allows you to make a decent profit.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $950,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you is $800,000. What are your thoughts?",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further, but $980,000 is still a little outside my budget.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $965,000.  This allows us both to walk away with a good deal, and I'm confident we can finalize this agreement.",965000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you is $800,000. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",975000.0,Alice,7,
