"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. While her offer is lower than John's, there's still room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you and the market demand. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is still a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your offer and potentially leading to a higher price from her or forcing you to buy from John outweighs the potential savings."
