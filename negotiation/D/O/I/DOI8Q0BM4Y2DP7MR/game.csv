"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it aligns perfectly with your needs.  I'm confident it will be worth every penny. My initial offer is $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $900,000 is below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down slightly. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering $1,050,000.  This reflects the unique value of this product and gives us both a fair deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $925,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $925,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth.  To be fair to both of us, let's split the difference again. I'm offering $1,000,000 - my minimum acceptable price, and still a great deal for a product that delivers significant value.  It's a win-win for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get back to your original price, but I'm not willing to pay that. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but no more. I believe that's a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,6,
