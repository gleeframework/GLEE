"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, we value it at $1,500,000. Starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and helps us understand Bob's upper limit.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting with a high number, we anchor the negotiation in our favor. Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, his counteroffers will likely be higher than if we started lower. 
* **Confidence:** The message projects confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception.

This strategy gives us the best chance to maximize profit while leaving room to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above his perceived value of the product, indicating there's room for further negotiation. While accepting would secure a profit, we can likely push for a better deal in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees our minimum, but we might be able to get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for presenting yours. I'm confident in the significant value this product holds and believe it's worth more than your current offer reflects. To meet you halfway, I propose a price of $1,750,000."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** By suggesting a price exactly between our previous offer ($2,000,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($1,200,000), we demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  We reiterate the product's value without directly dismissing Bob's offer. This keeps the tone positive and reinforces the product's worth in Bob's mind.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation active and allows us to gauge Bob's flexibility. We are still in a strong position to accept John's offer if needed, but maximizing profit with Bob remains the priority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However,  $1,750,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000.  I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer, but Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is still significantly below our desired outcome and what John is offering. While there's a risk that Bob might walk away, we'll try to guide him towards a more favorable price point in the next round. We have some leverage knowing he is willing to go above his perceived value, indicating the product's importance to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the value this product offers.  To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We are making a smaller concession this round ($150,000 instead of $250,000), signaling that we're reaching our limit while still acknowledging Bob's efforts.
* **Final Offer Tactic:** Introducing a ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and can potentially push Bob to accept or counter with a more serious offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The $1,600,000 price point still provides a substantial profit margin above our minimum and John's offer, allowing us to walk away if necessary. 

This strategy aims to either close the deal at a favorable price or gain a clearer understanding of Bob's absolute limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. However, to be honest, $1,600,000 is still pushing my budget to the limit. I'm willing to offer $1,450,000 as a final attempt to reach a deal. If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options for this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has presented his ""final offer"" of $1,450,000.  While this is a significant amount, it's still below our guaranteed offer from John ($1,500,000). 

Here's why selling to John makes the most sense now:

* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John's offer guarantees our minimum acceptable profit, eliminating further risk or uncertainty.
* **Bob's Limit:**  Bob explicitly stated his budget constraints and presented his ""final attempt.""  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to our desired price.
* **Time Value:** Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of a stalemate, potentially leading to a missed opportunity with John. 

Although we might be able to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's not worth risking the sure thing we have with John."
