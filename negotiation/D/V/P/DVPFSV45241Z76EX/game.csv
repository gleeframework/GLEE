"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for presenting yours. I'm confident in the significant value this product holds and believe it's worth more than your current offer reflects. To meet you halfway, I propose a price of $1,750,000.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However,  $1,750,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000.  I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the product's value to me.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the value this product offers.  To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. However, to be honest, $1,600,000 is still pushing my budget to the limit. I'm willing to offer $1,450,000 as a final attempt to reach a deal. If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options for this purchase.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
