"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is a good price, it's worth seeing if you can get it lower.  There's no harm in rejecting and making a counteroffer. You can potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $70. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation. My goal is to get as close to my maximum price of $100 as possible, while also being realistic about what Alice might accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $75, which is a good price considering my maximum budget is $100. While I could try for a lower price, there's a risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and me having to buy from John at $100.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price within my budget."
