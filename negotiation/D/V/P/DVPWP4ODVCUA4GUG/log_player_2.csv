"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You can potentially get the product for a lower price than $1,400,000 by continuing to negotiate with Alice. While $1,400,000 is within your budget, it's still more than Alice's minimum desired price of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer and see if you can reach a more favorable price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is within your budget and is a better price than what John is offering. While you could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject your next counteroffer and you'll end up paying more or having to buy from John. It's a good deal considering the price you're willing to pay and the potential for a higher price if you continue negotiations."
