Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I believe a price of $11,000 is fair considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 gives us leverage. We are not desperate to sell below that price.

This strategy aims for a high initial offer while still being reasonable enough for Bob to accept."
