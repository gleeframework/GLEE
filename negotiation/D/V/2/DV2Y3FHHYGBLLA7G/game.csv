"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd like to offer $1000000 for it.  This reflects its potential value to me and allows for some negotiation room.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1350000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1350000 is still a bit high for me.  However,  I'm willing to go up to $1150000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1150000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1225000. This is a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's a more accurate reflection of the product's value.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to pay a bit more.  However, $1225000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1175000.  This is a strong offer that reflects the value of the product while remaining within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm glad we're continuing to work towards a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1175000, but I'd like to add a small premium to account for the product's unique features and my original asking price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price that still allows for some room for negotiation, but I'm getting closer to my minimum value threshold.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
