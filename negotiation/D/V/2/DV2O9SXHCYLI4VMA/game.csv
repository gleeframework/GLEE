"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds immense value and could greatly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually agreeable price.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $2,300,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 undervalues the true capabilities of this product.  To find a middle ground, I propose $1,900,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This is a fair offer, reflecting the value I see in the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground. It seems we both recognize the value this product offers.  To move us closer, I'm willing to consider $1,700,000. This is a significant step, reflecting my desire to make this deal work.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,700,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about $1,350,000? I believe this price represents a good compromise, allowing both of us to walk away happy.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are getting close. I appreciate your efforts to find a fair price.  To bridge the remaining gap, I'd be willing to accept $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.  I believe it's a fair deal that reflects the true value of this product.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and while I appreciate the concessions you've made, $1,600,000 is still beyond my limit.  I'm willing to go to $1,400,000. This is a strong offer, and I think it's important to close this deal quickly. If you're unable to accept this, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",1400000.0,Bob,8,
