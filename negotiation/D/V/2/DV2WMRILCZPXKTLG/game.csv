"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $95 right now.  What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a little too high at $110. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I'm really hoping to make this work.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $105. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $107. It's a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",107.0,Alice,5,
