"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good deal, it's still above your desired price point. You have 10 rounds to negotiate and can potentially secure a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and explore a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point, but $950,000 is still above your ideal range. You have more rounds to negotiate and can likely secure an even better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to counter again and potentially close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $925,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $937,500.  This is a fair price that allows for a smooth transaction. Let's seal the deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $937,500, which is close to your desired price point and a good deal considering the limited rounds left.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might not budge or even increase the price.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer, and you still have some wiggle room within your budget."
