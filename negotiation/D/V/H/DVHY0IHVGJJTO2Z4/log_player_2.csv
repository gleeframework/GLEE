"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far above your budget and what you know the product is worth from John. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $80."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Polite and respectful:** Maintains a good negotiating relationship with Alice.
* **Signals interest:** Shows you're serious about buying but not at any cost.
* **Anchors low:** Starts the negotiation significantly below your actual maximum price, leaving room to bargain upward while still staying well below Alice's starting point and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is coming down in price, $120 is still more than you need to pay. There's room for further negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we settle on $95? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

Here's why this is a good move:

* **Continuing the dance:**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, so there's no need to jump to John just yet.
* **Upward movement:**  Showing you're willing to increase your offer keeps the negotiation moving. 
* **Strategic positioning:** $95 puts you within striking distance of a price that works for you while staying below John's offer. It also gives Alice some room to potentially counter a little lower."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit above $95, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my costs. How about we meet at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is very unlikely to go lower than $105. You've successfully negotiated her down, but it's time to cut your losses. John's offer of $100 is now the better deal, saving you $5."
