Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point as it's more than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be willing to pay this price, as it's still lower than the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's more than my minimum value, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm countering with a price of $100. This is still lower than Bob's perceived value, but closer to my desired price point.  I hope this will encourage Bob to come closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's only slightly higher than what I'd get from John, it's still above my minimum value.  Continuing to negotiate might risk Bob walking away and leaving me with only John's offer.  It's better to secure the sale now."
