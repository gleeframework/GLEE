"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is above that. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that Bob is serious about buying the product but is not willing to pay an unreasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above Bob's maximum. He can try to negotiate further and see if he can get closer to his target price of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

This counteroffer is a slight increase from the previous offer, showing willingness to compromise but still staying within Bob's maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget, but it is getting closer. Bob should continue negotiating and see if he can get a price he's comfortable with.  It's worth risking another round of negotiation, as the difference between Alice's offer and John's price is not significant."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Bob is now offering Alice's minimum acceptable price. This is a final offer, and if Alice rejects, Bob will buy from John."
