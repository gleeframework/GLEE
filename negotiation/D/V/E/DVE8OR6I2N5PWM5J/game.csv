"Bob, I've made a significant concession already, and I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to give you a small discount to sweeten the deal. I'll sell the product to you for $1325000, but I'll throw in a special bonus that's worth $25000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,7,
