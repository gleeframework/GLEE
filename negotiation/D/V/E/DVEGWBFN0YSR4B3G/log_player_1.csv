# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for the product.

I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for this product.  This is still a very good deal for you, as you'll be getting a valuable product for significantly less than its true worth to you.
