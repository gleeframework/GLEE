""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $500,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. We have plenty of room to negotiate and John provides a good fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $500,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair offer, considering its potential return on investment."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,400,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I could potentially stretch to $700,000. If that's not workable, we might need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product.  While his offer is increasing, we can likely get him higher or utilize our guaranteed sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,100,000?"",

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer.  That said, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  To make this work, I'd need to be closer to $800,000.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

We're getting close, but we're still leaving money on the table. Bob is clearly interested and moving upwards. We can afford to push him a little further before resorting to John."
