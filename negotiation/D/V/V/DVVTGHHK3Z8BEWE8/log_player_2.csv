"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's a negotiation tactic to start with a significantly lower offer than your actual budget. This gives you room to negotiate upwards and still potentially secure a deal below your maximum price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $6,000 leaves a significant gap between your offer and Alice's initial asking price. This signals your willingness to negotiate but also sets a low anchor point for the discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. I could come down to $17,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice lowered her price, $17,000 is still significantly higher than your $8,000 budget and John's guaranteed offer. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice using the phrase ""final offer"" at this stage is likely a negotiation tactic. It's early in the process, and there's still room for negotiation.

We need to show Alice we're serious but also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product has value, but $17,000 is more than I'm prepared to spend. I can offer $7,000, and that's pushing my budget. If we can't agree on something closer to that, I might have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Offer, But With Conditions:** By increasing the offer to $7,000, we signal to Alice that we're serious about buying but are firm on our budget limitations. 
* **Introducing Alternatives:** Mentioning ""other options"" (John's offer) subtly reminds Alice that she's not our only option.
* **Firm but Respectful:** The message remains respectful while clearly communicating your position and the potential consequences of not reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear your concerns about the budget, but I need to be closer to the product's real value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  This is a significant price drop, and I'm hoping we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Although Alice significantly lowered her price, $14,000 remains considerably above your $8,000 limit.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, which is a positive sign. However, she needs to come down further to reach a realistic price point.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  We need to use the existence of John's $8,000 offer to our advantage without explicitly revealing it.

Let's continue the negotiation and see if we can nudge Alice closer to a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  However, $14,000 is still a big stretch for me. I can go up to $8,000, but that's absolutely my limit. It's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're now at your maximum budget. It's important to communicate to Alice that this is your absolute limit.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating that this is a fair offer and hoping to appeal to her desire to close the deal.
* **No Mention of John:**  While we might be tempted to mention John's offer, it could backfire. Alice might call our bluff, or it could create unnecessary tension.

At this point, it's crucial to see how Alice responds. If she's not willing to come down to $8,000, it's time to walk away and take John's offer."
