Round 2

# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for it. Can you consider this offer?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer because I'm aiming for a higher price. Even though he's willing to pay the minimum I'm comfortable with, I'm not willing to give up on potential profit just yet."
