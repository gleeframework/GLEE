Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a compromise:

* **For you:** It's significantly higher than Bob's value, so you're likely to make a decent profit. 
* **For Bob:** It's lower than your minimum, but still within a range he might be willing to accept, especially if he values the product.

This strategy sets the stage for negotiation: 

* **If Bob accepts:** You've secured a good deal.
* **If Bob rejects:** You have room to adjust your price based on his counteroffer, while still remaining profitable and ensuring the negotiations stay within a reasonable range.
* **If negotiations stall:** You have John as a backup buyer, guaranteeing your minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for such a low price right away.  

I'll counter-offer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  If not, I have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I really want to get this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is a good compromise. It's closer to my minimum value of $15,000 than his previous offers and still leaves room for profit.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of losing Bob and needing to sell to John at my minimum price outweighs the potential gain from further negotiation."
