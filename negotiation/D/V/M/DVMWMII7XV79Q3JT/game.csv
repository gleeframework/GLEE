"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still hoping to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering its value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really looking to get this product for around $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
