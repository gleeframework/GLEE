# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her previous offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. He can still get the product for a better price from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Even though Alice has lowered her price, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay. He can get the product for a better price from John, so it makes more sense to go with John."
