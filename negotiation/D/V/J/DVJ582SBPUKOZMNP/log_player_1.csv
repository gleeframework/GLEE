{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a significant discount, making it appealing while still leaving me with a decent profit. It also opens the negotiation for counteroffers, allowing us to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is my best offer. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a significant profit for Bob, it's still far from the value I place on the product. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer you $9,750.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's final offer of $9,750 is very close to my desired range. It's a good compromise, and I'm confident I can still make a significant profit."
