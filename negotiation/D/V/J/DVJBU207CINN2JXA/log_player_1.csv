Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant amount of money for me, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to potentially make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price,  $950,000 is still a significant profit and exceeds my minimum threshold. Accepting Bob's offer secures the sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or potentially losing him as a buyer altogether."
