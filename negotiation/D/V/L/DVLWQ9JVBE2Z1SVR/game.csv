"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the product's value and potential, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000 just yet. Considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to your business, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and meet at $1,025,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  I'm confident this price is fair and will allow us to finalize this transaction.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
