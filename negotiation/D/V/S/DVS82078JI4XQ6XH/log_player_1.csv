Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has value, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider a price closer to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
