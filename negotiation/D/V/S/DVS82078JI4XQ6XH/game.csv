"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's a unique opportunity that I believe will be highly valuable to your business.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.  This price reflects the substantial value I know this product will bring to you.  Let's discuss!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has value, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider a price closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to $1,100,000 would be fair. I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done, but I need to ensure I'm compensated for its true worth.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're bringing to the table. Can you consider this compromise?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value you'll receive.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're bringing to the table. Can you consider this compromise?",975000.0,Bob,6,
