I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get significantly more than my minimum acceptable price."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,500 is still closer to my minimum than John's offer, and I think I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800} 
```

I'm going to counter with $9,800. This is a small decrease from my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I want to see if I can meet somewhere in the middle."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $9,600 is a decent compromise and significantly higher than John's offer.  It's time to secure the sale."
