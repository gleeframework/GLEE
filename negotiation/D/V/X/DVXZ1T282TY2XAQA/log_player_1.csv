"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, reflecting the significant benefits you'll gain from owning it."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good strategy to start negotiations with a strong offer. This leaves room for potential concessions and gives the impression that the product is highly valued.
* **Close to Bob's Value:**  By starting close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000), we increase the chances of him immediately recognizing the potential gain. 
* **Justification:** Providing a brief justification for the price, emphasizing the product's value, adds weight to the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The language suggests a willingness to negotiate, leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe the asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than both our desired price and his own perceived value of the product. While we want to reach an agreement, accepting this offer would leave a significant amount of money on the table. We have room to negotiate and still secure a much better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true worth and potential for generating value.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,300,000. This reflects a fair compromise while acknowledging the substantial benefits you'll receive."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reject Low Offer:**  Bob's offer was far too low. We need to signal that we won't settle for significantly less than our target.
* **Significant Concession, But Not Too Much:** We've made a $100,000 concession, showing a willingness to negotiate but still maintaining a strong position.
* **Reiterate Value:** Reminding Bob of the product's inherent value helps justify the higher price point. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** Framing our counteroffer as a ""compromise"" encourages a collaborative negotiation approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,200,000 is a substantial profit above our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer to ""meet in the middle"" suggests he's likely close to his maximum willingness to pay.
* **Time Value & Risk:**  Continuing negotiations has diminishing returns. Accepting now guarantees the sale and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or us having to settle for less in later rounds."
