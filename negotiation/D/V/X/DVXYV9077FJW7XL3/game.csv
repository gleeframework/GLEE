,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount of $5000, bringing the price down to $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the discount, but $20000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay up to $15000 for the product.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting closer to a deal. I can offer you an additional discount of $1000, bringing the price down to $19000. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not willing to go any lower than this. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too far apart. I can offer you one last discount of $500, bringing the price down to $18500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",18500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay up to $17000 for the product.",17000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle after all. I can offer you one last compromise, but I need to make it clear that I'm not willing to go any lower than this. I can sell the product to you for $18000, which is $1000 above your last offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",18000.0,Alice,9,
