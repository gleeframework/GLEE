"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $900000.  It's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
