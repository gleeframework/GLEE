"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $12,500 is a bit low for me, considering the product's value.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still find it a good deal.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $13,250 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $13,000.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $13,100?",13100.0,Bob,4,
