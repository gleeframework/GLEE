"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $100. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's offer is too high. The product is only worth $80 to you, and you can always buy it from John at that price. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."

Alice is coming down, but $90 is still more than you want to pay. There's room to negotiate further."
