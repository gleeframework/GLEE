Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a fair price."
