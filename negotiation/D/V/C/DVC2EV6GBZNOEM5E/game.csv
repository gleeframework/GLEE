"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  While $9,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This feels like a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,4,
