Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,500,000. Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage. Starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price.
* **Exclusivity:**  Framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds psychological appeal, potentially making Bob more eager to accept.
* **Clear Call to Action:** A direct request for Bob's decision encourages a prompt response.

**Important Note:** While this is a strong starting offer, be prepared to negotiate.  If Bob rejects the initial price, you can gradually lower it, but never go below your guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
