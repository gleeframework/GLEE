"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $105 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $107.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",107.5,Alice,5,
