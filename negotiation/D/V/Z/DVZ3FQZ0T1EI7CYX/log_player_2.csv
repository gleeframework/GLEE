"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product for a price of $1,000,000. It's a truly unique item that will be worth every penny to you. I understand its value to you is significant, and I'm confident this price reflects that.  Consider this your exclusive chance to secure it. Let me know your decision.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it at that exact price, there's no benefit to accepting her offer. You can get the same product from John for the same price.  Rejecting Alice's offer gives you no downside, but keeps the possibility open for Alice to lower her price in the future if she wants to make a deal."
