"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is way above his budget, and he can potentially get a better deal with further negotiation or by buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. It's worthwhile to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $13,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm ready to pay $9,500 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's work together to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is unwilling to go lower than $12,000, which is still more than Bob's budget. At this point, Bob should take the guaranteed deal with John at $8,000. Further negotiation with Alice risks exceeding Bob's budget and wasting valuable time."
