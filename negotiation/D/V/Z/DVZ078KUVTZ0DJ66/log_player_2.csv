Bob should accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $11,500, which is $500 less than what John is asking.
* **Bob's goal is to save money:**  Even though Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000, accepting Alice's offer saves him money."
