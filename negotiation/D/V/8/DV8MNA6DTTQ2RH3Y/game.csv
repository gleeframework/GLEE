"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which I believe is a fair starting point considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,125,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This offer is a good compromise and reflects the value of the product for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
