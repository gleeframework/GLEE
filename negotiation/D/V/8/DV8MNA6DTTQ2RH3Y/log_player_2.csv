"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still above what the product is worth to you. You can get a better deal by rejecting and counter-offering.  There's a significant gap between your maximum price and Alice's offer, which gives you room to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which I believe is a fair starting point considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $1,125,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your desired price point. You have room to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to your initial counteroffer of $950,000.  Rejecting and counter-offering again can potentially lead to a more favorable price."
