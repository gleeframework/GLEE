Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which I believe is a fair starting point considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.
