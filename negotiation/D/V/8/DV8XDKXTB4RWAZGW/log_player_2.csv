"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $120. Considering its quality and benefits, I would like to extend this exclusive opportunity to you at a special introductory price of $110. This is a limited-time offer, so I hope you'll find it attractive. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good deal, it's still above your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the discount, but $110 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I am willing to consider a price of $105 for the product. I believe this strikes a fair balance between our interests. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $105 is within my budget and a good compromise.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and forcing me to buy from John at a higher price is too high.  Accepting this offer saves me $15 compared to buying from John."
