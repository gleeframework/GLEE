"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about your top limit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $10500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

``` 
Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000. He already stated his absolute top limit was $10,000, and while Alice is closer to that price, it's still more than he's willing to pay. Since he has a guaranteed alternative at his desired price, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
