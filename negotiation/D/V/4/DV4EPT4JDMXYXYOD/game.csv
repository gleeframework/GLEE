"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $9,500.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do think the product would be valuable, $9,500 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $7,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. Could you do $8,500? It's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,750? That seems like a fair compromise.",7750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're getting closer.  I can tell you're serious about the value this product offers.  How about we split the difference and say $8,125? That's my final offer.",8125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to move a bit higher, but $8,125 is still a touch too high for me.  Would you consider $7,900? That's a very strong offer.",7900.0,Bob,6,
