"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do think the product would be valuable, $9,500 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $7,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. Could you do $8,500? It's a fair price considering the value this product brings."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,750? That seems like a fair compromise.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, you're getting closer.  I can tell you're serious about the value this product offers.  How about we split the difference and say $8,125? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 8125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to move a bit higher, but $8,125 is still a touch too high for me.  Would you consider $7,900? That's a very strong offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to $8,000, it's becoming clear that he might not be willing to reach that threshold.  It's better to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John than risk Bob walking away."
