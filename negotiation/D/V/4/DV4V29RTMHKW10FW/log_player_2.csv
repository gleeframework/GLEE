"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as I'm sure you'll agree. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You value the product at $15,000 and Alice is offering it for $12,000, saving you $3,000.
* **You're still getting a good deal.** Alice is selling the product for less than her own valuation ($8,000), which means she's also making a profit."
