"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle. How about $900,000?  This price still leaves room for you to profit handsomely, and it allows me to achieve a more desirable outcome.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $875,000 is closer to what I need,  I'm still hoping to get closer to $900,000.  Let's split the difference. How about $887,500?  This price is fair to both of us and ensures a smooth transaction. What do you think?",887500.0,Alice,5,
