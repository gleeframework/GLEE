"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $20000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's roughly 3/8 of Alice's offer. This shows I'm serious about buying, but also gives Alice room to negotiate while still keeping the price within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $7500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17500. This is still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. While she has shown willingness to negotiate, the price is still too high. It's worth trying to counteroffer again and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $17,500 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's well within your original asking price and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with my maximum budget of $10,000. I've made it clear that this is my absolute limit, and I'm hoping Alice will recognize that this offer is still significantly better than her initial asking price. This could potentially lead to a quick resolution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10000 is simply not enough for me to part with this valuable product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13750. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,750 is still above my maximum budget. While it's a step in the right direction, I'm not willing to go above my limit. I'll try to counteroffer one more time, hoping to push her down to my price point. If that fails, I'll go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility.  However, $13,750 is still outside my budget.  As I mentioned before, $10,000 is the absolute limit I can reach.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hopeful you'll reconsider.  If not, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm reiterating my firm stance on the price. I've emphasized that $10,000 is my absolute limit, and it's a reasonable compromise considering Alice's initial asking price. This is my last attempt to secure a deal with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
