"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $20000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $7500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17500. This is still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $17500 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's well within your original asking price and allows me to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10000 is simply not enough for me to part with this valuable product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13750. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal. What do you say?",13750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility.  However, $13750 is still outside my budget.  As I mentioned before, $10000 is the absolute limit I can reach.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hopeful you'll reconsider.  If not, I'll need to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
