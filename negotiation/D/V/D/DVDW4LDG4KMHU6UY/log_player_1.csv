"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This gives me a strong starting point and leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm starting high to see if he's truly interested in paying a premium. If he rejects, I'll have to assess his interest and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to accept Bob's first offer.  He's starting at the very bottom of my range, and I think I can get more.  I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if I can reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm offering $1,800,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not desperate to sell at his initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $1,600,000, which is closer to my desired price.  While I'd prefer more, it's getting close to my minimum.  I'm not sure how much more I can get from him, and it's risky to keep going given the number of rounds remaining. I'm going to accept the offer and secure the sale."
