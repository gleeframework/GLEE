Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This price would be fair to both of us, as it's significantly lower than my maximum budget and still leaves you with a good profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
