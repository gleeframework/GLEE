"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I want to save as much money as possible and can likely get a better deal. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This price would be fair to both of us, as it's significantly lower than my maximum budget and still leaves you with a good profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $750,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This price takes into account your budget constraints while still allowing me to get a fair deal. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a good deal for me. It's significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,200,000 and still allows Alice to make a profit. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice rejecting my offer again, and potentially leading to a deal with John at a much higher price. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal for both of us and avoids unnecessary risk."
