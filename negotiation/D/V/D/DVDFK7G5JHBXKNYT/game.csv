"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Can you meet me in the middle?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth significantly more than that. How about we split the difference and go with $17500? I'm confident you'll find it a good value.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15000 and $17500, which would be $16250. Can you consider that?",16250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate. However, $16250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17000 as a final offer. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $17000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $16500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",16500.0,Bob,6,
