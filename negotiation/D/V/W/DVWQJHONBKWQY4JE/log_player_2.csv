"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this valuable product from me. I've done my research and understand its worth to you is $800,000. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this product at a discount. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above my target of saving as much money as possible.  I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this opportunity. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $725,000, which is only $25,000 more than my initial counteroffer.  This is a good price and getting closer to my goal of saving as much as possible.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my next counteroffer, and I might end up paying more or having to buy from John. Accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point."
