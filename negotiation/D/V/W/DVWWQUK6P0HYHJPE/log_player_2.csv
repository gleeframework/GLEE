Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your response. I understand your perspective, but $500,000 is significantly below the product's true market value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This reflects the product's potential and the value it can bring. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, but I need to be upfront -  $700,000 is just too far off from what I can accept. This product has substantial value that goes beyond even your initial assessment. To move this forward, I'm willing to consider $1,800,000.  I believe that's a significant concession on my part and a fair offer for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty, but I need to be equally transparent - I can't accept $800,000 for this product. It's worth significantly more, and I have other options if we can't find a mutually agreeable price. Given that this is important to both of us, let's find a way forward. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

It's clear that Alice is unlikely to come down to a price you're willing to pay. She's rejected your final offer of $800,000, which is your upper limit.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better outcome. Buying from John at $800,000 ensures you get the product without exceeding your budget."
