"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired selling point. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product's value is even higher than Bob's perceived $800,000.
* **Anchoring:** By presenting a high initial price, I'm ""anchoring"" the negotiation. Even if Bob rejects the offer, his counteroffer is likely to be influenced by this starting point. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,500,000 provides a safety net. I can afford to be more assertive in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your opening offer. That price is quite high for me. I'm more comfortable in the range of  $500,000 for this product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $500,000 is far too low. It's clear he's trying to anchor the negotiation significantly below his perceived value of the product. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm serious about the product's value and won't settle for a lowball offer.  I'm confident I can negotiate a much better price, especially knowing John provides a $1,500,000 safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your response. I understand your perspective, but $500,000 is significantly below the product's true market value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This reflects the product's potential and the value it can bring."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** Coming down by $300,000 shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, the new price still keeps the deal significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reiterating Value:**  By mentioning ""true market value,"" I'm reminding Bob that his initial perception might be undervaluing the product.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** While being open to negotiation, I'm maintaining a firm stance to avoid being lowballed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While I agree the product has value, $2,000,000 is still outside my budget. Would you consider $700,000? I feel this is a fair offer that acknowledges the product's potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, $700,000 is still significantly less than half my minimum acceptable price. It seems Bob is negotiating strategically but isn't yet close to a reasonable range. I need to signal that while I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept a low offer.  I'm hoping a firm rejection will encourage him to make a more serious offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but I need to be upfront -  $700,000 is just too far off from what I can accept. This product has substantial value that goes beyond even your initial assessment. To move this forward, I'm willing to consider $1,800,000.  I believe that's a significant concession on my part and a fair offer for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm clearly stating that Bob's offer is unacceptable while maintaining a willingness to negotiate. This balances firmness with a desire to continue the negotiation.
* **Smaller Concession:** Dropping to $1,800,000 is a smaller concession than before. This signals that I'm becoming less flexible as we approach a critical point in the negotiation.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** By emphasizing ""fair offer for both of us,"" I'm reminding Bob that a successful negotiation requires finding mutually beneficial terms. 
* **Time Pressure:**  As we progress through the rounds, the implicit pressure of a limited time frame increases. This might encourage Bob to make a more serious offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and that you value this product highly.  However,  $1,800,000 remains outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000.  This is my final offer, as it's the maximum I'm willing to spend.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** Bob's use of ""final offer"" is a common negotiation tactic. While it signals seriousness, it doesn't necessarily mean he won't budge. 
* **Still Too Low:** $800,000 is Bob's perceived value, but it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. Accepting would be a significant loss.
* **Leverage of Time and John:**  I still have a few rounds left and the security of John's offer. This gives me leverage to push back on Bob's ""final offer.""

By rejecting this offer, I'm calling Bob's bluff and signaling that I'm willing to walk away from the deal if necessary. This might encourage him to reconsider his position in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty, but I need to be equally transparent - I can't accept $800,000 for this product. It's worth significantly more, and I have other options if we can't find a mutually agreeable price. Given that this is important to both of us, let's find a way forward. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  "", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm and Final:**  I'm matching Bob's firmness by stating my ""absolute bottom line."" This creates a sense of urgency and signals my seriousness.
* **Significant Concession (But Above Minimum):** Reducing the price to $1,600,000 is a significant concession. It shows a strong willingness to make a deal while remaining above my absolute minimum and leaving some room for final negotiation.
* **Highlighting Alternative Options:**  Mentioning ""other options"" reminds Bob of John's offer without explicitly revealing the $1,500,000 price. This reinforces my strong position.
* **Call to Action:** I end with a direct ""call to action"" - ""let's find a way forward"" - to encourage Bob to engage constructively. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between firmness and flexibility, motivating Bob to make a serious move in the remaining rounds."
