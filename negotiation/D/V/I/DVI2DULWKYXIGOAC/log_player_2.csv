"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $90 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to get a better price from Alice.  Since you're willing to pay up to $100, you have room to negotiate.  Let's see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product. How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? I'm confident this product will be worth it for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $87.5, which is only $7.50 more than what the product is worth to you. It's not a steal, but it's a decent deal, and you've only used 3 rounds. Accepting now prevents the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a higher price or even a rejection."
