"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you is $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling for $12,000, while John wants $15,000.
* **You can still save money:** Even though you're paying more than the product is worth to Alice, you're still saving $3,000 compared to buying from John."
