"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the discount, $1,400,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows you to make a substantial profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is a fair price considering our positions. It's a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's see if we can close this deal at this price.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
