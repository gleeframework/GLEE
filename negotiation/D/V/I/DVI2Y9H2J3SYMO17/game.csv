"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the market demand.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer. However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $7,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to compromise further. I'm offering the product to you for $8,200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8200.0,Alice,5,
