"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. Let's get started with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to consider paying $950,000 for it. This would give us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's aim for a price of $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price that still allows us to do business together. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for this product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a mutually beneficial deal. Please consider my offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $1,050,000. This is my final compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $975,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would lead to a successful partnership. Please consider my offer carefully.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more significant concession and meet you at $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to meet me halfway.  However, $1,025,000 is still just a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product, which is the absolute maximum I can afford right now. I believe this would be a good deal for both of us, and it would allow us to move forward with the purchase.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one last offer, and it's a compromise between $1,025,000 and $1,000,000. I'll meet you at $1,012,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1012500.0,Alice,9,
