"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $14,000. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
