Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000.  This reflects the product's true value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $9,500 is a good price, and it's getting closer to my initial asking price.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer of $8,000."
