"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,800, which is the highest I can go. Can you consider that price?",7800.0,Bob,4,
