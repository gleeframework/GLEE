"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $999000. I think it's a steal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is very close to your maximum, it's still a bit high. There's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, you can potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $999,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $975000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $975,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's a significant drop from her initial offer and puts us closer to my budget.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk is that she'll reject my counteroffer and I might end up having to buy from John for a higher price."
