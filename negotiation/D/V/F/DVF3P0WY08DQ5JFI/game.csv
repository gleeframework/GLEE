"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. I could come down to $13,000.  What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I see the value in the product,  $13,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  How about we settle at $10,000? That's a significant reduction from my original price and reflects my willingness to make a deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
