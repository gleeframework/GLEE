You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. I could come down to $13,000.  What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  How about we settle at $10,000? That's a significant reduction from my original price and reflects my willingness to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to come down significantly from $10,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
