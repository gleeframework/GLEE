"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for. I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a good profit for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. I believe this price is still a great deal for both of us and allows me to earn a decent profit.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer you $1,025,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, allowing you to make a decent profit while I get a good deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,025,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
