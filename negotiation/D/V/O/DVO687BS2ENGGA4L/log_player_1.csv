Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure it'll be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, knowing that Bob values the product at $15,000. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm not willing to sell for $12,000. I will counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle on $14,000? That feels like a good compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I will counteroffer in the next round and aim for something closer to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate that.  Let's try $15,500. This is a fair price, and it allows us to both walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close.  I could do $14,500, but that's really pushing my budget.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for $14,500 just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a price closer to my target. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're almost there.  $15,000 is my absolute minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and agree to that price, but I can't go any lower.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
