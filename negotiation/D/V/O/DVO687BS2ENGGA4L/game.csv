"Bob, I'm offering you this product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure it'll be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let's try to meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle on $14,000? That feels like a good compromise to me.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate that.  Let's try $15,500. This is a fair price, and it allows us to both walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I could do $14,500, but that's really pushing my budget.  What do you say?",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there.  $15,000 is my absolute minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and agree to that price, but I can't go any lower.  What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,7,
