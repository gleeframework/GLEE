"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm afraid $700000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. My revised offer is $850000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $800000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $825000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid $855000 is still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get as close as possible to my minimum price. My revised offer is $900000, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free maintenance package and a 5-year warranty. I believe this is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",900000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate the extras you're offering, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and my original offer of $700000. I'll make a final counteroffer of $800000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,8,
