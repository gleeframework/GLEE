"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still gives you a good deal considering the product's value. Let's find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $775,000 is still too low for me. Let's find a more agreeable number.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
