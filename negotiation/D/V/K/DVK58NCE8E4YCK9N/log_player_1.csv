"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with an ambitious offer. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity. 
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the ""unique value proposition"" and ""true worth"", we aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is designed to test the waters and see how Bob reacts. It allows for several possibilities:

* **Bob accepts:**  Ideal, though unlikely.
* **Bob counter-offers significantly lower:**  This suggests we might need to adjust our expectations but still have room to negotiate.
* **Bob counter-offers close to his perceived value:** Indicates he's serious and we can likely reach a deal above his $1,000,000 valuation. 
* **Bob rejects outright:**  A sign he may be unwilling to meet our price range, and we might consider pivoting to John earlier."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches our minimum acceptable price, we can still aim for a better outcome. We've only completed two rounds, and there's room to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

Bob meeting us ""halfway"" suggests he might be willing to go higher than his initial offer. By rejecting and countering, we can assess his flexibility and try to secure a price closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  How about we split the difference between our previous offers? I propose $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting a split the difference approach, we signal a willingness to negotiate while still advocating for a price significantly above Bob's valuation.
* **Anchoring:** This counteroffer keeps the price point anchored well above Bob's offer, aiming to shift his perception of a fair deal. 

**Strategy:** 

We are moving towards a more realistic price range but maintaining pressure to maximize our profit. Bob's response to this counteroffer will be telling in terms of his flexibility and how much further we can push."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to try to get closer to my initial target. How about we meet at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now negotiating below his perceived value of $1,000,000. This indicates potential desperation or a strategic move. However, accepting this offer would mean settling for a loss. We are still better off with John's guaranteed $1,200,000.

**Strategy:**

We need to send a strong signal that we're not willing to go below our minimum. Our next counteroffer should be close to our acceptable limit, making it clear that this is our final position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I need to be upfront about my position. My absolute lowest price for this product is $1,175,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the value this product brings."", 
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  We're clearly stating this is our ""absolute lowest price"" and ""final offer"" to convey seriousness and limit further back-and-forth.
* **Justification:**  We're reminding Bob of the value proposition but also conceding slightly by coming down $25,000 from our guaranteed price with John.
* **Urgency:**  While not explicitly stated, setting a final offer implicitly introduces a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision.

**Strategy:** 

This is a calculated risk. We're aiming for a price that yields a profit while acknowledging Bob's constraints. It's possible he'll agree, but we're also prepared to walk away and take John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my previous counteroffer. How about we try $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is not budging significantly and remains well below our acceptable range. Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome. 

**Strategy:**

It's time to cut our losses. We've given Bob ample opportunity, but he's unwilling to meet our valuation. Selling to John guarantees us our minimum desired profit and avoids further time investment in a negotiation that is unlikely to result in a better deal."
