"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1200000 for the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and the benefits the product will bring to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to accept $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though! I'm proposing a price of $1100000 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1000000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm proposing a price of $1050000 for the product. It's a bit above your offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
