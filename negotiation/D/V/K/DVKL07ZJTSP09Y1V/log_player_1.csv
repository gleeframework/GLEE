"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a strong opening position that allows room for negotiation while ensuring I maximize my potential profit.  I'm confident that I can still reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob, even if he counters. If he doesn't, I can always fall back on the guaranteed $1,200,000 offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will make a counteroffer in the next round.  I need to try and secure a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,400,000.  This is a significant compromise, but it still leaves me with a healthy profit margin.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than what John is offering. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will continue to negotiate.  I might have to get closer to his offer, but I'm confident that I can still secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,250,000. This is a significant concession, but it keeps the price above my minimum acceptable price and John's offer.  I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges Bob's budget and allows me to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and even lower than John's offer.  With only 4 rounds left, the chances of Bob coming up to my acceptable price are slim. I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000, securing a guaranteed profit. It's better to secure a safe, albeit lower, profit than risk losing a better deal with a potential buyer."
