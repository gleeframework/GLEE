Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is simply too low for me. It's a fantastic product, and I'm sure you'll agree it's worth more than that.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.
