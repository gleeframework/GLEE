"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is simply too low for me. It's a fantastic product, and I'm sure you'll agree it's worth more than that.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $11,250 is my absolute maximum. Can you consider that?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. While $11,250 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this work. How about we meet in the middle one last time at $11,375? That would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we could finalize the deal.",11375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one last offer: $11,200. If you can meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",11200.0,Bob,6,
