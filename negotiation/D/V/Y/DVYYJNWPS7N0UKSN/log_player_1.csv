Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is above my minimum of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation to make Bob feel comfortable and encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and it's likely he won't go much higher. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit."
