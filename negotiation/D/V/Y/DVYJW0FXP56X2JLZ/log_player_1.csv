"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes my potential profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and encouraging a deal, highlighting the potential value for Bob. 
* **Room to Move:**  $1,400,000 is a significant amount, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This allows me to potentially negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even below my initial offer. 
* **Negotiation is necessary:** I'm confident I can get a better price with further negotiation. 
* **Selling to John is a last resort:** I'd prefer to sell to Bob if possible, but I won't settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,200,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.

* **Urgency:**  I'm using phrases like ""get us closer to a deal"" to subtly create a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still more than I can afford right now. I'm ready to pay $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can finalize this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still too low:**  $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to significantly undervalue the product.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room for Bob to increase his offer. He's shown a willingness to compromise, so I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price and that I have other options (like selling to John)."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, but $1,100,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000 as a final compromise. This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find a better value anywhere else. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,100,000.  It's fair to both of us and allows us to finalize the deal.  I'm confident we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still too low:** Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I've made concessions, I'm not willing to sell the product at a substantial loss.
* **Time is running out:** We're nearing the middle of the negotiation rounds, so I need to be strategic.  While I'm open to continuing, I'm not going to settle for a price that is not fair.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price and that I have other options (like selling to John).

**Next Round:**  I'll need to make a counteroffer that's still above my minimum price, but also reflects the pressure of the dwindling rounds. I need to find a balance between getting a good price and ensuring a deal."
