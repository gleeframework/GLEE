{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,400,000 is still too high. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,200,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Bob should continue negotiating.  $1,200,000 is still a bit high, and he can likely get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still more than I can afford right now. I'm ready to pay $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, but $1,100,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000 as a final compromise. This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find a better value anywhere else. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,150,000 is a significant decrease, Bob should continue negotiating. He can still potentially get the price lower, and he is still within his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,100,000.  It's fair to both of us and allows us to finalize the deal.  I'm confident we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000 as a final compromise. This is a fantastic price for you, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let's finalize this deal before we run out of time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's still a bit more than he initially wanted, it's within his budget and a good deal for him. It's also likely he won't be able to get a lower price, and he's already nearing the end of his negotiation rounds. It's better to secure the product at this price than to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John."
