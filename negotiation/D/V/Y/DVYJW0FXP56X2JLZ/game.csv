"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let's find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,200,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still more than I can afford right now. I'm ready to pay $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can finalize this.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, but $1,100,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000 as a final compromise. This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find a better value anywhere else. Let's make this happen!",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,100,000.  It's fair to both of us and allows us to finalize the deal.  I'm confident we can make this happen.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000 as a final compromise. This is a fantastic price for you, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let's finalize this deal before we run out of time.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
