"Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8500? Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $9000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. Let me know if this works for you!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9000 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $8750? I think that's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $8750. How about we meet in the middle at $8850? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. Let me know if this works for you!",8850.0,Alice,5,
