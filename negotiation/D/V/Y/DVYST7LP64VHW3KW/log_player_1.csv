{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a bit higher than what Bob values the product at, but it's also significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and hopefully, we can find a price we both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand your offer, but I'm still hoping for something closer to $95.  It's a fantastic product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it at that price."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $95.  This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum price.  Hopefully, this will be a price we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $92.50.  That's a great deal for you, and it's still a fair price for me.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

I'm offering a compromise at $92.50. This is a small step closer to Bob's offer, but still a fair price considering my minimum acceptable price. Hopefully, this will be enough to seal the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I think I can do a bit better. Would you be willing to meet me at $88? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $88 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's time to move on and sell to John for $120.  While I would prefer to get a higher price, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob and risk getting stuck with a lower price."
