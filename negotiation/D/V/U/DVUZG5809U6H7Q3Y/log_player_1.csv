Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This gives him a potential profit if he values the product higher than that.  It also leaves some room for negotiation if he counters. If he rejects, I can still sell it to John for $1,200,000, so I'm taking a calculated risk."
