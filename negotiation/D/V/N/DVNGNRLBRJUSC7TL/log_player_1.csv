I'm starting with a price of $1,800,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value, giving me room to negotiate. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,700,000.  This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value.  I'm hoping to reach a deal that's fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit lower than I'd like, it's only $50,000 less than my counteroffer, and it's above my minimum value.  Rather than risk further negotiations, I'll accept this offer and close the deal."
