# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique and valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $11,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I still think the product is worth more to you. I'm willing to take another step towards you and offer it to you for $11,250. This is a small concession, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is getting closer to Bob's target price.  At this point, Bob has a few things to consider:

* **Time:** It's getting late in the negotiation, and Bob only has a few rounds left.
* **Risk:** Rejecting this offer means risking Alice's counteroffer being higher, or even rejecting Bob's offer altogether.
* **Value:**  $11,250 is still a significant saving compared to buying from John for $15,000.

Therefore, it's more strategically sound for Bob to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
