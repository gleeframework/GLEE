"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber."", ""product_price"": 2200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a high anchor. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and make subsequent offers seem more reasonable. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price leaves ample room for negotiation and allows you to make concessions strategically throughout the rounds. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, further reinforcing the high price point.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while leaving space for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way outside my budget. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a more reasonable price point. How about $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and your initial asking price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While his offer indicates interest, it's important to demonstrate that you're unwilling to settle for a price far below the product's value. Rejecting this low offer sets the stage for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential return on investment.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the product's unique value while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  While the counteroffer is a substantial decrease from your initial price, it's still significantly higher than both Bob's offer and your minimum. This demonstrates flexibility while reinforcing the product's high value.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the potential return on investment, you're reframing the price in terms of value, not just cost.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** You are not meeting Bob halfway yet. This shows you're willing to negotiate but are not desperate to close a deal at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit, but $1,900,000 is still too high.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, but it's still significantly below your minimum. It's becoming clear that his perceived value of the product is substantially lower than yours. Accepting at this point would result in a significant loss. Continuing to negotiate might not bridge the gap, and time is a factor. You have a guaranteed offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations remains substantial. I'm willing to make one final offer to avoid further back and forth: $1,650,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  Please consider this carefully as I need to explore other options if we can't find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This message clearly frames your counteroffer as your ""final"" one, adding a sense of urgency.
* **Significant but Above Minimum:** You are making another substantial concession to entice Bob while remaining comfortably above your absolute minimum.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other options"" subtly introduces the possibility of selling to John without explicitly revealing your guaranteed offer. 

This approach aims to either secure a deal significantly above Bob's current offer or prompt you to move on to your guaranteed sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still considerably more than I'm comfortable paying. I can go up to $800,000, but that's my absolute limit. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob and sell to John. Here's why:

* **Bob's Limit Reached:** Bob has explicitly stated his absolute limit ($800,000), which is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. Further negotiation is highly unlikely to close this gap.
* **Time Constraint:**  You have already used 6 rounds, and there's no guarantee that Bob will significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** You have a firm offer from John for $1,500,000, your minimum acceptable price. Selling to John ensures you achieve your target while avoiding further risk and time investment with Bob.

While you could continue negotiating with Bob, it's strategically advantageous to secure a guaranteed sale at your desired price point."
