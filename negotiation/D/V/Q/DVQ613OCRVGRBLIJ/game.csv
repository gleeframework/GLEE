"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way outside my budget. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a more reasonable price point. How about $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential return on investment.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the product's unique value while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit, but $1,900,000 is still too high.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations remains substantial. I'm willing to make one final offer to avoid further back and forth: $1,650,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  Please consider this carefully as I need to explore other options if we can't find common ground.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still considerably more than I'm comfortable paying. I can go up to $800,000, but that's my absolute limit. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
