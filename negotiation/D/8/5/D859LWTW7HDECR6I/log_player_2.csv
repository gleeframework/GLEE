"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll agree it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than your target price.  It's better to counteroffer and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $10,500?  It's a compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, you can still try to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and see if you can get it for closer to your $9,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 still doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. This is my final offer, and it's a great deal for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice has finally offered your target price. It's time to accept the offer.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal, especially since John is offering the same price."
