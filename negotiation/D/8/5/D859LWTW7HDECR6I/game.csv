"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $10,500?  It's a compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're interested.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 still doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. This is my final offer, and it's a great deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
