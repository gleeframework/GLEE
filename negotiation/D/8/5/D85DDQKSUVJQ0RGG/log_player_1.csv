Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** We're getting close, but Bob is consistently undervaluing the product.  It's worth the risk of one more counteroffer.  We're still above Jhon's offer, and there's a chance Bob will concede to a price closer to $900,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with. To finalize this today, how about we land at $887,500? This represents a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the true value of this product. What do you say?"",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit off from my target. How about $875,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we were aiming higher, Bob's offer is still a significant profit above our $800,000 alternative. Continuing to push risks losing him as a buyer altogether, at which point we'd be left with the guaranteed $800,000 from John. It's time to secure the deal."
