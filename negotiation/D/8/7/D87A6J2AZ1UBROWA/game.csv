"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which still reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This would allow us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,250 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this work. Let's try $9,750.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away with a positive outcome.  What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,5,
