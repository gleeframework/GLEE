"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a highly profitable investment for you. I propose a starting price of $2,000,000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and the potential returns on investment.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,400,000 is a tempting offer, I believe this product's true value is significantly higher.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I still think $1,800,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,600,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product's value and potential returns.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
