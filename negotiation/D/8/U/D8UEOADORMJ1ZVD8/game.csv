"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a great starting point.  I'm really interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $7500.  Would you be willing to consider that?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $7500 is a bit lower than what I'm aiming for, but I'm willing to come down to $9000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more breathing room. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer. $9000 is still a bit higher than where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $8250?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
