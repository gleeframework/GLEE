"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. How about we start the negotiations at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. $700,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm open to finding a middle ground. Let's compromise at $900,000. This allows for a healthy profit for me while remaining a good deal for you.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
