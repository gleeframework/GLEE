{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe this is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer allows for some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. I will counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm confident this price still represents a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8500. Would you be willing to consider $8750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling at $8,750.  It's better to sell to John for $10,000 and guarantee my minimum acceptable value."
