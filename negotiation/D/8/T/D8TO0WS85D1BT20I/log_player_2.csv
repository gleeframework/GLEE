{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  There's a good chance we can get a lower price.  We'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let's start by offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. This will gauge her willingness to negotiate and potentially open the door for a more favorable deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is showing some flexibility, but $400,000 is still too high.  We'll counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to our target price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're getting closer, but $450,000 is still more than we're willing to pay.  Let's keep pushing for a lower price.  We have time on our side and can always fall back on John's offer if things don't work out."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has returned to her original price. This could be a tactic to try and pressure us, but we're not going to give in. We'll counteroffer one more time to see if we can get her closer to our target.  If she rejects again, we'll have to decide if we want to accept her price or go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 425000}
```

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and it's time to show Alice we're serious. This offer is a compromise - we're willing to meet her halfway, but it's our final offer. If she rejects it, we'll have to seriously consider going with John's offer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is being inflexible and seems to be holding out for a higher price.  We've reached the end of our negotiation window, and it's time to move on. Buying from John is the best option at this point, even though it's more expensive.  We've tried our best to get a better price from Alice, but it doesn't seem like she's willing to budge.  We can't risk running out of time and having to pay an even higher price if she continues to be stubborn."
