Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,300,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, potentially getting us closer to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintaining option to sell to John:**  If Bob doesn't accept, I still have the option of selling to John for my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for counteroffers:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a higher price, potentially reaching a more agreeable compromise. 
* **John is a backup:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for my desired price, guaranteeing a positive outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,100,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it allows us both to meet in the middle. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's midway between my previous offer ($1,300,000) and Bob's offer ($1,100,000). This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and reach a compromise.
* **Still above minimum:**  $1,200,000 is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to emphasize why this price is still fair. 
* **Closing the deal:** I'm using language like ""finalize this deal"" to encourage Bob to accept and move forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,150,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $1,150,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to be fruitful:** Bob is showing a reluctance to go above $1,150,000, making it unlikely we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John guarantees my desired outcome:** Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum price and don't lose out on potential earnings.  While I would have preferred a higher sale price,  taking advantage of John's offer is the most sensible decision to maximize my profits."
