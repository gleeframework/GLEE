"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my interest in the product. However, $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $12,000. It's the lowest price I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to buy the product today, but I can only offer $11,000.  It's a fair price considering I'm paying cash and ready to finalize the deal right now.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're eager to finalize the deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $12,000. I've already compromised significantly. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, like a free installation and a one-year warranty. I think that's a great value for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the extras you're offering, but  I'm still sticking to my budget.  $12,000 is just too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is a fair price considering the installation and warranty. If you're serious about selling, let's make this happen.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower, Bob. I've already given you a great deal with the extras. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $12,000, which is $11,750. That's the best I can do. What do you say?",11750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm still sticking to my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,250, which is a fair compromise and allows me to finalize the deal. Let's be reasonable and finalize this sale.",11250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll sell the product to you for $11,500, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",11500.0,Alice,9,
