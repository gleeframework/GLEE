Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I can aim higher with Bob to potentially increase my profit. 
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A $15,000 offer is a 50% markup, which is significant but not outrageous. It leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **First-Mover Advantage:** By framing the offer as a pre-market opportunity, I'm creating a sense of exclusivity and urgency for Bob to act quickly."
