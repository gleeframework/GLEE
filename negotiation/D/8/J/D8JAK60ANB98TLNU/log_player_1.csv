Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $100. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 gives some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Avoid a ""Lowball"" Offer:** Offering a price too close to $80 (your minimum) might make Bob think the product isn't valuable and deter him from buying. 
 
This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept."
