{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer leaves room for negotiation while still securing a substantial profit for me.  It's also higher than John's offer, making it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500?  That's still a great deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price,  I'm not willing to go lower than $10,000.  John's offer is my safety net, ensuring I don't lose out on a sale completely."
