Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is great, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This gives you a good profit and saves me some money. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit stretched at that price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we could finalize the agreement.
