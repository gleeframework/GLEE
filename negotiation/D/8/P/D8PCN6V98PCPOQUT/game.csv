"Alice, your product is great, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This gives you a good profit and saves me some money. Let's see if we can make this work.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000.  It's a good compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you, considering your valuation. Let's try to reach an agreement here.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit stretched at that price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we could finalize the agreement. ",1050000.0,Bob,4,
