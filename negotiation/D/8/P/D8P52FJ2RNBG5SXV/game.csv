"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe it will be of great benefit to you.  My starting price is $1,200,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price within our negotiations.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 asking price. I would like to propose an offer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about $1,050,000?  It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I still feel that the product's value does not justify the $1,050,000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $1,025,000. This seems to be a reasonable midpoint between our previous offers.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
