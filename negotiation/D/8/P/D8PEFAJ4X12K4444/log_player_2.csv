"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob starts with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still higher than his absolute maximum of $8,000. This shows he's serious about buying but is pushing for a better deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By offering $8,500, Bob leaves room for Alice to counter without feeling like she's giving away too much. This keeps the negotiation open.
* **Expressing willingness:** Bob clarifies that this is his best offer, indicating a potential end point to the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice has lowered her price, $10,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate, and Alice has shown flexibility.  There's potential to get the price closer to Bob's target by continuing to negotiate.
* **No urgency:** There's no indication that buying from John is time-sensitive, so Bob has the luxury of trying to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,000.  However,  that's still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:**  Bob increases his offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  He's still below Alice's price, but getting closer.
* **Finality:**  Stating this is his final offer adds pressure to Alice, possibly encouraging her to accept.
* **No room for more:**  This is a significant jump from his previous offer, leaving less room for further counteroffers, potentially forcing Alice to make a decision."
