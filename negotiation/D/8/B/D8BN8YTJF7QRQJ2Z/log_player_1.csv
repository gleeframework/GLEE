"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $140.  It's worth $150 to you, so you'll be getting a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly lower than the product's worth to Bob, hoping to entice him to buy quickly. However, I'm also leaving room for negotiation if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price of $140.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit to $135. This is still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm offering a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while also maintaining a profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant at $135. Would you be willing to go down to $130 again? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to my original asking price, the negotiation has gone on for a few rounds now.  It's likely that Bob won't budge further.  $130 is still a good profit for me, and it's better than selling to John for $120.  I'll accept and move on."
