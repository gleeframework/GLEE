"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my offer. While $825,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would you consider that price?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",800000.0,Alice,5,
