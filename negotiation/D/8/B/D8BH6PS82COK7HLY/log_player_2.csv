"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product at a special price. I believe you'll find it's a valuable addition to your collection. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but still not ideal.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and Alice is offering it for $950,000. This saves you $50,000.
* **There's potential for a better deal.**  You haven't exhausted all your options yet. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or potentially find another seller.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to save as much money as possible. Rejecting Alice's offer keeps your options open and gives you leverage to potentially get a better deal."
