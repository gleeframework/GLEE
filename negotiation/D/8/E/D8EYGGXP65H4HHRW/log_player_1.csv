Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's value:**  This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you still make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can adjust the price down if necessary.

Remember, this is just the first step. Be prepared to counteroffer and negotiate based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $11,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's tempting to accept his offer and avoid further negotiation, it's not a good deal for you.  You have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, and you can likely negotiate a better price with Bob.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can continue the negotiation and hopefully reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more from my initial offer. How about $13,000? That would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:** This counteroffer is still above Bob's maximum value but lower than your initial offer. It shows you are willing to negotiate but are not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Maintaining profit:**  This offer still provides you with a significant profit margin.
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes a win-win situation, keeping the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $13,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,800? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,800 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While it would be ideal to get closer to your original valuation of $15,000,  it's important to weigh the risks and rewards. 

* **Potential loss:**  Further negotiation could result in Bob backing out or lowering his offer again.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Accepting this offer guarantees you a profit of $800, which is better than nothing. 
* **Time factor:**  Continuing negotiations could take time, and you may miss out on the opportunity to sell to John.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most logical decision in this situation."
