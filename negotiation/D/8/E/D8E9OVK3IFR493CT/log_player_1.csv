""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $2,300,000."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think your initial offer is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
We are still significantly above John's offer, so we have room to negotiate. Let's counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the unique benefits this product offers."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

We are aiming for a middle ground while still staying significantly above our ""walk-away"" price. Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about the value of the product, Alice, but I still think $2,000,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to compromise and propose a price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product and the benefits it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While closer, $1,800,000 is still too far from our desired profit margin.  We'll make another counteroffer, but we're getting closer to the point where John's offer might be more appealing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I'm confident you won't find a better deal on a product of this quality and potential."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

We're making a smaller concession this round to signal that we're nearing our bottom line.  Let's see if Bob is willing to bridge the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,800,000 and $1,900,000, which would be $1,850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While we could potentially push for a bit more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher.  Accepting $1,850,000 gives us a significant profit over our minimum and avoids the risk of negotiations breaking down."
