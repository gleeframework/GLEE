"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000.  I think this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. It's too high and there's still room for negotiation.  He can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $9,000 is still higher than his maximum price, and he's already indicated he's willing to go up from $7,500. He should counter with a price closer to his limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $9,000 is still a bit high for me, though. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
