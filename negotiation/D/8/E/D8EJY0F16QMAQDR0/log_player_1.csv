""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. I'm willing to make this transaction particularly attractive for you with a special offer. Would you be interested in discussing a price around $1,400,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly lower might raise suspicions or undervalue the product. A high initial offer leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit margin for Alice.
* **""Special offer"" framing:**  This creates a sense of exclusivity and encourages Bob to consider the deal seriously.
* **Open to discussion:** The phrase ""around $1,400,000"" suggests flexibility and invites Bob to counter-offer, starting the negotiation process.

**Goal:**  Alice aims to secure a deal significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, ideally closer to her own valuation. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John at her desired price."
