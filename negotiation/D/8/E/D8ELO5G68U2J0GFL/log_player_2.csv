"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is way above my budget of $8,000. It's not even close to a reasonable starting point.  I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2

While Alice is continuing to lower her price, $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm also getting close to my limit of $8,000. I'll reject and see if I can get her to come down further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're making progress. I'm still hoping to get this deal done, but $11,000 is a stretch for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $10,000.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $10,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. We are down to our final round, and I'm getting nervous about the risk of not getting a deal at all.  While I'd prefer to save another $1,000, I'm going to buy from John for $8,000 to guarantee a purchase.  There's no point in risking getting nothing."
