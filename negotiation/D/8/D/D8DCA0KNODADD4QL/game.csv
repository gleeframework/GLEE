"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product, which is still a very fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $800,000 is too low, I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
