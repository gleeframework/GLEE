Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $15,000. I believe it will bring you a lot of value."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet at $13,500?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Can you see your way to meeting me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to budge significantly beyond his $11,000 offer.  While I might be able to negotiate a bit more out of him, the certainty of John's $12,000 offer makes it the more profitable and less risky option."
