"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my ideal price. I know it's a high asking price, but Bob has a lot to gain from this product, and I have a backup buyer in John. This sets the stage for a negotiation and hopefully allows me to get closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round.  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's a chance I can get a higher price from Bob with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm reducing my offer to $1,100,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping this counteroffer will entice Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to continue negotiating. While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, I'm still hopeful that I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,050,000. This is a significant move, bringing me closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding onto some value for myself. I believe this compromise might convince Bob to agree and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is finally at a price that I'm comfortable with.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, I have already made several concessions and there are only 4 rounds left.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and secures a reasonable profit. I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer and then potentially having to sell to John at a lower price in the future."
