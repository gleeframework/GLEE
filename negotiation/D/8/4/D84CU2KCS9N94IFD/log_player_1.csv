"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Confidence:** I'm expressing confidence in the product's value, hoping to encourage Bob to see its potential.
* **Openness:** I'm inviting Bob to engage in conversation, encouraging him to share his thoughts. 

**Note:** This is just the first offer. I'll adapt my strategy based on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation.**  I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial price.
* **I want to see if Bob is willing to budge further.**  By rejecting his offer, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate and open to negotiation. 
* **The risk of selling to John is still there, but I have 8 more rounds to potentially reach a more favorable price.** 

**Next Round:** I'll likely make a counteroffer between Bob's offer and my initial offer, aiming for a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. Would you consider $13,500? It's a compromise, and I believe it's still a good value for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer but still higher than his offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise but also holding firm on my value perception.
* **Justification:** I've provided a reason for the counteroffer, emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting the compromise aspect.
* **Openness to Further Discussion:** The message ends with a question, encouraging Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Overall Goal:**  This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while leaving room for further negotiation if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still at $12000. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's stance is clear:**  He's sticking to his $12,000 offer and doesn't seem open to further negotiation.
* **Selling to John is still a viable option:**  The risk of selling to John for $10,000 is still present, but I have 6 rounds remaining.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I'm hoping that by rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially push him higher or cause him to reconsider his stance in the next round. 

**Next Round:**  I'll likely send a counteroffer slightly higher than $12,000, but closer to his offer, to see if I can inch closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price. I'm willing to come up slightly to $12,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Emphasize value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Offer a middle ground:** I frame my counteroffer as a ""meeting in the middle,"" appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.

**Next Steps:** 

* If Bob accepts, I'll sell the product for $12,500.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12500, but I'm still at $12000. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We are in round 6, leaving only 4 rounds left.  
* **Little room for negotiation:** Bob has been firm on $12,000, and it's unlikely he will budge much further.
* **Risk of selling to John:**  Selling to John for $10,000 is a real possibility if I continue to reject offers. 
* **Acceptable price:**  While $12,000 is not my ideal price, it's above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and within a reasonable range. 

**Decision:**  Considering the time constraint and the risk of selling to John, accepting Bob's offer of $12,000 is the most pragmatic choice."
