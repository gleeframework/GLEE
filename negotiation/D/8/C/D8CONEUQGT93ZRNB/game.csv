"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be valuable to you. I know you're familiar with its capabilities, and I'm confident it would be a great asset to your company. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $12,000. This represents a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll receive. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
