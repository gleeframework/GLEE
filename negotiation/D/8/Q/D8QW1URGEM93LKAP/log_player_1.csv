"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer ($20,000) as a negotiation tactic. This gives me room to lower the price later if needed.
* **Value Emphasis:** I emphasize the product's worth to me, aiming to make Bob see it as a valuable item and potentially justify a higher price.
* **Open-ended Question:**  The open-ended question encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation and provides an opportunity for him to share his thoughts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can only pay $5000 for the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.** I need to earn at least $15,000, and $5,000 is far too low.
* **I still have 8 rounds left.** This gives me time to negotiate and potentially find a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is a viable option, but I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.**  There's potential for negotiation, and I haven't exhausted all options yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $5,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a drastically low price.
* **Highlight Value:** I reiterate the product's worth, reminding Bob that $12,000 is still a fair price for the value he's getting.
* **Emphasize Fairness:** I emphasize that $12,000 is a fair compromise for both parties. This can make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $6000. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.**  While it's an increase, it's not enough for me to consider selling.
* **I have 6 rounds left.**  There's still time to try and negotiate a better price. 
* **Selling to John is an option, but I'm not ready to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob.**  I need to see if I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $6,000 is still far from what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,000, but that's really my final offer.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Persistent but Firm:** I'm staying firm on my need to earn a decent price.  I'm not going to give it away, but I'm willing to make small concessions to show flexibility.
* **Final Offer Language:** By calling this my ""final offer,"" I create a sense of urgency and potentially push Bob to accept.
* **Value Focus:** I keep emphasizing the product's worth to reiterate why my price is justified."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to offer $7000 for the product. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that Bob will come close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000, which meets my minimum requirement.
* **Risk of Lowering Price:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks ending up with an even lower offer. I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price significantly below my minimum.

It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed deal with John.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, the risk of further negotiation with Bob is too great at this point."
