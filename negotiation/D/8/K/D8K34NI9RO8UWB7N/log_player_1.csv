"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $14,500 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $12,500 would be a good starting point. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","While Bob's offer is lower than I'd like, it's still a decent profit. I'm risk-averse in this situation.
