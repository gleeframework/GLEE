"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to leave room for negotiation.  This also shows confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I have 9 rounds left and John is still an option if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's find a compromise we both can agree on."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. We have 6 rounds remaining before I have to make a decision on John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,800 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,200. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and our previous discussions. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $8,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,900 for the product. Can you consider my offer?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting closer, but Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. With only 4 rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to reach a profitable agreement with Bob.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000, which guarantees me a decent profit and ensures a quick and secure sale."
