,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's find a compromise we both can agree on.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,800 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,200. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and our previous discussions. What do you say?",8200.0,Alice,5,
