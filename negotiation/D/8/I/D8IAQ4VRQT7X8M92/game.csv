"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value we both see in it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you think $850,000 is a fair price, but I was really hoping to get closer to the value I know this product has. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000. This is a compromise I'm willing to make to see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a little out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal. Let's see if we can close this.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",925000.0,Alice,5,
