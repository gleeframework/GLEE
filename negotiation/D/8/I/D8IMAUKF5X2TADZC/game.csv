,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have a limited budget, Bob, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $8000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $12000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. I'm really interested in it, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet at $9000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $11000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. I'm really interested in it, and I think this price is fair considering our previous discussions. Can we meet at $9500?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to think about my bottom line. How about we meet at $10500? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm starting to get a bit anxious about the price dropping too low. I think this is my final concession.",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make one last concession, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $9800 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. Can we meet at $9800?",9800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $10000, Bob. I've made several concessions already, and I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but I'm not going any lower. This is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,9,
