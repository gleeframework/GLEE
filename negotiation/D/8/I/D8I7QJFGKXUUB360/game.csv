"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1000000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's try $1050000.  I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
