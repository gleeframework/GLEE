"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $650000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $725000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $700000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700000. I'm willing to make one more concession.

"I understand that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer you the product for $750001. This is a very slight increase, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",750001.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid I'm not willing to go above $725000, Alice. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on that price. Can you consider meeting me at $725000?",725000.0,Bob,8,
