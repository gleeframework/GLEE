Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it holds significant value for you as well. I'm starting with a price of $1,250,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but reflects the product's true worth. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I need to be flexible, I'm not willing to sell for so far below my minimum.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  The product's value is significantly higher, as you acknowledged.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both the product's worth and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're making progress, but I'm still not comfortable with $925,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $987,500?  This would be a fair compromise, allowing both of us to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.  Let's bridge the gap and finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 987500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting closer.  While $987,500 is tempting, I'm aiming for a final price closer to $950,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 7

Round 8
Bob's offer:
