"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it holds significant value for you as well. I'm starting with a price of $1,250,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but reflects the product's true worth. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  The product's value is significantly higher, as you acknowledged.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both the product's worth and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but we're still a bit apart.  Would you consider $925,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I think it represents a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're making progress, but I'm still not comfortable with $925,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $987,500?  This would be a fair compromise, allowing both of us to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.  Let's bridge the gap and finalize this transaction.",987500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting closer.  While $987,500 is tempting, I'm aiming for a final price closer to $950,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 still falls short of my expectations. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a final price of $968,750. This offer reflects a fair compromise and allows us to conclude this negotiation successfully. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",968750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're practically there!  I'm willing to make one final push to seal the deal. How about $956,000? That's a very strong offer, and I'm hoping we can avoid further negotiation.",956000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your desire to finalize this, and I'm happy to make one final concession.  I'm willing to accept $962,500 for the product.  This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it will allow us to reach a mutually agreeable outcome.  Let's close this deal and move on to bigger things.",962500.0,Alice,9,
