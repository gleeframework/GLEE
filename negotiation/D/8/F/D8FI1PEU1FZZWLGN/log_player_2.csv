"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it holds significant value for you as well. I'm starting with a price of $1,250,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but reflects the product's true worth. Let's see if we can find common ground.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  The product's value is significantly higher, as you acknowledged.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're making progress, but I'm still not comfortable with $925,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $987,500?

Round 7

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your desire to finalize this, and I'm happy to make one final concession.  I'm willing to accept $962,500 for the product.
