Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit. If Bob rejects, I can see how strongly he wants the product and adjust my offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll see if I can get him closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still ensures a decent profit. I hope Bob sees this as a reasonable price and accepts, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."

Bob hasn't budged from his $12,000 offer.  While I'd prefer more, it's still a profit and better than selling to John.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
