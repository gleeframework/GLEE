"Bob, I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to own a truly unique and valuable product. I'm confident it will be an excellent investment for you. My initial offer is $1500000. This is a starting point, and we can certainly negotiate further. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on this product, my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $800000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for this product. I'm offering you $1200000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the current offer. I would like to propose a price of $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value. I hope you'll find this proposal acceptable.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $950000 still isn't quite where I need to be.  I'm proposing $1100000 as a final compromise.  I believe this is a fair price that considers both our needs.  Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
