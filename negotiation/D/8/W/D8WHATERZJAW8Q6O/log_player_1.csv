``` 

This offer is a starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my desired value while still leaving room for Bob to feel he's gotten a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to earn. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking to get a little closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it still leaves some room for you to make a profit.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,125,000 for your product. This price reflects a compromise that allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. I hope you consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is only $25,000 away from my minimum acceptable price of $1,150,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, I'm willing to accept this offer.  It's a good deal for both of us, and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely to John, or getting stuck in a protracted negotiation."
