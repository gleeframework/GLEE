"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider a lower price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. How about we settle at $800,000?  That's a fair price and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $800,000 is a fair price for you, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a good deal for you. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,5,
