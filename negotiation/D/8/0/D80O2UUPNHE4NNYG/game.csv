"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further and finding a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. This is my absolute maximum, as I have another option for this product at that price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, my valuation for this product is considerably higher based on its unique aspects that I believe you'll find incredibly beneficial.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's true worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value this product highly, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my serious interest.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my position.  While $1,100,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this price accurately reflects the value you'll gain from this product.  What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget.  As I mentioned before, my absolute maximum is $800,000. If you're unable to come down to that price, I'll need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
