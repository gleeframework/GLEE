"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to part with it for $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you mentioned.

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to make another compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $725000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",725000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $725000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. Let's talk about what we can do to make this work.",725000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go back to the previous offer, but I'm willing to make a new proposal. I'd like to offer $675000 for the product, and I'd also like to propose a trade-in deal. I have an old product that's worth $25000, so if you're willing to accept the trade-in, I'd be willing to pay $650000 for the new product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",650000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the creative proposal, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept the trade-in offer. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price. I'll counteroffer at $700000, and we can discuss other terms and conditions to make the deal more attractive. Let's focus on the product's value and find a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Alice,9,

"I've made it clear that I'm willing to pay up to $650000 for the product. I'm not willing to go any higher. If you're not willing to sell it to me for that price, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $1000000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",650000.0,Bob,10,
