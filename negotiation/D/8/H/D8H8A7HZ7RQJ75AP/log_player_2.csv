"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $12,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but $18,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He can either counteroffer again or choose to buy from John if he believes further negotiation won't be successful."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can only go up to $13,000. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your seriousness about buying the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $14500. It's the best I can do at this point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $14,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  While further negotiation is possible, there's a risk that Alice will continue to hold firm on a price too high for Bob.  John offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget, making him the best choice in this situation."
