"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $1200000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850000, which is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit below my minimum target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1050000 is still a bit beyond my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  It's the absolute highest I can go, and I truly hope we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1000000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1075000. This is the absolute highest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.
