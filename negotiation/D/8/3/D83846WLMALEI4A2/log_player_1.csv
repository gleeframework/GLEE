I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,800,000. This is a significant profit for me while still leaving room for Bob to potentially make a good deal. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **My Floor:** I know the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, so I won't sell it for less. 
* **Bob's Unknown Value:**  I don't know Bob's perceived value, so I'm aiming for a price that is attractive but not so low that I leave a lot of money on the table. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If Bob rejects, I'm still guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.  This gives me some leeway to try and get a higher price from Bob. 

This strategy balances my need to maximize profit with the uncertainty of Bob's valuation."
