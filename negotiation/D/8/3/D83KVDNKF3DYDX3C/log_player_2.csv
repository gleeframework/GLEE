```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $9,500.** This is still higher than your maximum budget of $10,000.
* **You have a backup option with John for $10,000.**  While this is your limit, it's still a better deal than accepting Alice's offer. 

Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the most financially beneficial choice."
