"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset worth significantly more to you, and this price reflects that. Let's start our negotiations here, but remember, I have other offers on the table. ",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000.  I think that's a fair starting point.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is far below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. It's a fair compromise given its worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I need to stick to my budget. How about $750,000?  That's a significant move on my part to meet you closer to your price.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $750,000 is still significantly lower than what this product is worth to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I believe we can close this deal.  Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I can go up to $775,000, but that's really pushing it for me.  Let's get this done!",775000.0,Bob,6,
