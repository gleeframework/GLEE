Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

This offer leaves a profit of $1,000 for you, which is less than what you'd get from John, but still a significant amount.  The strategy here is to try and get as much as possible from Bob, but knowing that you have a guaranteed backup buyer, you don't have to take a huge risk.  Bob might be willing to pay a little more than his perceived value to avoid losing the product, making this a potential win-win."
