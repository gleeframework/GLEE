Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To demonstrate my commitment to getting this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise that benefits us both.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, she's unlikely to go below $1,450,000, which is her ""final offer"". You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  It makes more financial sense to take the guaranteed lower price from John, saving $450,000."
