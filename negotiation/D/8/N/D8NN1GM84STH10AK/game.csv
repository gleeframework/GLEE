"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1000000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $950000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still a bit tight on budget.  I'm prepared to offer $925000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product fairly.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to be frugal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $940000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need you to meet me at $940000. What do you think?",940000.0,Alice,5,
