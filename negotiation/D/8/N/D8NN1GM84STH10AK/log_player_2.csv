"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above your target price of $1,200,000. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  A $100,000 reduction shows you're serious about buying but not giving in easily.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  You're still $300,000 below Alice's value, allowing for several more rounds of negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and professional tone is important to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is closer to your target, but still $50,000 above your maximum. You have several rounds left and can likely push for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer again, potentially saving more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still a bit tight on budget.  I'm prepared to offer $925,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product fairly.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight increase:** This demonstrates your willingness to meet halfway but still pushes for a lower price.
* **Final offer:** By stating this is your final offer, you create a sense of urgency and pressure on Alice.
* **Emphasize value:**  Reiterating your belief in the product's value reinforces your seriousness while justifying your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to be frugal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $940000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need you to meet me at $940000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Alice's offer is now only $20,000 above your maximum price of $1,200,000.
* **Limited negotiation room:** You've already made several counteroffers, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk Alice walking away or John's offer becoming unavailable.

It's a good idea to accept this offer. You'll save $80,000 compared to buying from John, and there's a chance you could lose the product altogether if you keep pushing for a lower price."
