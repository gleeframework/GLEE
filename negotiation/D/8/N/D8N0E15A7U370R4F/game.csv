"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment of the product's value, I would like to propose a price of $700,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to consider.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, reflecting a significant discount from my initial offer.  This price still leaves you with a considerable profit margin, while allowing me to achieve a reasonable return on my investment.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
