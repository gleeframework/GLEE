"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $120. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still unable to meet at $135. Could we perhaps aim for $125? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still getting a good deal.",125.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $140, Bob. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet at $140.",140.0,Alice,5,
