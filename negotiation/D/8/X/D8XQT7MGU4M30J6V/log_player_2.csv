Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $90 is still a bit low for me. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $105.  While she might still be open to slight negotiation, it's not worth the risk of her going back up in price or the deal falling through entirely. John offers a guaranteed price of $100, which meets Bob's needs and saves him money."
