""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $9,200 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $7,000?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss a price of $8,500? I think it's a fair compromise that works for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go all the way down to $7,750, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about we discuss a price of $8,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's the minimum I'm willing to accept.

``` 

This is the best possible outcome for you (Bob). Here's why:

* **Alice is at her limit:** She explicitly stated $8,000 is the minimum she'd accept. Pushing further might make her break the negotiation.
* **Excellent savings:** You're getting the product for $2,000 less than John's offer and $200 less than Alice's initial offer. 

Delaying further might risk losing this deal."
