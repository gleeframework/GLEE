"I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,200. Is this something you'd be interested in?",9200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $9,200 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss a price of $8,500? I think it's a fair compromise that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $8,500 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to settle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go all the way down to $7,750, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about we discuss a price of $8,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's the minimum I'm willing to accept.",8000.0,Alice,5,
