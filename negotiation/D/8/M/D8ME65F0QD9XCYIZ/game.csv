"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $11,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,500. I think this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and the market rate.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but $11,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at least $11,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you say?",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,500 again, as I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market rate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,6,
