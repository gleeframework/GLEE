Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything significantly below my minimum."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $11,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,500. I think this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and the market rate.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell and I'm confident I can find a buyer who's willing to pay closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but $11,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at least $11,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,500 again, as I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market rate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm starting to feel like he's not serious about making a deal. I'm tired of negotiating, and I'm not going to waste any more time. I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000, which is a fair price and will allow me to move on."
