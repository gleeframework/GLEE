Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  The product's minimum value to both you (Alice) and Bob is $1,000,000. This suggests it's something significant.
* **Bob's Value:** Knowing Bob values it at $1,000,000 means there's room to negotiate above that price.
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, giving you a strong negotiating position.
* **Aim High:** Starting with a significantly higher offer ($1,500,000) allows room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, leading to a price potentially higher than your guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves some risk. If Bob outright rejects the initial high offer, you might miss the chance to negotiate. However, the potential reward of securing a higher price makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
