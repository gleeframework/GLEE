"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get a good starting point. I'll be flexible and willing to negotiate, but I'm confident that I can get a fair price within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I would like to close the deal, $120 is significantly less than what the product is worth to me.  I'll counter with a more reasonable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
``` 

I'm lowering the price to $155, which is still higher than John's offer but closer to Bob's.  This is a compromise to encourage Bob to accept while ensuring I still profit from the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll counter again. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm continuing to lower the price, but still aiming for a decent profit. I'm confident I can get to a mutually agreeable price before I have to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $135 is still less than my ideal price, I'm starting to run out of time.  I'm confident I can close the deal with John if I need to, but I'd rather sell to Bob and avoid the risk of a last-minute change of heart from him."
