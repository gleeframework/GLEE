"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that's worth $1000000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for $900000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, there's room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering. There's no guarantee that Alice will accept, but Bob is in a strong position knowing he has an alternative (John) willing to sell for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000.  This is a fair price considering I can get it for $1,000,000 elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $825000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer of $900,000.  Accepting $825,000 saves Bob $175,000 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and the potential for a prolonged negotiation makes accepting this offer the most logical choice."
