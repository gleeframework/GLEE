"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. I believe it's a fair starting point for us to discuss.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere? How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle at $12,500?  This is my final offer, as I do have another interested buyer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you have other buyers, but $12,500 is still above my budget. I could go up to $11,500, but that's my absolute limit.",11500.0,Bob,6,
