"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. It's a truly unique opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $2000000. I believe this is a fair and competitive offer, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is there any flexibility on your end to meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant amount, but I'm afraid I can't quite meet you there. However, I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $1800000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value and uniqueness. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1800000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1500000. Can you consider that?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $1700000. It's a unique product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to make one more compromise: I'll meet you at $1650000. That's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Can you consider that?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
