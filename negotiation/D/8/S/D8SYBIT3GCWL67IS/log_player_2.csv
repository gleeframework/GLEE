"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it for $1,600,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your actual target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial lowball offer will help us understand how eager Alice is to sell and how much lower she might be willing to go. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We always have John's offer of $1,000,000 as a backup, so there's no pressure to settle for a price we're uncomfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm motivated to sell, $800,000 is significantly below its value.  Could you consider $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down from her initial offer, $1,400,000 is still significantly higher than both our target price and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate, even if slightly, suggests she might be open to further reductions. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting this offer, we maintain our position and signal that we're serious about a price closer to our range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,400,000 is still quite a stretch for me.  I could consider going up to $900,000.  That's a significant offer on my end."", ""product_price"": 900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're increasing our offer, but by a smaller amount than Alice's previous decrease. This shows movement but also maintains our position.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for our offer (""significant offer on my end"") strengthens our position without revealing too much about our budget.
* **Approaching the Limit:** We're slowly moving towards our upper limit ($1,000,000), keeping in mind that we always have John's offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're still a ways apart. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This reflects the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:**  Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above our maximum budget of $1,000,000. 
* **John's Guarantee:** We have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,000,000. There's no point in risking further negotiation with Alice when we have a sure deal within our budget.
* **Time Value:** Further negotiation takes time and effort. Accepting John's offer provides a clean and immediate resolution."
