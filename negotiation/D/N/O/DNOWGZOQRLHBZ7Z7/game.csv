"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $1,050,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This gives us both a fair deal, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be an excellent investment.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still thinking $1,050,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,075,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1,075,000 is simply not enough for me to part with this product.  How about we meet in the middle again?  I'm willing to come down to $1,087,500.  Let's see if we can close this deal. I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product.",1087500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I'm not going any higher. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
