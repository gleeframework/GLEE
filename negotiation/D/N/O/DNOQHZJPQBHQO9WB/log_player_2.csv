Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $925,000 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $975,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite there for me. I'm willing to go down to $960,000 as a final compromise. This reflects the significant value this product offers you.  Let's close this deal.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly trying to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible.  While we could try to push further,  the difference at this point is relatively small, and there's a risk she won't budge. Taking the $960,000 secures a good price for the product."
