Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $800,000 (Bob's max) and $1,000,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob walks away.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can afford to be a little bolder.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" enhance the perceived value.
* **High Anchor:** Starting at $925,000 gives you room to negotiate down while still staying above your minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if John is your only other offer) creates a reason for Bob to act quickly.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get a great deal at $925,000.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  He might counter-offer.  Be prepared to come down slightly, but hold firm to a price above $1,000,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for your guaranteed $1,000,000. You lose some potential profit, but you were prepared for this outcome."
