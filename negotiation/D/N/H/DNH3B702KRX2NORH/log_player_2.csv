"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  The product is worth $12,000 to him, and Alice is asking for $15,000.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $13,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I can see you're a serious buyer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm going to counter with a price of $14000. This is my best offer for now, but I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, it's still above his maximum value.  He should try to negotiate further to see if he can get a lower price before buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit too high at $14,000.  How about we settle on $13,500?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a persistent buyer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'll counter with a price of $14250. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to listen if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's final offer of $14,250 is still above Bob's maximum value of $12,000.  It's better to buy from John at his guaranteed price of $12,000, rather than risk further negotiation with Alice and potentially ending up paying more."
