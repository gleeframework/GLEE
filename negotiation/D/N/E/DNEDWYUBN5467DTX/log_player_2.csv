It's better to reject Alice's offer.  You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, or you can always fall back on John's offer for $800,000."

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a range that could be appealing to her, given her desire to sell the product."

While you'd prefer to pay less, Alice's offer of $885,000 is getting very close to your ideal price point. It's likely that further negotiation will only lead to a small reduction in price, and could risk losing the deal altogether.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product."
