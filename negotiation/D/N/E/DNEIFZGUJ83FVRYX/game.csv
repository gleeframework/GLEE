"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling the product to you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I think you'll find it's a fair and reasonable offer. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
