"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price of $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $100 is less than your maximum budget, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to work with me. However, $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be happy to pay $85 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** You're aiming to get the price closer to Alice's value of $80.  
* **Strategic Counter:**  A $15 reduction from Alice's offer is a significant move, demonstrating your seriousness in negotiating. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** $85 is still within your budget and leaves room for Alice to counter if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $92. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for improvement. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and gives you a chance to make another counteroffer to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $92 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm happy to offer $88 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Progress:**  You're slowly closing the gap between your desired price and Alice's offer.
* **Strategic Offer:** A $4 decrease from Alice's offer shows you're serious about getting a good deal, but it's still a reasonable compromise. 
* **Remaining Flexible:** By leaving room for Alice to counter, you keep the negotiation open and increase the chance of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product for $90. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer of $90 is very close to your desired price range and significantly less than John's $120 offer.
* **Limited Rounds:** You only have 5 rounds remaining. There's a good chance you won't be able to negotiate a lower price in the remaining time.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal altogether and having to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential small gain you might get by rejecting the offer. 

Accepting the offer allows you to secure the product at a reasonable price while minimizing the risk of missing out on a good deal."
