Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000.  I believe it holds significant value that justifies this price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""significant value,""  Alice subtly implies that the product might be worth even more than $10,000 to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer starts at $10,000, the tone suggests a willingness to discuss the price further if Bob shows interest but hesitates at the initial figure. 

**Important Note:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't have to sell below her minimum price. This allows for a more assertive opening offer to Bob."
