"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget of $120. You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows for potential negotiation to a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $105.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $105, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $115 is still too high, even though she met you halfway. You're determined to get the best deal possible and are still willing to negotiate further to try to reach a price closer to your $105 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $115 is still a bit above my budget. Let's split the difference and go with $110. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit above my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $112. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $112 is within your budget of $120 and is only $2 more than your last counteroffer. While you would have preferred a lower price, continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price without risking a higher price from John."
