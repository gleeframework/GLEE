Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum acceptable price:** I know I can get $800,000 from John, so this is my baseline. 
* **Potential for higher price:**  I don't know Bob's valuation, so there's a chance he might be willing to pay more than John.  A $100,000 increase is a reasonable starting point to test the waters. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** By starting high, I leave room for potential negotiation if Bob counters with a lower offer.

This offer balances the risk of losing Bob to John with the potential for earning a higher price."
