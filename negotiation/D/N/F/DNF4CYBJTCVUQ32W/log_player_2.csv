"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. This is a great deal for you, and it ensures I can still get a fair price for it. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is lower than her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a better price with Alice or proceeding to purchase from John at your desired price point."
