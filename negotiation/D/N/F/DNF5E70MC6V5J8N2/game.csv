"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's make this happen!",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point, but $8,500 is still a bit much for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7,250 is still a little low. Let's split the difference and go with $8,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",8000.0,Alice,5,
