{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is more than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $14,000 is less than Bob's valuation of $15,000, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can adjust your offer based on Bob's response. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is at your minimum, you can potentially get a better price by continuing the negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to explore the possibility of getting a price closer to your initial offer of $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not able to meet at $13,000. Could we perhaps aim for $12,500? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise. It's higher than your minimum of $12,000, and it's closer to your previous offer of $13,000.  Accepting this offer allows you to secure a sale at a price that is favorable to you."
