Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum value for the product.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  He'll see value in the deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you can still increase the price a bit, or potentially lower it if needed.

Remember, you can always choose to accept John's offer if negotiations with Bob stall.  Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still worth seeing if you can get closer to your initial offer. You have a good chance of getting a higher price if you counter, and there's always the option to sell to John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $13,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  This would still be a good deal for you as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to you."", ""product_price"": 13500}
