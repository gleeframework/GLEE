"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to propose a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $13,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  This would still be a good deal for you as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good deal:**  $13,500 is still a good price for Bob, considering the product is worth $15,000 to him.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again risks Alice rejecting the offer and potentially leading to a higher price or no deal at all.
* **Time and effort:**  Accepting the offer saves Bob time and effort compared to continued negotiation."
