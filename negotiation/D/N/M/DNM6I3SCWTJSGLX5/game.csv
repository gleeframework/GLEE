"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product for $950,000. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love, and I'm willing to make a generous offer to get the sale started.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but I'm afraid $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. How about we discuss $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $875,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. How about we settle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! $800,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $825,000? I think we can make a deal at this price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825,000 is very tempting, but I have a hard limit on my budget. My final offer is $810,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other option.",810000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $820,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the price. Let me know if this works for you.",820000.0,Alice,7,
