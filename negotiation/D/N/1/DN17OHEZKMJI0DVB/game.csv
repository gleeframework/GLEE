"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $950,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This price still offers you a great value, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980,000. Can you consider this offer?",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $980,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work.  To find a solution that benefits both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.
