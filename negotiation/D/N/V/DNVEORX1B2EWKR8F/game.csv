"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $80. Would you be willing to consider that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $80 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can come to an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is closer, but unfortunately, it's still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference.  How about $110?  I believe this is a fair price, and we can both walk away happy.  What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $110 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $100.  This is my final offer, so let's see if we can reach an agreement.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $100 is definitely closer, but it's still a bit below where I need to be. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $105. It's a small difference, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal.  What do you say?",105.0,Alice,7,
