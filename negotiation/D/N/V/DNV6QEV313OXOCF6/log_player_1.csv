{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your interests, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its significant worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize your profit, you need to aim for a price closer to Bob's valuation while ensuring he's likely to accept. 

**The Offer:**

* **$1,350,000** leaves a significant profit margin for you ($550,000 above your minimum) while still offering Bob a substantial discount ($150,000) compared to his own valuation. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have some leverage and that Bob might be willing to pay a premium to secure the product immediately rather than risk you selling it to someone else."
