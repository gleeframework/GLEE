# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a better price. Since you have a backup option with John, there's no harm in trying to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it, which reflects its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a better price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  You're still closer to your target price of $1,000,000 with John. There's no need to rush into accepting an offer that's still significantly higher than your budget. Continue negotiating with Alice to see if you can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,150,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This would allow both of us to walk away with a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is stating this is her final offer, and while $1,125,000 is closer to your goal, it's still higher than the price offered by John.  You have 5 rounds left, but the risk of a deal falling through and having to start over with another seller is too high.  It's better to secure the product at a known price with John and avoid further negotiation uncertainty."
