"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it, which reflects its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a better price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,150,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This would allow both of us to walk away with a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
