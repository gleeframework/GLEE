I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value, giving me room to negotiate. I'm hoping to get closer to the maximum value Bob might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is still a good amount of money, I'm confident I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway, but still closer to my initial asking price.  I believe this price is fair and gives Bob some room to negotiate if he wants to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,250,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal and much better than selling to John for $1,000,000.  I'm happy with this outcome."
