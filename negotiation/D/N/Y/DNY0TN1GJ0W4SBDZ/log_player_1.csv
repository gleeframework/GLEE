"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob might be willing to pay a little more, but I'm also ready to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to drop to that price yet. I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum value of $100. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a great deal for you, and it's still a fair price for me.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $85.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob seems determined to stick to his offer of $85.  While I'd like to get closer to my minimum value, I'm worried that continuing to negotiate will only waste time. Selling to John for $100 is the best option at this point."
