"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth a lot more to me. What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000 at this point.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $12,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's make this happen.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there yet. How about $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm seeing that we're both moving closer. However,  $13,000 is still just a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,5,
