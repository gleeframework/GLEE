"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I'm aiming for a higher price. It's worth exploring further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $9,250?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but $9250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** $9,000 is significantly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($8,000) and getting closer to my initial asking price.
* **Negotiation:**  We're already 4 rounds in, and Bob's offers have shown a willingness to compromise.
* **Risk:** Further negotiation might not lead to a higher price, and I risk running out of rounds. 

It's a good deal, and accepting ensures a solid profit."
