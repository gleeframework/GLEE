"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting price is too high. While it's below your maximum, there's room for negotiation to get a better deal. You'll reject and propose a lower counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?"", 
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than Alice's opening offer, you create room for negotiation. 
* **Respectful Tone:**  The message acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating your position. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is closer to Alice's value ($8,000) than your maximum ($10,000), giving her an incentive to counter while still leaving you with potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $8,200 for the product. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to her actual value, indicating she's willing to negotiate. However, there's still a potential for savings.  Rejecting this offer and countering slightly below her offer will likely lead to a final price close to her $8,000 valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice. How about we settle at $7,800? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", 
""product_price"": 7800
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer meets Alice halfway between her last offer ($8,200) and your previous one ($7,000).
* **Pressure and Incentive:** It signals your willingness to be reasonable but also puts a little pressure on Alice to finalize the deal. 
* **Close to Target:** This price is very close to Alice's likely bottom line, maximizing your savings while still making it likely she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,800 is a bit more reasonable, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can do $8,500 for the product, which is still a great deal for you. It's the highest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Limit:**  Alice explicitly stated this is her highest price, and it's unlikely she'll budge much further.
* **Savings vs. Risk:** While you could try for a slightly lower price, you risk pushing Alice away.  The potential savings are relatively small now compared to the possibility of losing the deal. 
* **Acceptable Price:**  $8,500 is still a significant savings from your maximum and a reasonable compromise."
