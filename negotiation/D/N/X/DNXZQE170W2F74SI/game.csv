"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the special feature upgrade, but unfortunately, $14000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we agree on a price of $13500 for the product, including the special feature upgrade? This still offers you significant savings compared to the market rate.",13500.0,Alice,3,
