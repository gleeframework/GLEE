"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and your interest, I propose a price of $14000 for it. This offer is exclusive to you and comes with a special feature upgrade valued at $1000 for free. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $14,000 is higher than Bob's maximum price of $15,000.  It's worth exploring if a lower price can be negotiated."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the special feature upgrade, but unfortunately, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we agree on a price of $13500 for the product, including the special feature upgrade? This still offers you significant savings compared to the market rate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is still within Bob's budget and a significant savings compared to John's offer of $15,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting this offer ensures he gets the product at a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially failing."
