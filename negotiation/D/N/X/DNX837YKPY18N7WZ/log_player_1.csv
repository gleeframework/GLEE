Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This is a time-sensitive offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value and the existence of other buyers to justify the high price.
* **Time Pressure:**  Creating a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While $1,500,000 is a significant markup, Bob might be willing to pay a premium if the product's value to him truly is $1,200,000 and it solves a critical need. 
* **Negotiation:** This initial offer opens the door for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then decide whether to move closer to your minimum or maintain a firm stance."
