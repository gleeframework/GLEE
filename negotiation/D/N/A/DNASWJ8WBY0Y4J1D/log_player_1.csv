Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay it, considering the value he places on the product.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'm not willing to sell for $12,000. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is still higher than my minimum, but it's a compromise from my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000.  Since John is willing to pay that amount, I'll sell to him."
