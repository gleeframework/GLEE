"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a truly unique and valuable item, and I believe it would be a great asset for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate down and leaves space for Bob to make counteroffers.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to pique Bob's interest and potentially make him willing to pay more.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm using a positive tone and expressing willingness to negotiate to encourage Bob to engage. 

**Next steps:**

* I'll closely monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* If he counters with a low price, I'll likely counter back with a slightly lower price, but still above my minimum value.
* If he rejects my offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and weigh my options before making a decision.
* If the negotiations stall, I'll have the option to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe the product is worth more. Accepting this offer would be a loss.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, and rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiations and hopefully secure a better price. 
* **Time on my side:**  With 9 rounds left, I can afford to decline this offer and see if I can get a higher price. 

**Next steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my initial offer but still reflects the product's value.
* I will carefully consider Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* If I feel the negotiations are going nowhere, I can still opt to sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a good starting point, I believe the unique features of this product warrant a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and our desire to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob about the unique features of the product to justify the higher price.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:**  I'm using a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiating.

**Next steps:**

* I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* If he counters with a lower price, I'll consider my options and decide whether to accept, counter with a slightly lower price, or stick with my current offer.
* If he rejects my offer, I'll  evaluate whether to continue negotiations or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I understand that the product has unique features, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal:** $11,500 is significantly higher than my minimum price of $10,000 and represents a good return on the product.
* **Time is running out:** With 6 rounds left, continuing to negotiate risks losing a good deal and potentially ending up with a lower price.
* **Potential for further negotiations:** While I'm accepting the offer, I can still try to negotiate for better terms or conditions in the future.

**Next steps:**

* I will accept Bob's offer and close the deal. 
* I will also explore opportunities to improve my future negotiations by learning from this experience."
