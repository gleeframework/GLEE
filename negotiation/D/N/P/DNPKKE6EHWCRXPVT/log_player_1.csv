"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a decent starting point, giving Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  $60 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm reducing my price to $130, which is still above my minimum price of $120 but shows flexibility in the negotiation.  This should encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll reject this offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm dropping my price further to $110. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm also getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I hope this will encourage Bob to come up with a final offer that is more acceptable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get even closer to $120. I'll make one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm dropping my price to $100. This is a significant compromise on my part, but I believe it's a reasonable offer considering Bob's persistent low offers. It's still above my minimum acceptable price, but I'm hoping this will convince Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is close to my minimum price, I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk getting stuck with an even lower offer.  I'll sell the product to John for $120, which is a safe and guaranteed profit."
