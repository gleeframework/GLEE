Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still within your budget of $120 and represents a better deal than buying from John for $120. While further negotiation could potentially get the price lower, it's risky as you might end up paying more or even losing the product. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product within your budget."
