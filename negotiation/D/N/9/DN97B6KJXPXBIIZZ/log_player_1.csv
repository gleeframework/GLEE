Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($100) and what I believe Bob is willing to pay ($80). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Messaging:** The message is friendly and highlights the value of the product. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This offer is likely to be rejected by Bob, but it allows me to start the negotiation process and gauge his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum ($100), it's still below what I'm aiming for.
* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can likely get closer to my desired price. 
* **John as a safety net:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me the confidence to hold out for a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price, but I'm also making it clear that I'm not willing to go significantly lower.
* **Reasonable Counter:** $95 is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's, making it a logical compromise.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize that my price is fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but $95 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $92.50 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $90.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with only John's offer of $100.
* **Time is Money:** Continued negotiation might take more time and could lead to a lower price. Accepting this offer ensures a quick and decent profit."
