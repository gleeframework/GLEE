"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $950000 is a bit lower than I was expecting. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1050000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and offered you a price that's $75000 above my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm not losing money on this deal. I'm now offering the product to you for $1025000. This is my final concession, and I expect a serious commitment from you if you want to proceed.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1025000. I'd like to revisit the price of $975000, which I think is a fair price for the product. Can we discuss this further?",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm afraid I've already made significant concessions and I need to prioritize my own interests. I'm willing to make one more attempt to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I need to be closer to my minimum price of $1100000. I'm now offering the product to you for $1075000. This is my last offer, and I expect a serious commitment from you if you want to proceed.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1075000. I'd like to revisit the price of $990000, which I think is a fair price for the product. Can we discuss this further?",990000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement. I've made significant concessions, and I'm still $110000 away from my minimum price. I'm willing to make one final attempt to meet you in the middle. However, I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1050000, which is $50000 above my previous offer. This is my last and final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
