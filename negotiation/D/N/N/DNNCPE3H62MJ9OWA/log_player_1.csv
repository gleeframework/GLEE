{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's perceived value.  
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes a good deal for both of us.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not giving away the farm. 
* **Plan B:**  I have a backup buyer in John, which gives me leverage if Bob is too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **I have leverage:** I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's message indicates he's interested in the product and willing to negotiate. I can use this to my advantage in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counter-offer.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, making my counter-offer more attractive.
* **Positive Framing:**  My message is still positive and friendly, maintaining a good relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $950,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  Bob is still willing to negotiate, and his offer is closer to my previous counter-offer, suggesting a potential deal is within reach. 
* **Leverage:** I have the option of selling to John for a higher price, giving me leverage in the negotiation.

I will counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round, aiming to close the gap while still staying above my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,000,000.  This would be a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product and would allow us to both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my counter-offer slightly, showing flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of my offer, reminding Bob of the product's value and the benefit of a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Final Offer?:**  I'm approaching my minimum acceptable price, hinting that this might be my final offer. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:** I'm still above my minimum price, ensuring I don't sell below my acceptable threshold.

At this point, I'm hoping Bob will accept my offer, but I'm prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think we can do better. I'll meet you at $980,000, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $980,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. However, there's still a significant gap.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate, with both of us unwilling to budge further.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a much higher price, which is my priority. 
* **Future Potential:**  Even though I'm getting a good price from John, I could potentially explore other buyers in the future if this product is replicated or if I have similar products to sell.

While I'm disappointed I couldn't secure a higher price from Bob, it's essential to prioritize maximizing my profit and ensuring a successful transaction."
