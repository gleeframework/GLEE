"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value. I'm willing to let it go for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $1200000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1600000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1600000 is the right price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Can you consider that?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to negotiate, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm counteroffering at $1700000. This is my final offer, but I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit skeptical about the product's value, to be honest. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be confident that I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. That's my final offer.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your skepticism, but I'm confident that the product's value far exceeds $1300000. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1900000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I've made a serious offer of $1300000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to negotiate, but I've already made a significant concession by offering you $1900000. I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1900000 and $1300000, which is $1600000. This is my last offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.",1600000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $1300000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Bob,10,
