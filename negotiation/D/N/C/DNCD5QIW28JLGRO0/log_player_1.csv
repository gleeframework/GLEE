{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm willing to make a special offer of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above that.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a deal.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to act quickly before he potentially loses the opportunity. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation tactics or financial limitations beyond his perceived value of the product."
