This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for some bargaining.  It also includes a friendly message to encourage a positive response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($10,000), it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to achieve a price closer to $9,500.  Selling to John guarantees me $10,000, but there's a chance I can get more by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to try to get closer to my target. Would you be willing to consider $8,750? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $9,000.  There's a good chance I can still negotiate a higher price.  Although selling to John guarantees me $10,000,  I'm motivated to see if I can squeeze out a slightly better deal with Bob."
