"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? It's a competitive price that reflects the true value of the product.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. While I recognize the value of the product, $10,250 is still a bit steep. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,750. This represents a fair price for both of us, allowing me to get the product within my budget and you to get a good deal.",9750.0,Bob,4,
