"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it's a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $14,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",14000.0,Bob,4,
