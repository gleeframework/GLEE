Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle on $925,000?
