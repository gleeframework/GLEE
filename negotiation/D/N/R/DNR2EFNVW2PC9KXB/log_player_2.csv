Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to sell. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle on $925,000? This price is a fair reflection of the value of the product, and it allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At $925,000, Alice's offer is a good compromise.  It's significantly less than her initial offer and allows you to save $75,000 compared to John's price. Continuing to negotiate might not yield much more, and there's a risk Alice could become less willing to compromise."
