"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, recognizing its value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was expecting a higher counteroffer considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,350,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll sell it to you for $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
