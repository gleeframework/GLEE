"Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to accept.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still too far below my minimum.  Given the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to make one final concession and come down to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the benefits you'll receive from the product. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to move on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems firm in her pricing. While $1,200,000 is a better deal than her initial offer, it's still significantly more than John's offer of $1,000,000.  At this point, further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to bridge the $200,000 gap. It's more beneficial to cut losses and secure the product at the guaranteed lower price from John."
