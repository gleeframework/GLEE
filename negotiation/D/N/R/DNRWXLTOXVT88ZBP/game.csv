"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to accept.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,150,000. Would that be agreeable to you?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still too far below my minimum.  Given the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to make one final concession and come down to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the benefits you'll receive from the product. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
