Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $15,000, but also recognizing that Bob values the product at $12,000.  This price leaves room for negotiation while still being reasonably close to my desired outcome.  I'll evaluate Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but still below what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can find a price that works for both of us. I will try to make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer to $14,000. This demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise but still want to get a price closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer is getting increasingly low. It's likely that further negotiation won't get me closer to my desired price point, and I'm risking losing the deal entirely. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $15,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
