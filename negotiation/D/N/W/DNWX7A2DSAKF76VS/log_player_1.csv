Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** Offering a ""special price"" creates a sense of value and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting at $125, we aim for a price that's beneficial for both parties.  If Bob rejects the offer, we're still guaranteed $150 from John."
