"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering it's well below your asking price and still within my budget. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,
