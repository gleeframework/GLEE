"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90, which is slightly above the value the product holds for Bob. This gives him room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially earn more than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value of $80. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm offering $85. This is still above Bob's initial offer, but closer to my minimum value. I'm hoping to find a compromise in the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below $80. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm not willing to settle for less than $80 unless I run out of rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
```

I'm counteroffering with $82. I'm inching closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price that's above my minimum value.  I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $79 is very close to my minimum value, I'm running out of rounds. If I reject his offer and counter, I risk not being able to close a deal at all. It's better to secure the $80 sale with John than to gamble on a potentially lower price with Bob."
