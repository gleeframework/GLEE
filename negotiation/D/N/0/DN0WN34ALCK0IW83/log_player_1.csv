Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential benefit I see in the product. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is truly significant and I can't let it go for less than $1,100,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, considering the value we both see in this product. I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear it's going to be a long negotiation to get him close to a price I find acceptable.  John offers a clean $1,000,000 which, while not ideal, avoids further negotiation and risk."
