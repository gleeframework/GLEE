"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. Let's start with a price of $1,400,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is too high. It's above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  You should try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,350,000, which is a compromise between our two numbers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still a bit high. You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm firm on $1,325,000. If you're willing to meet me there, I think we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your number, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $1,320,000, which is a bit higher than your last offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is very close to your last counteroffer of $1,325,000.  It's a good deal for you, and you're getting closer to your goal of saving as much money as possible.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and you'll have to pay $1,500,000 to John.  Accepting this offer is the best balance of getting a good price and minimizing your risk."
