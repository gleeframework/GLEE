"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. Let's start with a price of $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. Let's see if we can work something out.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,350,000, which is a compromise between our two numbers. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm firm on $1,325,000. If you're willing to meet me there, I think we can close this deal.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your number, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $1,320,000, which is a bit higher than your last offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,5,
