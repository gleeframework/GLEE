"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us - you'll be getting it for a great price, and I'll be able to move it quickly. Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but I am only willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I've also found another seller, John, who is willing to sell it to me for $800,000. I'd like to see if you're willing to meet me halfway.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I would like to propose $875,000 as a compromise. This still allows me to save some money compared to your initial asking price, while providing you with a reasonable profit. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the sense that we're not too far apart. I'm willing to come down to $890,000 for the product. This price is still fair for me, and it's a significant savings for you compared to my original offer. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",890000.0,Alice,5,
