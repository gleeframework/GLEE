"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $90 is below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? This is a very fair offer for such a high-quality product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105. How about we try $97.50?",97.5,Bob,4,
