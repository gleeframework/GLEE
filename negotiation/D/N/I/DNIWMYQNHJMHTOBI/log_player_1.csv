Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $20,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value ($15,000). This is to maximize potential profit.  I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum value, I still have 8 rounds left and the potential to earn more. It's risky to accept Bob's offer right away. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $17,500? I think that's a fair price, and it shows that we're both willing to compromise."", ""product_price"": 17500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to make a profit, but $17500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is close to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I've already negotiated a higher price and I'm confident that I can at least match John's offer of $15,000 if I continue negotiating. I'll counter with a price closer to my preferred range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement this round."", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly below my minimum. While there are 4 rounds remaining, I'm not confident that I can convince Bob to pay closer to my desired price.  John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is a much safer option at this point."
