Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $600,000 undervalues the product significantly.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,000,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's make this final offer, $900,000.  This reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice is unlikely to go below $900,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
