Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14500} 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, but still a good profit for me.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying the product, and this price might encourage him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is still a good profit for me, but it's closer to Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate."

Bob's offer is getting too low for me. I'm not comfortable accepting it, and I'm running the risk of going back and forth with him for a while.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm happy with, so I'm going to sell to him."
