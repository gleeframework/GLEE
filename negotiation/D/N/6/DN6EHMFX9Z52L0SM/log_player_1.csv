"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept immediately. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd prefer to sell to him and avoid selling to John, I need to get closer to my minimum price.  I'll counter with a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering the price from my initial offer to $125. This is still above my minimum of $150, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, but he's showing some willingness to compromise. I'll counter again to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I'm hoping that by consistently lowering my offer, I can convince Bob to raise his own and we can find a price we're both comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with it. I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob, and I'll counter once more before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price one more time, but only slightly. I'm hoping this small concession will convince Bob to meet me halfway and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to my minimum, but I'm running out of rounds.  With only two left, the risk of Bob rejecting my next offer and me losing out on a sale is too high. It's time to take the guaranteed $150 from John."
