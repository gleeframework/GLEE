"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Considering its value and quality, I propose a special introductory price of $10,000 for you. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a product worth more than $8,000 to you at a price that is still significantly higher than what it costs me. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is less than the product's worth to her, it's still significantly more than your maximum budget and what John is offering. By rejecting this offer, you can move forward with purchasing from John at a price that aligns with your budget."
