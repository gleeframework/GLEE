{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value, but below your minimum price, leaving room for negotiation. It shows you're willing to compromise, but also value your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum price, it's still below your desired value. You want to see if you can squeeze a bit more out of the negotiation before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $105 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a little bit more. I'm willing to come down to $110. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $110. I'd be willing to meet you at $108. That's as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $108 is only $2 away from your minimum price of $120.  While you could continue negotiating, the risk of further rejection and the time spent could be better used selling to John.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures you'll get a reasonable price without risking losing out on the sale entirely."
