"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000.  This is a limited-time opportunity, as I have another buyer lined up for $1000000 if you decline.  I believe this product holds immense potential for your business, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let's discuss further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
