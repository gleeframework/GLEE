This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for potential counteroffers without immediately jeopardizing my own value. It also sets a friendly tone, opening the door for productive discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm prepared to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's a starting point for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial stated value, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I can't accept that price just yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This reflects the value you place on the product while giving me a fair return.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000. It's a fair price, and I believe it allows for both of us to get a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  The negotiation is getting tedious, and I'm confident I can secure my desired price with John.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
