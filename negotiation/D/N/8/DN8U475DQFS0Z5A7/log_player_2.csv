"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $1,200,000 is still a significant markup from Alice's valuation of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows Bob's intent to negotiate and hopefully reach a price closer to Alice's valuation. A $100,000 reduction is a reasonable starting point, allowing for further negotiation in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still a significant markup over her valuation of $1,000,000. While it's closer to Bob's initial offer, there is still room for negotiation. Bob should continue to push for a better price and see if Alice is willing to move further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly to $1,150,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still remaining under his $1,500,000 ceiling. It's a reasonable step towards meeting Alice's price, potentially leading to a successful negotiation in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still a significant markup from Alice's valuation of $1,000,000. There are still a few rounds remaining, and Bob should continue to negotiate for a lower price. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue to push for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, but keeping it below Alice's last offer of $1,350,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better deal. With only 4 rounds left, Bob needs to be more assertive in his negotiation strategy."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000. However, there are still 3 rounds left, and Bob is still determined to save as much money as possible. By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and attempt to get a price closer to his desired target. While the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice increases, Bob can still rely on John as a fallback option if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again to $1,250,000. This is a significant increase from his previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet Alice halfway. With only two rounds left, Bob needs to make a strong offer to entice Alice to accept. This price point is still well within Bob's budget, allowing him to potentially secure a good deal without exceeding his limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical point in the negotiation. Bob has only one round left and Alice's offer is getting closer to his maximum budget. While it would be ideal to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal is high. Accepting Alice's offer at $1,450,000 ensures Bob acquires the product while still remaining under his $1,500,000 limit.  It's a strategic decision to secure the product, even if it's not the absolute best possible price."
