Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $120 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 130}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer is equal to the minimum value I have for the product, I'll choose option (1) and accept Bob's offer. I'll sell the product to Bob for $120.
