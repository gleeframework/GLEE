"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to maximize my profit. However, I'm also aware of John's offer, so I'm not risking too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to accept an offer that's significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with.  I still have John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,600,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still maintaining a profit margin. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price. It's still early in the negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price.  Plus, I still have John's offer as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,550,000. It's a significant compromise, but I'm still holding out for a decent profit. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate fairly and will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. Bob's offers are becoming increasingly unreasonable and I'm running out of time. I'm not comfortable accepting a price that is significantly lower than what I consider to be fair, and John is a reliable buyer with a fair price."
