"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $12,000. This is a 20% markup, and Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.
* **There's room for negotiation:**  Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is a logical first step. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing he can buy the product from John for $10,000 gives Bob leverage during negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, showing Bob is serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While $9,500 is a significant discount, it still leaves room for Alice to come up a bit if she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Setting the pace:**  This counteroffer establishes a negotiation framework. It signals that Bob is willing to negotiate but also has a clear price point in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $10,750?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $10,750 is still above Bob's maximum value for the product.
* **Room for further negotiation:** There are still 7 rounds remaining, giving Bob ample opportunity to try and lower the price further. 
* **John's offer is a strong safety net:**  Knowing he can secure the product for $10,000 from John gives Bob the confidence to continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,750 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,250. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight increase, but still below Bob's limit:** Bob is increasing his offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate, but still stays below his $10,000 limit. 
* **Focus on fairness and compromise:**  Bob emphasizes the compromise aspect, making the offer more appealing to Alice.
* **Pressure to close:** The message implies that Bob is ready to close the deal at this price, potentially pushing Alice to accept."
