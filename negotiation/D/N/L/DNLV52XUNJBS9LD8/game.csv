"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $10,750?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts!",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,750 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,250. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make it happen.",10250.0,Bob,4,
