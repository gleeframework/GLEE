"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""value and potential,"" I'm aiming to justify the high price and appeal to Bob's understanding of its worth. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear this is a starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **John as Backup:** While I have John as a backup, my goal is to maximize profit. Settling for John's offer too early would be leaving a significant amount of money on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is substantial, it's still a significant difference from my target. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be leaving too much potential profit on the table at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is certainly a respectable offer, it doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $1,300,000, I'm proposing a compromise that shows flexibility while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to ensure Bob understands it's not an arbitrary number. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  The goal is to keep the negotiation moving forward and signal my willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to finalize a deal closer to $1,250,000. This price would represent a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a significant profit margin above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently moved closer to my asking price, demonstrating his seriousness about the purchase.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate for a potentially small increase in price carries the risk of losing the deal altogether. The longer the negotiation drags on, the more likely it is that something could change, or Bob might find an alternative. 
* **Bird in Hand:** Securing a good offer now is generally preferable to chasing a potentially slightly better outcome later."
