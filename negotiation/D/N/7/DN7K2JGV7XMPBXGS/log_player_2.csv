"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good starting point, Bob can likely get a better price.  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price, showcasing Bob's seriousness about getting a good deal. It's a bold move that will push Alice to either accept or counter with a more reasonable price.
* **Within Bob's Budget:** This price is well within Bob's $1,500,000 budget, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Fair to Alice:** While a significant reduction, the offer is still above Alice's value of $1,000,000, making it a potentially acceptable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is certainly a respectable offer, it doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,300,000 is a better price than the initial $1,400,000,  it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  There's still room to negotiate and potentially get closer to his target of $1,200,000.  

Bob can use this opportunity to further demonstrate his willingness to negotiate while staying within his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to finalize a deal closer to $1,250,000. This price would represent a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:**  Bob is now moving slightly towards Alice's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Close to Target:**  This counteroffer is still within Bob's goal of saving as much money as possible.
* **Pressure on Alice:** This offer puts pressure on Alice to either accept or offer a counter-counteroffer that's more appealing to Bob.
* **Potential for Agreement:**  It's possible that Alice will accept this offer, as it's closer to her own valuation of the product.

By continuing to negotiate with Alice, Bob is increasing the chances of securing a favorable deal, while still having the option to purchase from John as a backup plan."
