"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This is my final offer, as I have another option for acquiring this product.",800000.0,Bob,4,
