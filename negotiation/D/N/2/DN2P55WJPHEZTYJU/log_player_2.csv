"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth exploring if a better deal can be reached with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks Alice, I appreciate your offer.  However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and giving you a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. After reconsidering, I'm willing to offer you the product for $10,800. This is still a good compromise, considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,800 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still a bit higher than what he's willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get closer to his target price of $10,000.  It's also important to remember that Bob can always choose to buy from John if he's not happy with Alice's final offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,200 for the product. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,200. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to offer you the product for $10,600. This is a fair compromise, considering the benefits the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price, $10,600 is still above Bob's ideal budget. With only 5 rounds left, Bob needs to be careful. He can continue to negotiate with Alice, but the risk is that she may refuse to budge further and he'll be forced to either accept a price he's not comfortable with or buy from John. This is a difficult decision, but  rejecting and counter-offering again is a reasonable strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $10,600 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $10,200.  This is a fair price for both of us and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but if we can't reach a deal, I will have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 10200}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,200. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $10,400. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, but $10,400 is still above Bob's target price. With only 3 rounds left, it's worth attempting one more counteroffer to see if Alice will budge.  If she refuses, Bob can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,400 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to offer you $10,300. This is my final offer, and it's a good deal for both of us.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 10300}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm not willing to accept $10,300. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $10,350. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling the product to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,350
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, as $10,350 is very close to Bob's target price. However, with only one round left, the risk of Alice rejecting Bob's final counteroffer and leaving him with no deal is high.  

Given that Bob can secure the product from John for $10,000, it's the safer option.  While it's slightly more expensive than Alice's final offer, it guarantees Bob gets the product and avoids the risk of a negotiation breakdown."
