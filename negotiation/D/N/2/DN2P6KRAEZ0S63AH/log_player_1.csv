Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product.  I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to create a good rapport with Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm ending with a question, which invites Bob to respond and potentially start a counteroffer process. 

**Strategy:** By starting high, I can gauge Bob's interest and hopefully secure a price closer to my ideal value. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and proceed accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell. I believe there's potential to get closer to my initial asking price of $100. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Show I'm not desperate:**  This demonstrates I'm not willing to settle for the bare minimum. 
* **Open a negotiation:**  It allows me to counteroffer and potentially reach a compromise closer to my desired value.

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial $100, but higher than his offer. I'll aim for a price around $90, giving him a chance to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about $90?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering $90, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows willingness to negotiate but also maintains a price higher than my minimum.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language (""great deal,"" ""closer to what I need"") to keep the tone friendly and encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer (""It's still a great deal for you""). This makes my offer more appealing to Bob and can help build a case for a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is only $5 less than my desired price and is significantly higher than John's offer.  It's a good deal for me considering the negotiation process and Bob's potential to walk away. 

Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Close to Desired Price:**  $85 is within a reasonable range of my initial asking price and my minimum acceptable price.
* **Avoid Potential Loss:** Rejecting the offer could lead to further negotiation, risking a lower price or even Bob abandoning the deal. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to John for $80 represents a guaranteed sale, but it's also a lower profit.  

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a swift sale and a good profit, minimizing risk and maximizing potential earnings."
