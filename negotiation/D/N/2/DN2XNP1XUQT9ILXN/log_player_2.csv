"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price given its value to me and your desired selling point."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is cutting it a bit close. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and closer to my desired price point. Accepting this offer saves me $1,000 compared to buying from John."
