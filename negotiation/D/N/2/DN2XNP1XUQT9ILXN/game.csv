"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price given its value to me and your desired selling point.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is cutting it a bit close. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
