Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I recommend:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus you can negotiate for.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to get more than $1,000,000.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and based on my understanding of its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning**

* **Targeting the Surplus:** This price aims to split the $200,000 surplus almost evenly, giving you a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Strong but Fair:**  The price is high enough to maximize your profit but not so high that Bob is likely to dismiss it outright. 
* **Clear and Concise Message:** The message is direct and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (e.g., $1,125,000) to give yourself more room to negotiate.
* **Relationship Value:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a more balanced offer might be preferred. 

**Remember:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He may counter-offer, or you might need to adjust your price slightly."
