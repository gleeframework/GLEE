"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if you can get a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message is framed politely to maintain a positive negotiation tone. I haven't outright rejected her offer but expressed that it's not feasible for me.
* **Strategic Goal:** My goal is to buy the product for under $80.  By starting at $65, I'm aiming to steer the negotiation closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $90.  This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price.  Let's work together to make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's counteroffer of $90 is closer to my budget but still above the $80 I can get it from John.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are still several rounds left, suggesting room for further negotiation with Alice. 
* **Potential for Compromise:**  Alice seems motivated to sell, and I believe there's a chance we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $75? I think that's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  By proposing $75, I'm splitting the difference between Alice's current offer ($90) and my previous counteroffer ($65). This is a common negotiation tactic that can signal a willingness to compromise.
* **Within Budget, But Room to Negotiate:**  $75 is still within my target range, but it leaves some room for Alice to potentially counter with a price slightly lower than $80.
* **Direct and Clear:** The message directly suggests a compromise price and highlights its fairness to both parties, encouraging a quick agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 is just not enough for me.  Let's meet halfway again - I'll offer you the product for $85.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **John's Offer is Better:** Alice has come down to $85, but John's offer of $80 is still more favorable. 
* **Limited Time and Potential Savings:**  There's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and with only 5 rounds remaining, I risk missing out on John's guaranteed lower price.
* **Prioritizing Savings:** My primary goal is to save money, and John's offer accomplishes that directly. 

While there's a slight chance of negotiating a better price with Alice, the guaranteed savings from John outweigh the potential risk of continuing the negotiation."
