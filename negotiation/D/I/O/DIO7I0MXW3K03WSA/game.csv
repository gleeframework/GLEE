"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm aiming for a price closer to $850,000, considering the value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. ",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a price closer to $850,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price.  How about $875,000? I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer that benefits both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go above $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $885,000. I think this is the best compromise we can reach without going below my minimum price of $800,000 for a sale to John.",885000.0,Alice,5,
