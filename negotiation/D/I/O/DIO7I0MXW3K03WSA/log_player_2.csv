"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's value for the product. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm aiming for a price closer to $850,000, considering the value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than Alice's value for the product. This is a strategic move to create room for negotiation while showing a genuine interest in the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to $850,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's desired price. Bob is aiming for a price closer to $850,000. By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price.  How about $875,000? I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate by offering a price that's halfway between his previous offer and Alice's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to meet in the middle while still pursuing a favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go above $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $885,000. I think this is the best compromise we can reach without going below my minimum price of $800,000 for a sale to John. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer is very close to Bob's desired price of $850,000. 
* **Saving Money:** Accepting this offer saves Bob $115,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, Bob needs to consider the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price.

While further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, the risk of losing the deal and the significant saving compared to John's offer makes accepting Alice's offer the most practical decision."
