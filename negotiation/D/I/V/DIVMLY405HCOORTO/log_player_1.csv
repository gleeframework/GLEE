{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we're still leaving a significant amount of money on the table. We are willing to negotiate, but we need to hold firm to get a better price. We'll aim for a smaller concession in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've reviewed our previous discussions and am willing to offer $1,325,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While we could likely push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is a reasonable compromise. It exceeds our minimum acceptable price and allows us to close the deal now rather than risking further negotiation or losing Bob as a buyer."
