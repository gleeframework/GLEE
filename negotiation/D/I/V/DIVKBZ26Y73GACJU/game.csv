"Alice, that's a great product but $22,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. While I recognize your interest, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  Let me know what you think.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $19,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $15,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,
