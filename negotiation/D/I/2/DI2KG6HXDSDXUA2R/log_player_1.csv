Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $2,300,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I think it's a fair price considering the market value and my financial constraints.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to a deal, but $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned earlier.

While Bob is getting closer to my acceptable range, it's unlikely he'll reach it. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer to avoid potentially wasting more time and getting a lower offer from Bob."
