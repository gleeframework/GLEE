Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to my business, but I need to be realistic about my budget. I'm willing to offer $500,000.  This leaves plenty of room for us to negotiate a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a new price of $900,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit while giving you a better deal than my initial offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? This would be a great deal for me and still give you a good return on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $850,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}"
