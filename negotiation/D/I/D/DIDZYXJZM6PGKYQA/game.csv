"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still a good price point for you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I believe we can find a price closer to my budget. How about we aim for $950000 for the product? I hope this suggestion is within your consideration.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm open to finding a middle ground, $950000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $975000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and am willing to meet somewhere in between. How about considering $960000 for the product? This would allow us to move forward while staying close to my budget.",960000.0,Bob,4,
