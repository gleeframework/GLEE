"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,800,000. It's a steal for the value it offers. Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,800,000) to leave room for negotiation. Since I don't know Bob's value, I want to maximize my potential profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and positive tone might encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:** Mentioning the ""incredible value"" suggests that the price is justified and might make Bob think about the product's worth. 

**Note:** This is just my initial offer. I'll need to adapt my strategy based on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation.  I'll be ready to either accept or reject counteroffers, while keeping the fallback option of selling to John for $1,200,000 in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. Considering the market value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1500000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still $300,000 below my starting point.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Selling to John right now would secure a decent profit, but I believe I can push for more with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer in Round 3, aiming for a price closer to my ideal point. I'll also consider the market value and try to understand Bob's financial constraints to formulate a compelling offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. While I acknowledge the market value, this product is truly unique and offers exceptional potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This price reflects both the product's quality and the value it can deliver to you. Let's find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm reducing my price by $150,000 from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Uniqueness:**  Emphasizing the product's ""exceptional potential"" and ""uniqueness"" might convince Bob that it's worth a higher price.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  The phrase ""find a solution that benefits us both"" reinforces a collaborative approach and encourages Bob to see the value in reaching an agreement.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to strike a balance between getting a good price and maintaining a positive relationship with Bob.  My counteroffer is still significantly higher than my minimum, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'll continue to assess Bob's responses and adapt my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I understand the value you're placing on the product, but given my budget constraints, I'd like to propose a price of $1600000. I believe this strikes a balance between the product's value and what I am able to afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the Deal:** Bob's offer is very close to my counteroffer, and it's within the range I'm comfortable with.  
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to further rejection and a lower final price. Accepting Bob's offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of a stalemate.
* **Time is Money:**  Each round spent negotiating is time lost.  Accepting a reasonable offer helps me maximize my earnings in the long run.

**Note:** While I could potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, I'm prioritizing closing the deal and securing a solid profit."
