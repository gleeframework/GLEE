"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000,  which reflects a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still a bit far from your offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,012,500?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will make this a win-win situation.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
