"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This offer represents a substantial saving compared to your estimated value, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000.  You have room to negotiate or see if Alice will lower her price."
