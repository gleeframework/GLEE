Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $16,000. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $16,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product for less from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, but he shouldn't be afraid to walk away and buy from John if he needs to."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really only able to pay $14,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I can do $15,500, which is a good compromise between our two prices. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Even though Alice is getting closer to his price, $15,500 is still over his budget. John is offering a price that fits within his budget, so it's the best option for him at this point."
