"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500.  That gives you a good price while still allowing me to get a reasonable return on my investment.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
