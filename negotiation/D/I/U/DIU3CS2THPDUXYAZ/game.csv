"Alice, your product is interesting but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if this works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $12,000 is a fair price, I'm hoping for a bit more to reflect the value I see in this product.  How about $13,500?  That would be a good compromise and still give you a great deal.  Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However, $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept.",12500.0,Bob,4,
