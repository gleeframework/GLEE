"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $170 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $155. Let me know what you think.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $155 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $140. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal.",140.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $147.50. This is the lowest I can go and still make a reasonable profit.",147.5,Alice,5,
