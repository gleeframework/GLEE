"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. It comes with a range of features that promise to enhance your experience significantly. Considering its quality and the benefits it offers, I would like to propose a price of $150 for this exceptional item. Thank you for considering my offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Since you're willing to pay a maximum of $150, and John is offering the product at that price, it makes the most sense to buy from John. There's no potential to save money by negotiating with Alice."
