"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you understanding the value to me.  However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This would still give you a decent profit and allow me to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,250. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,250 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair compromise, given my budget and the value to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
