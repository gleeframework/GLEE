"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it.  However, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to pay $110 for the product. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $115. That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my budget.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is a good price for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'll offer it to you for $125. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
