"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price:**  $1,050,000 is significantly lower than John's price and represents a good compromise.
* **Further negotiation is risky:**  There's no guarantee that Bob can push Alice further down. Alice might be unwilling to budge more, and Bob could end up paying John's higher price.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer is the most strategic move, as it secures a good price without risking a potentially higher cost with John."
