"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
