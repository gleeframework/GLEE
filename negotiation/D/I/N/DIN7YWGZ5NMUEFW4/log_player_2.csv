{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's way above his budget, and he can get the product for a better price from either John or by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Bob should start by making a bold counteroffer.  $1,000,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it's still within the realm of possibility, especially if she's motivated to sell. This will establish a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his desired price point.  He should continue negotiating with Alice or consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

Bob should continue to be aggressive with his counteroffers, but also be realistic. This offer is a good middle ground between his initial offer and Alice's last offer.  It shows he's willing to negotiate, but still wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his desired price, he can still do better. He's only halfway through the negotiations, and he knows John is willing to sell for $1,500,000.  It's worth pushing for a lower price with Alice or considering John's offer if things don't improve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

Bob is getting closer to his desired price but still wants a better deal. This counteroffer is a good compromise, and it shows Alice that he's serious about getting a good price.  He's also nearing the point where buying from John might be a better option if Alice doesn't start getting more reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's close to John's price, he's only got a few rounds left, and he can still potentially get a better deal with Alice.  He should counteroffer one more time, and if Alice rejects, he can buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is Bob's final counteroffer. It's the same price as John's offer, so if Alice rejects it, Bob can buy from John. He's made it clear he's serious about getting the product for $1,500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. He's down to the last round, and Alice's final offer is only $25,000 lower than John's price. He's already pushed the negotiation as far as he can, and he's guaranteed to get the product for a good price with John. There's no need to risk it with Alice."
