"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider my offer?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I have to make a living, and $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're serious about the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, which is my minimum price. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,5,
