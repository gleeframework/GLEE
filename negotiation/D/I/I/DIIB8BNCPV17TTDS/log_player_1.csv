Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but hopefully encourages him to accept quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $900,000 is too low for me, especially since I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to him. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,100,000. This is a compromise, but still above Bob's initial offer, and closer to the value I know the product holds for him. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  I want to see if we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but still reflects the value of the product to both of us. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to come up to my desired price, and I've already lowered my offer significantly. At this point, I'm not sure we'll ever come to an agreement.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's a sure thing and saves me the time and effort of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
