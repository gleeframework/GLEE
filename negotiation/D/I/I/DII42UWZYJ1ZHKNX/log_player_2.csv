Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I can only go as high as $875,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're committed to acquiring this product, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell the product to you for $885,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is only $85,000 over my budget. This is a significant compromise from her initial price and represents a good deal for me.  While I could continue negotiating, I risk losing the product and having to purchase from John at a higher price. Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most prudent decision."
