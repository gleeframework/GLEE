Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches the minimum price we're willing to accept. However, we also have John ready to buy the product for the same price.  

Since there's no financial advantage to continuing negotiations with Bob, and the potential for a better offer from him is uncertain, it makes the most business sense to sell to John immediately. This guarantees us our desired price and avoids the risk of extended negotiations."
