Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $1,250,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  $1,280,000 is getting close, but I'm still a bit short.  To make this work, I need to be at $1,295,000. It's a small difference, and it would give us both a fair deal.  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for your business.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very slowly lowering her price. At this rate, it's unlikely she'll go below $1,280,000, and might even end up closer to $1,290,000. John offers a guaranteed price of $1,200,000, which saves us more money. It's time to cut the negotiation with Alice short and go with John's offer."
