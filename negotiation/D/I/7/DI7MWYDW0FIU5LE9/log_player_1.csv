Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to make a special offer just for you. Would you be interested in purchasing the product for $14,000?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob values the product at $8,000, Alice is unaware of his upper limit. Starting with a price closer to her own value ($14,000) leaves room for negotiation and potential profit above John's offer.
* **Gauge Interest:** The ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""special offer"" phrasing aims to pique Bob's interest and position the price as a potential bargain.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 doesn't necessarily mean Alice won't accept slightly less. It sets a strong starting point while leaving room for Bob to counter-offer if he's highly motivated.

**Important Note:** There's always the risk Bob will reject the offer outright. However, by starting higher, Alice maximizes her potential gain if Bob is willing to negotiate closer to her desired price."
