"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate it. I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $130? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. Let's split the difference and go with $115. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can agree on it.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $125? I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to give you a good deal.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you being flexible. I'm still not quite ready to go to $125. Let's meet in the middle at $120. If you're willing to go that low, I'm ready to make the purchase.",120.0,Bob,6,
