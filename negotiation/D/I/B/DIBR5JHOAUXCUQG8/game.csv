"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  To make this work, I could come down to $19,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $19,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
