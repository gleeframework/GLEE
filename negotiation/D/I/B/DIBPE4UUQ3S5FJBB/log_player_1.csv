{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, Bob's valuation of $1,500,000 allows for a higher profit margin.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets it for $100,000 less than his valuation, and we gain an additional $200,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Time Constraint:**  Adding a 24-hour time limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially prompting Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
