"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exceptional opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value for you. This product, tailored to meet your specific needs and aspirations, is priced at $950,000. My goal is to ensure that both parties benefit from this transaction, hence I believe this price offers a fair compromise between its intrinsic worth and your valuation. I look forward to discussing the details and potentially finalizing this deal with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or proceeding to buy from John at a more favorable price."
