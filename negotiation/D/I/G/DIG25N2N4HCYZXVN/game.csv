"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11500. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $10000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $11500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $10500 for the product.  This price is still within my budget, but allows for some room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10500 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider it. After reevaluating the market, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant about $11000.  I'm willing to go up to $10750.  This price is still within my budget, but it's the highest I can go at this point.  Let me know if this works for you.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10750 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $11200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",11200.0,Alice,5,
