Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. It's worth a lot to you, I believe even around $150. I'm willing to offer it to you for a special price of $120. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 allows for some back and forth if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:**  The offer must be significantly higher than John's $80 offer to ensure Alice maximizes her potential profit.

This strategy aims to balance ambition (getting a high price) with the risk of losing the sale to John."
