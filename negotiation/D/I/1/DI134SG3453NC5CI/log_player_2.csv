"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire [Product Name] at a price significantly below its true market value.  While I value this product at $1,500,000, I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This represents a substantial savings for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it offers.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another potential buyer ready to pay full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has a strong incentive to push the price as high as possible. Her mention of another buyer is likely a tactic to pressure you. 
* **Your Best Alternative:** You know John will sell you the product for $800,000. This is your fallback option and sets a clear upper limit on what you should pay. 
* **Potential Savings:**  By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of getting the product for $400,000 less than her current asking price. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Alice's offer, you force her to either:

1. **Lower her price:**  She might be bluffing about the other buyer and would rather make a deal with you than lose the sale.
2. **Walk away:**  If she's truly confident in the other buyer, she might let you go. In this case, you buy from John as planned."
