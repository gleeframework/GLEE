# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product at a competitive price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a lower price with Alice or find another seller offering a better deal."
