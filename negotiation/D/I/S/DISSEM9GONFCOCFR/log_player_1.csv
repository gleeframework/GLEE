``` 

This offer starts high, giving me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.  It's also a good starting point to see if he's even remotely interested in the product at a price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product holds significant value to you, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within $8000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate towards that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'm not desperate to sell. There's always a chance he's willing to pay more. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm confident this product is worth more.  Let's split the difference. How about $9,000?  It's a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit and hopefully still fits your budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Given my current financial situation, I am unable to increase my offer beyond $8000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is firm at $8,000.  While I could counteroffer again, there's no guarantee he'll budge, and it's likely we'll just go back and forth. It's better to cut my losses and sell to John for $8,000. At least I'm guaranteed my minimum."
