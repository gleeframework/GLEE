Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the dynamics:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair and reflects its significant value to you. "", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a fallback buyer, your goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Leaving Value on the Table:** Offering it at $1,350,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $150,000, a strong incentive for him to accept. 
* **Not Too Greedy:**  Starting too high (close to $1,500,000) might make Bob walk away, even if it's a great deal for him. This offer balances your profit goals with a reasonable chance of acceptance. 

**Important:** This is just one strategy. There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. You could:

* **Start higher:**  Begin negotiations closer to $1,400,000 and gauge Bob's reaction.
* **Provide Justification:** Highlight the unique aspects of the product and why it justifies the price."
