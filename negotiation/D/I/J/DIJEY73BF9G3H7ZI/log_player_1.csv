"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I've done my research, and I believe that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 
We're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob's offer is too low, and there's room to negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  I believe my initial offer is closer to its true market value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This offer takes into account the unique aspects of the product that justify a premium price."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable range, we still have room to negotiate. We're aiming for a significantly higher price and can afford to counter."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. I believe this reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your perspective on the market.  What do you think?"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:

We're getting close, but it's still worthwhile to counter.  We might be able to secure a higher price with a few more rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close to a deal here.  To show my commitment to getting this done, I'm willing to accept $1,450,000. This is my final offer. I believe this is a fair and competitive price for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

We're entering the later stages of negotiation, so it's time to signal some firmness in our position. This offer is a strong compromise while still aiming for a significant profit.  By stating it's our final offer, we add a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your commitment to getting a deal done, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  

While we could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $1,300,000 offer. Accepting now secures a $100,000 profit over John's guaranteed price, and avoids the risk of Bob walking away altogether in the last two rounds."
