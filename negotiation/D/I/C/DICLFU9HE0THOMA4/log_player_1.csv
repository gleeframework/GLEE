{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $8,000.  

While I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob, we're at a point where I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but Bob isn't moving significantly. To avoid the risk of getting stuck in a stalemate with Bob and losing out on a sale, I'm going to secure the deal with John. This guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids further potential losses from continued negotiation."
