{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a good price, I can likely do better. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,000,000 is tempting, it's a bit below what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value you'll get from the product, and it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm not ready to sell for that price yet. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your budget constraints.  While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a bit more. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that considers both our positions.  Let's settle on this amount and finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my target, Alice. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, it seems Bob is firmly set on $980,000.  Considering that John is willing to pay $800,000, selling to John guarantees a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might lead to a lower price."
