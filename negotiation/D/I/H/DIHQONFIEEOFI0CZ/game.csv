"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. The value this product brings is substantial.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product.  However,  $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits I see in the product. I hope you'll consider my offer.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
