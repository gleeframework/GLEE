Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,050,000 is still too low for me.  How about we settle on $1,075,000? This would be a fair compromise, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with.

This offer from Alice is close enough to the price from John that you can accept it. You save $25,000 compared to John, and there's no guarantee that you'll be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
