I'm starting with a high offer of $1,700,000. This is above Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is a good starting point to maximize my profit while still leaving room for a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is still above Bob's valuation but closer to his offer, showing my willingness to negotiate while trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I want.  It's becoming a bit of a risk to keep negotiating, and I'm worried I might not get a better offer from him. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, so I'm going to take the safe route and sell to him."
