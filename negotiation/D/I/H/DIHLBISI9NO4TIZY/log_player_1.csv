"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product, I'll start with a relatively high price.

{""product_price"": 150}

I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to pay at least $150 for the product, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $120 is equal to the minimum value I'm willing to accept, I'll choose option (1) and accept Bob's offer. I'll sell the product to Bob for $120.
