"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $900,000, while John is asking for $1,000,000. 
* **You're still getting a good deal:**  The product is worth $1,000,000 to you, so paying $900,000 saves you $100,000. 

It's always advantageous to accept a lower price, even if it's only slightly lower, when you have an alternative option that is more expensive."
