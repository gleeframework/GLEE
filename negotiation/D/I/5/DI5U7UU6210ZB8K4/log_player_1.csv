Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. Let me know what you think.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I could go up to $725,000. That's a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see that we're getting closer. While $837,500 is closer to what I can do, it's still a bit of a stretch. I'd be willing to settle at $780,000. This would be a significant investment for me, but I believe it's a fair price that respects the value of your product.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently moving in small increments and is still significantly below a price that would be acceptable (remember, the product is worth $1,200,000 to you).  John represents a guaranteed sale at your desired price.  It's time to cut your losses with Bob and move on to the guaranteed sale."
