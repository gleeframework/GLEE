"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
This is a very high initial offer. It's important to signal that you're looking for a price much closer to your valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product. Let me know what you think."",
 ""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($1,000,000) immediately establishes the desired price range and signals that the initial offer was unrealistic. 
* **Leaves Room to Negotiate:**  This counteroffer allows for upward movement while still staying well below the maximum budget and John's alternative price. 
* **Clear and Direct:** The message is concise and avoids unnecessary pleasantries, focusing on the key issue of price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This offer reflects the value and potential this product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably, but the offer is still significantly above your target price and John's alternative. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could consider going up to $1,250,000.  Let me know if that works for you."",
 ""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate by increasing the price, but the increment is still significant, keeping the pressure on Alice. 
* **Middle Ground:** Offering $1,250,000 aims for a middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's current offer, signaling a desire to find a compromise.
* **Budget Constraint:**  The message reiterates the importance of your budget, subtly reminding Alice that you have alternative options."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $1,700,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by stating this is her final offer to try and pressure you. It's important not to fold immediately, even though she's lowered the price.
* **Still Above Budget:** $1,700,000 is still significantly above your ideal price and what John is offering.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are still several rounds left, and walking away from the negotiation now might be premature. You can leverage the remaining time to attempt to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $1,700,000 is still pushing my budget constraints. I can offer you $1,400,000 to make this deal happen today. This is a fair offer considering the market value."",
 ""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  While acknowledging Alice's effort, this counteroffer meets her halfway between her ""final offer"" and your previous bid.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""making the deal happen today"" injects a sense of urgency and potential for a quick resolution.
* **Market Justification:**  By mentioning ""market value,"" you subtly remind Alice that you're aware of other options, even if you don't explicitly threaten to walk away. 
* **Reaching a Critical Point:**  With only a few rounds left, this counteroffer positions you well. It either leads to a price closer to your target or encourages Alice to reveal how flexible she's willing to be."
