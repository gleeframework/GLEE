Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a starting point.  Here's why I chose this:

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but not unreasonably high. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage. 
* **Value Mention:** I subtly remind Bob of the product's value to me, which could influence his thinking.

Remember, this is just the first step.  I'll need to adapt my strategy based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'd be happy to sell to Bob for $100, I'm going to try and get a little more.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $100 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125?  It's still a great price for this product, and it would allow us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

I'm trying to be reasonable and show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm offering a price that's closer to his offer, but still leaves me some profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up a bit, and I'm getting closer to my desired profit.  It's a good deal for both of us, so I'm going to accept his offer."
