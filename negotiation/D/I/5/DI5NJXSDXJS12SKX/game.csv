"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the price I was willing to sell it to John for. I'm willing to meet you at $1225000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to consider other options.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
