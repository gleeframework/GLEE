Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob will pay a premium. Starting high allows room for negotiation if needed.
* **Psychology:** Offering a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value might make him think the product is even more valuable. Even if he doesn't accept the initial offer, it sets the stage for a potentially higher counter-offer. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can always fall back on selling to John for my minimum acceptable price."
