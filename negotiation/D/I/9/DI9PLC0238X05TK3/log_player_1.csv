Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $130. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering a price closer to Bob's valuation maximizes your potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the $130 offer leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $80 to John, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob. 

By starting with a strong offer, you increase your chances of securing a deal that's significantly more profitable than your fallback option."
