"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm aiming high initially to leave room for negotiation while staying within a range that's profitable for me. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value and potential,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth to him ($1,500,000) without revealing my knowledge of that specific figure. 
* **Politeness and Openness:**  The tone is positive and suggests a willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to engage further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good profit, I believe I can negotiate a better deal with Bob. There are still 8 rounds left, and his counteroffer suggests he's willing to pay a significant amount. It's worth continuing the negotiation for a potentially higher return."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. To find a middle ground, how about we settle on $1,275,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I've come down from my initial offer by $75,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still aiming for a price significantly above his counteroffer. 
* **Justification:** By saying ""to find a middle ground,"" I'm subtly anchoring the negotiation around a price point closer to my desired outcome. 
* **Maintaining Positivity:**  The tone remains respectful and collaborative, encouraging Bob to continue the discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the market value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,250,000 represents a significant profit margin above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000). 
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob's latest offer, combined with his message about ""budget constraints,"" suggests he might not be willing to go much higher.
* **Time Value:** While more rounds remain, securing a deal now eliminates the risk of Bob walking away or further prolonged negotiations."
