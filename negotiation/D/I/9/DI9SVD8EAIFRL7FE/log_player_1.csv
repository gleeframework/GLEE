"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I have 10 rounds and can always sell to John, so I will try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is still quite low.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a good deal. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Bob has raised his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not in a rush to sell, and I have the option of selling to John for a much higher price. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping he'll come closer to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still too far from what I need to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This would be a fair compromise, and it would give you a great deal on a valuable product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I truly appreciate your efforts to reach a deal, but $10,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm going to offer a final price of $9,750. This reflects my maximum willingness to pay and represents a significant concession from my previous offer. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $9,750 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I have 4 rounds remaining, but with the possibility of selling to John for $15,000, it's simply not worth risking a lower price. I'll take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
