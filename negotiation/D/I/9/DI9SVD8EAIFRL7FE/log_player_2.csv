"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my maximum price of $8,000. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is still quite low.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a good deal. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target, it's still above my desired price. I'll continue to counteroffer and see if I can get her to come down even further. There are still several rounds left, and I don't want to rush into a deal that's not within my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still too far from what I need to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This would be a fair compromise, and it would give you a great deal on a valuable product. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above my target price of $8,000. I'm determined to get the best possible deal, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. There are still a few rounds left, and I believe I can convince Alice to lower her price further. I also have the option of buying from John for $8,000, but I want to exhaust all possibilities with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your efforts to reach a deal, but $10,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm going to offer a final price of $9,750. This reflects my maximum willingness to pay and represents a significant concession from my previous offer. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9750}
