"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,800. I'm interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,800 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I can't go lower than $9,200. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $9,200 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I would love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise and is significantly more than what I'd get from John. It's a reasonable price given the value the product holds for Bob, and it's within a range I'm comfortable with.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
