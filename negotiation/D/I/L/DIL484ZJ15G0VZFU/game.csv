"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. How about $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While $120 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Could you do $80? That would be fantastic.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to sell it to you for $80, Bob. That's below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. How about $110? It's a fair price for a great product like this.",110.0,Alice,5,
