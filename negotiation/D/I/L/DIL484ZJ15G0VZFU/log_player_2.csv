**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown she's not willing to meet our target price. She's come down a bit, but we're still significantly apart.  It's unlikely she'll budge enough in the remaining rounds to make staying in the negotiation worthwhile. We have a guaranteed option with John at our target price, so it's time to cut our losses and go with him."
