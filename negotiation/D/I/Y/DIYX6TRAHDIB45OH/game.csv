"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, and propose a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
