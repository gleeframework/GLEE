"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900,000 is tempting, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? This would be a significant value for you, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit high for me. Could you do $950,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm open to coming down a bit further.  How about $1,000,000?  This is a significant investment for you, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on it.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
