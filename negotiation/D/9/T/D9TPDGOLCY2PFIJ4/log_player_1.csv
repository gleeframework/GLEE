{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my target price of $1,000,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, as it's the price I can get from John.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's far below my minimum acceptable price.  While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's still less than what I can get from John. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still a good deal for Bob, considering he values the product at $800,000. I'm hoping this compromise will encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $850,000. While it's still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum than my previous counteroffer, and it's a better deal than selling to John. I'm willing to accept this price to secure a sale and avoid further negotiation."
