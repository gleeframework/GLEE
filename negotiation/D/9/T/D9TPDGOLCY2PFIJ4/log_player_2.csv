It's definitely not worth buying the product from Alice at her initial price.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate a better deal."

I'm starting with my maximum price, as I'm comfortable buying from John for that amount. This will put the pressure on Alice to negotiate down from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my maximum.  I'm going to reject and try to negotiate further."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate but still remaining below my maximum. This could encourage her to meet me halfway."
