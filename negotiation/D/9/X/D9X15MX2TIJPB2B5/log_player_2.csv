"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting price is quite high. There's a good chance we can negotiate a better deal, especially since we have John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

We're starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This leaves us room to increase our offer while staying well below our maximum budget and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down a bit, but we're still aiming for a better price. We'll continue negotiating and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand the product's value, Alice, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Could we agree on $1,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

We're proposing a price that's exactly what the product is worth to Alice. This is a strong negotiating point, and it shows her we are serious about the purchase while still aiming for a good deal for ourselves."
