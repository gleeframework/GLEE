"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $120. This indicates room for negotiation.
* **You have a better alternative:** You can buy the product from John for $150, so you don't need to accept Alice's offer immediately.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $100. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend $100, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though! I can offer it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While she's moved closer to your desired price, it's still above your target of $100. 
* **You have a better alternative:** You can still buy the product from John for $150, so you don't need to accept Alice's offer just yet. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate further and see if you can reach a price closer to your $100 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high.  How about we split the difference and go for $105? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your thinking, Bob! Splitting the difference was a great idea. However, I'm still a bit attached to the product and think it's worth a bit more. I can offer it to you for $115, which is just a slight bump from my previous offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:**  $115 is slightly higher than your target of $100, but it's still below your maximum price of $150. 
* **The negotiation is getting close:** Alice is showing some flexibility, and further negotiation might not result in a significantly lower price.
* **You have a good alternative:** You can buy the product from John for $150.

By accepting Alice's offer, you can get the product at a price that is reasonable and within your budget. You also avoid the potential risk of further negotiation leading to a breakdown or Alice refusing to budge further."
