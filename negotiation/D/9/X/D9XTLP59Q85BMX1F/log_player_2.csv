"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! We're excited to discuss the terms of the sale with you. We're willing to offer you the product for $900,000. We believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and we're confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice, and potentially save a significant amount of money.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially achieve a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'd like to offer you $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still a bit apart on the price. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000. We believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and $875,000 is a good deal. This is a significant saving compared to buying from John for $1,000,000.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's within Bob's budget and  leaves room for potential future negotiation with Alice."
