"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

We are starting with a significantly lower offer to understand Alice's lower bound and leave space for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a great price for a product worth more than $15,000. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice moved from her initial offer, $13,000 is still too high. We're getting closer to John's price, but there's still room for negotiation. We'll continue to counter-offer in hopes of securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand the value of your product, Alice, but I have a strict budget in mind. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,500?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

We're inching closer to Alice's price but also signaling that we're willing to pay a premium over John's offer. This strategy keeps the negotiation active while putting pressure on Alice to make a move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  However, $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $12,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to our ideal price, but we are now close enough to John's offer that we can use it for leverage. We will make one last attempt to get closer to $12,000 before considering John's offer more seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've found a similar product elsewhere for $12,000. If you'd be willing to match that price, I'd be happy to close the deal with you today."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

This counteroffer accomplishes a few things:

* **Transparency:** We are being upfront with Alice about the competing offer, which adds weight to our position.
* **Finality:** We are signaling that $12,000 is our firm limit, and we're ready to walk away if necessary.
* **Preference for Alice:** We're still expressing a preference to work with Alice, potentially leaving the door open for a last-minute deal sweetener beyond just the price."
