"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $12,000. This gives him some room to negotiate, but still leaves me with a profit.  I'm aiming for a quick deal, but I'm also prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to accept such a low price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a great price for a product worth more than $15,000. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway, offering him a price that's closer to his offer, but still significantly above my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of your product, Alice, but I have a strict budget in mind. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my ideal price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'll make another counteroffer in the next round. I'm confident that I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  However, $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $12,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm narrowing the gap, offering a price closer to Bob's last offer, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm serious about selling to Bob, but also that I'm not willing to give away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've found a similar product elsewhere for $12,000. If you'd be willing to match that price, I'd be happy to close the deal with you today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I've reached my limit in terms of price. I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Given that John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm going to sell the product to him to avoid any further negotiation."
