Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit beyond your minimum.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly reveal the product's worth to Bob, it emphasizes ""immense value"" to justify the high price tag. 
* **Exclusivity:**  Framing the offer as ""exclusive"" adds a level of desirability and urgency. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. You are prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. The goal is to find a price point that maximizes your profit while still being enticing enough for Bob to accept."
