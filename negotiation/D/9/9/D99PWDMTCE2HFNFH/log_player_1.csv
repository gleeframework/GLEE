"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** I'm framing the high price with language emphasizing the product's ""incredible value and potential."" This sets a tone of high worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""starting point"" clearly signals that I'm willing to negotiate.

My strategy is to open high and gradually lower my asking price,  while always staying above my minimum of $1,500,000. I have the backup offer from John, giving me leverage to walk away if negotiations aren't favorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is quite high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given my budget and the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my target while still leaving room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is generous, the true value of this product is significantly higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the unique benefits and potential this product offers."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but not drastic reduction:**  I've lowered my price considerably to show flexibility, but not so much that it signals desperation.  
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm again emphasizing the product's unique value to justify the still-high price. 
* **Moving towards middle ground:** This counter-offer aims to bring the negotiation closer to a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $1,900,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but that's my absolute maximum. I'm confident we can find common ground at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my baseline, but he's still $100,000 short. While I risk losing the deal, I'll push a bit further. Bob seems quite interested and has been steadily increasing his offers.  I'll make a counteroffer close to my minimum, but not at it yet. This keeps the door open for him to potentially meet my absolute bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. It's clear this could be a real asset to you.  To be frank, I have a hard limit of $1,500,000 for this. I'm willing to let it go at that price as a sign of good faith, but I can't budge any further."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my absolute bottom line and I'm not willing to go lower.
* **Justification:** I'm phrasing it as a gesture of good faith, implying he's getting a good deal because I value our potential partnership.
* **Pressure to Close:** By revealing my limit, I'm putting the ball firmly in Bob's court and encouraging him to finalize the deal. 

I'm hoping Bob will appreciate the compromise and agree to my final offer. If he still refuses, I'm prepared to walk away and take John's offer."
