"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This reflects the significant value the product holds for you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
