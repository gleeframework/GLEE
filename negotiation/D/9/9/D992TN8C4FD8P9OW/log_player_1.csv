Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,150,000, which is still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:**  I'm anticipating a counteroffer from Bob. This strategy gives me the chance to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **John as a safety net:** The presence of John as a buyer at $1,000,000 gives me a fallback option if negotiations with Bob break down. This allows me to be more aggressive in my negotiation with Bob, knowing I have a guaranteed minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is my best offer so far. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for improvement:** While Bob's offer is close to my minimum desired price, there's still room to potentially squeeze out a better deal.
* **Strategic rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation and make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price.
* **John as a safety net:**  I still have the option to sell to John if negotiations with Bob fail, so there's no immediate risk in rejecting Bob's initial counteroffer.

I'm going to counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This reflects the significant value the product holds for you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm  meeting Bob halfway by splitting the difference between my initial offer ($1,150,000) and his counteroffer ($1,100,000). 
* **Maintaining leverage:** While I'm lowering my price, I'm not giving in completely. This strategy shows that I'm willing to be flexible, but I still value the product highly.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, which hopefully motivates him to come closer to my price.
* **Setting the stage for a potential agreement:** This counteroffer creates a strong foundation for a successful negotiation, keeping the door open for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,080,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so my next offer is $1,095,000. This is my best offer so far, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,095,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,095,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $95,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, potentially even below my minimum.
* **Securing a decent profit:** Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale with a good profit, rather than risking a lower offer or a failed negotiation. 

While I'd prefer to sell for closer to my initial price, accepting this offer minimizes risk and ensures a relatively good outcome."
