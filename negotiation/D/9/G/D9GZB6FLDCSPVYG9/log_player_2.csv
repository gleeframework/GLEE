You have three options:

The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $15,000. That's already above my maximum price of $8,000. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?

Alice has come down to $12,000, which is within my budget.  While I would prefer to pay less, I'm willing to accept this offer as it's a good deal for me, and I'm confident I can still make a profit on the product."
