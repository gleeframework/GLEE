"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $12,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  I'm confident you'll still get great value at that price.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to see eye-to-eye on this. While I appreciate your efforts, $12,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000 as a final compromise. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive from the product. Let me know if you're interested.",13000.0,Alice,5,
