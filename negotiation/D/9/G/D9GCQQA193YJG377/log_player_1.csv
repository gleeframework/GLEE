"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, as it's worth significantly more to you than that. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $12,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I want to try to get closer to my desired price of $14,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  I'm confident you'll still get great value at that price."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and go with $12,750. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still not high enough.  I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round to try and get closer to my target of $14,000. I believe we're making progress in negotiations, and with a few more rounds, I can likely get a better price than what John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to see eye-to-eye on this. While I appreciate your efforts, $12,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000 as a final compromise. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive from the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is still below my initial target, it's very close. Given the limited rounds left, it's a good idea to accept this offer and secure a sale.  If I reject it and make another counteroffer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away and I'll be left with only John's offer, which is lower.  $12,900 is a good compromise that ensures I don't lose too much money."
