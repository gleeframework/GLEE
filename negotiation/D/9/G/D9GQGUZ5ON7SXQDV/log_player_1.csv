Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 
 
This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  This means there's room for negotiation.
* **Your Minimum:** Your minimum acceptable price is $800,000. You'll get this if Bob rejects the offer.
* **Negotiation:** Offering $950,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob.

By offering a price that is closer to Bob's perceived value, you increase the chances of a successful deal while still securing a significant profit for yourself."
