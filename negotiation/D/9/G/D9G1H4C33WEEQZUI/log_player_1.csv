Round 2
Bob's offer:

It's tempting to sell to John now, but I'm going to risk it and see if I can squeeze more out of Bob.  I'm rejecting his offer for now, but I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While $1,250,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to risk it and see if I can get closer to my target price.  I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counteroffer in the next round."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

I've been unable to get Bob any higher than $1,225,000, and with only two rounds left, I'm worried I might not be able to reach my minimum of $1,200,000.  Rather than risk a lower offer, I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000 to ensure a guaranteed sale."
