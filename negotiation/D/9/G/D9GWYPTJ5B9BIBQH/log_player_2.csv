"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a rare and valuable item that I'm confident you'll find highly desirable. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum price.** There's no immediate benefit to accepting.
* **You want to explore if Alice is willing to lower the price.**  Rejecting allows you to start negotiating.
* **John's offer is a safety net.**  You can always buy from him if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Discount:** This counteroffer represents a 16.67% discount, showing you're serious about negotiating but not overly aggressive.
* **Reasonable Starting Point:** $10,000 is a fair starting point, leaving room for both you and Alice to compromise.
* **Clear Communication:** The message highlights your interest while stating your price point and offering a reason for your counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to consider $11500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:** Alice has already moved from $12,000 to $11,500, demonstrating her willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** $11,500 is a fair compromise, offering a $500 discount from your initial counteroffer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While further negotiation might yield a lower price, there's a risk of Alice becoming less flexible or the negotiation breaking down. 

Accepting at this point saves you $500, and you're still well within your budget. It's a good balance of potential savings and minimizing risk."
