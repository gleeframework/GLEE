Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for less.  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Bob is starting with a strong counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaving room for negotiation. He's aiming to secure the product at a price close to his maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice has now offered the product for Bob's maximum budget. It's not ideal, but it's the best deal available right now.  He should accept and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
