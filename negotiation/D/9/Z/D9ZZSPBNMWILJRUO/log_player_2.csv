"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

The product is worth no more than $8,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is higher. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer was $9,000, which is more than Bob's maximum price of $8,000. Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so he's starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer.  This is a strong starting point for negotiation, and it shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $8,200 is closer to Bob's maximum price of $8,000, it's still higher. Bob is trying to save as much money as possible and there are still rounds left for negotiation. Rejecting the offer gives Bob a chance to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible. His previous counteroffer of $7,500 was rejected.  This time, he's increasing the offer slightly to $7,800,  showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better deal than Alice's last offer of $8,200."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $8,100 is very close to Bob's maximum price of $8,000, there are still rounds left in the negotiation. Bob is determined to save as much money as possible. He is willing to risk a few more rounds to try and get a better deal. Rejecting allows him to make another counteroffer, potentially closing the gap and securing a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7900}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his goal of $8,000. He's increasing his offer slightly to $7,900, aiming to bridge the gap between his previous offer and Alice's last offer of $8,100. This shows Alice that he is serious about reaching a deal while also trying to get a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $8,050 is only $50 above Bob's maximum price of $8,000, there are still rounds left. Bob is determined to get the best possible deal and save as much money as possible. By rejecting, he can make one final counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to his desired $8,000."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
