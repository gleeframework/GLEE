"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I believe my product is truly unique and valuable, and I'm willing to start with a price of $800,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit high for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $650,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's see if we can find common ground.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $725,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, but I believe it reflects the product's value to me.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $725,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $700,000.  This is a good compromise that leaves room for both of us to walk away happy.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm proposing a price of $750,000. This is still a compromise, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value to me.",750000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I understand your position, but $750,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to meet you at $720,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs, and I believe it's a good compromise.  Let's close this deal.",720000.0,Bob,6,
