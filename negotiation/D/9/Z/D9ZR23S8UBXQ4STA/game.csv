"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the price. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is closer to $10000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10000 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $14000?  This still gives you a good deal and is closer to what I need.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $12000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $13000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
