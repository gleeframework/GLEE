"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation.
* A large gap between our starting points encourages a back-and-forth negotiation, giving me more chances to secure a better price.
* I'm leaving myself enough wiggle room to potentially lower my price in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.**  I'm not desperate to sell and can afford to continue negotiating.
* **There are still 8 rounds left.**  This gives me ample opportunity to try and get a better price.
* **Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, but there's still potential to earn more with Bob.**  It's worth continuing negotiations for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer.** This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but am not desperate to sell at his price. 
* **I'm aiming for a middle ground.** This gives Bob a reason to accept, as it's closer to his offer, but also allows me to earn more than his initial offer.
* **I'm still leaving room for further negotiation.** If Bob rejects this offer, I can adjust my counteroffer in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.** While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still not desperate to sell.
* **There are still 6 rounds left.**  This gives me enough time to try and secure a better price.
* **Selling to John is always an option, but I want to exhaust negotiation with Bob first.** There's still potential to get a better price, and I don't want to miss out on that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round.** This signals my willingness to compromise and potentially reach an agreement. 
* **The price is still above Bob's last offer.** This shows that I'm not desperate and maintains some leverage. 
* **I'm keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price.**  This offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still aiming for a better deal if possible. 
* **There are 5 rounds remaining.** This gives me enough time to further negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.**  While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to settle for anything significantly lower than my minimum.
* **There are 4 rounds left.**  This gives me ample time to continue trying to negotiate a better price.
* **Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, but I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.**  I want to exhaust all negotiation options with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **I'm lowering my offer again, showing flexibility and a desire to close the deal.**  However, I'm still above Bob's last offer.
* **I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.** With only 3 rounds left, I need to be realistic about the potential for a much higher price.
* **This price gives Bob a good reason to accept.**  It's significantly closer to his last offer and provides a good compromise.
* **I'm leaving room for a final negotiation.** If Bob rejects this offer, I can consider dropping the price further, but I'll also be evaluating whether selling to John is the better option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Only two rounds remain.** This is a critical point in the negotiation.
* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.**  While it's the closest he's come, I'm not confident I can secure a better deal with him in the remaining rounds.
* **Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price.**  There's a high chance of getting a lower price than my minimum if I continue to negotiate with Bob.
* **I've already shown flexibility and a willingness to compromise.**  At this point, it's wiser to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John than risk getting a lower price from Bob."
