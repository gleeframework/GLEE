"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay $100 for the product, and John is selling it for $100, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice. You'll save time and effort by simply buying from John."
