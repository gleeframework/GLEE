"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000.  I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.

You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum. He can get a better deal by either counter-offering or going to John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $8500 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we settle on $9500?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget, and he can get the product for a cheaper price from John. There's no need to keep negotiating with Alice."
