"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to test the waters and see how interested Bob is in the product. I'm leaving room for negotiation, but still keeping the price above my minimum of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $10,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $15,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, showing Bob I'm serious about selling to him, but it still gives me a comfortable margin above my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is my minimum acceptable price. Bob's offer is $12,000, which is exactly my minimum. There is no reason to continue negotiations and risk a lower price or a deal falling through."
