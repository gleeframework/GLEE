# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150 by you. Considering its high quality and unique features, I'm extending this opportunity to you at an exclusive price of $140. This is a great chance to own a product that truly exceeds your expectations. Please let me know if you're interested in securing it at this special offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $140 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $150 from John. By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of Alice lowering her price further. If she doesn't, you're not losing anything by going with John."
