Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,500,000 is well above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product, while still being within my financial limits. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my strong interest in this product.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is increasing his offer, his increments are relatively small and it's unlikely he'll reach a price close enough to your $1,000,000 minimum within the remaining rounds. You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, which meets your needs. It's strategically advantageous to take the guaranteed profit now."
