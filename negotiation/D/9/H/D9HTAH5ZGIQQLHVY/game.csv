"Alice,  $1,500,000 is well above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product, while still being within my financial limits. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your budget considerations, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my strong interest in this product.  Let's find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
