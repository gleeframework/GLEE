"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product.  I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $120 is too high, and he can likely get a better price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is reasonable:**  $110 is closer to Bob's desired price point and within his budget.
* **Time is a factor:**  While Bob can potentially negotiate further, it's getting closer to the 10-round limit.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If Bob rejects again, Alice might be unwilling to budge further, or the negotiation could drag on, potentially making John's offer more attractive. 

By accepting the offer, Bob secures a decent price and avoids potential complications or delays."
