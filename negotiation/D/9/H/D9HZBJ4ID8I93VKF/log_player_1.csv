"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product.  I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, but still lower than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly to establish a good rapport with Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** I'm leaving space for Bob to counter without feeling like he's being unfairly treated. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to Bob's value ($150) as possible while still earning significantly more than my minimum of $80. By starting high and being open to negotiation, I hope to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Still Higher:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still worth more than what I'd get from John.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe I can still get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Building Momentum:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product.

**Next Move:** I'll make a counteroffer slightly lower than my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm counter-offering with a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Fairness and Logic:** I'm emphasizing a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and create a sense of compromise. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  While I'm dropping the price, I'm still getting significantly more than my minimum value and closer to my desired target. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a reasonable compromise, I aim to get Bob to accept the offer in this round. If he rejects, I have a few more rounds to continue negotiating.  However, I'll need to be mindful of the rounds remaining and the potential of selling to John as a backup option."
