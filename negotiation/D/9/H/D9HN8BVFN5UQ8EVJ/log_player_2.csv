"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is within your budget, there's a chance you could get a better price. You're willing to pay up to $150, so rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for negotiation or the option to buy from John at your maximum price."
