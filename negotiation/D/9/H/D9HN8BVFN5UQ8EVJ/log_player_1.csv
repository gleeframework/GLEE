Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $130. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is key:**  You know the product is worth $150 to Bob, giving you leverage.
* **Aiming high, but leaving room:** Offering it at $130 is significantly more than your minimum ($100) and still a good deal for Bob (saving him $20). 
* **Opening the door for negotiation:** The message is phrased to encourage a response and potential counter-offer from Bob.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still making it likely Bob will accept. If Bob counter-offers, you can always negotiate down slightly, knowing your safety net is selling to John for $100."
