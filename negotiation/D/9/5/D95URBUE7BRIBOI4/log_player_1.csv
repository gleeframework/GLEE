Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum desired value ($15,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've made a profitable sale.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing negotiations or if I should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me.  How about $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $5,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Even though Bob rejected my initial offer, there's still potential for him to come up in price during further negotiations.
* **John is a fallback option:** If negotiations with Bob break down, I can always sell to John for my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a price point that is more agreeable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $5,000 is far too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about $9,000?  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him, making the price seem more reasonable.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for further discussion and potentially finding a mutually acceptable price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great!  I've secured a sale at a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his next counteroffer and decide if I should continue negotiating or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That's a significant saving for me, and still a good price for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **John is a safe option:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my desired price. 
* **Risk of further concessions:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob could lead to further price concessions, potentially getting me further away from my target. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $10,000.  However, if he rejects this offer, I will immediately sell the product to John to avoid further negotiation risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $7,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know if you're interested in this final offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is framed as my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or walk away.
* **Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's desired price but still holding firm on my minimum acceptable price.
* **Clear Value Proposition:** I'm reiterating the value of the product for Bob to make the price seem more palatable.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great!  I've secured a sale at a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I will immediately sell the product to John. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially get a lower price than I'm comfortable with."
