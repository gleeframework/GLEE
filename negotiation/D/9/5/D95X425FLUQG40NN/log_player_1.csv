"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening Offer:**  I'm starting with a price that's halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This gives us room to negotiate while also establishing a starting point that's beneficial to me.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is upbeat and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, making it more likely for him to consider my offer. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  By mentioning the 10 rounds, I subtly highlight the time constraint, potentially encouraging Bob to make a decision sooner rather than later. 

I'm aiming to secure a deal as close to my target price as possible while remaining open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to close a deal, accepting this offer would be a huge loss for me. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still offers you a significant gain, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but demonstrating a willingness to compromise. $1,100,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the potential gain for Bob if he accepts, making the offer more appealing.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  I frame the negotiation as finding a ""middle ground"", suggesting a collaborative approach. This can make Bob feel more involved in the process.

By making a counteroffer, I continue the negotiation while maintaining a firm stance on my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $950,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I will reject this offer and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers,  at $1,025,000.  This would be a win for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by meeting Bob halfway on our last offers.
* **Focus on Win-Win:**  I frame the offer as a win for both of us, emphasizing mutual benefit.
* **Urgency:** I use phrases like ""finally close this deal"" to subtly increase the sense of urgency.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to accept.  I have to consider that I have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000, and I'm not willing to settle for a significantly lower price.  I will reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but it's still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price is fair to both of us, and it would be a great deal for you. Let's finalize this deal before time runs out. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm aiming to reach my minimum acceptable price, which I'm willing to accept.
