Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $15,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and price sensitivity. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or expresses hesitation. You can always adjust your price downwards, but you can't go back up once an offer is made."
