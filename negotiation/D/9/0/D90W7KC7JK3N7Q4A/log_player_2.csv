"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is less than the $12,000 from John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the best deal possible while still being within his budget of $12,000.  He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so he's offering a price slightly above that, hoping to find a middle ground. This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to negotiate while still potentially saving Bob a significant amount compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still within Bob's budget of $12,000 and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob's time being wasted outweighs the potential savings of a few hundred dollars."
