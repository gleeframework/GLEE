{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm also framing it positively, highlighting the value of the product to him.  This will hopefully encourage Bob to counter-offer, allowing us to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I'm not willing to go above that. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I believe I can get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not able to go that low.  $9,000 is simply too far below what I need to get for this product.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? I'm confident this is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but no higher. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has come up a bit from his initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm not confident I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with him.  John offers a guaranteed $10,000, which is a better outcome for me."
