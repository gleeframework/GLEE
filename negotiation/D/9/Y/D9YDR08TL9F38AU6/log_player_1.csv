Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving me room to negotiate if needed.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid losing the deal.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have time for one round of negotiation with Bob before moving on to John."
