I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives him some room to negotiate while ensuring I still make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. I hope this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price from him."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $105 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
