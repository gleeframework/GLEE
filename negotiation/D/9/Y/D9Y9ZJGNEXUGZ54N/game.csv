"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something truly unique and I know you'll find it incredibly valuable. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  While $900,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. Can you meet me at that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming for a bit more. How about we settle at $975,000? It's a compromise that's closer to both of our desired prices, and it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure I can go that high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $975,000. How about $962,500?",962500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway again. Let's split the difference and go with $968,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",968750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit short. How about we meet at $965,000? I'm willing to make a small concession to get the deal done.",965000.0,Bob,8,
