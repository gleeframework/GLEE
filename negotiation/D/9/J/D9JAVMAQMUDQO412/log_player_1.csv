Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $11,000. I'm confident you'll find this a fair price considering the benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:** It's crucial that the offer is significantly higher than John's $8,000, ensuring Alice secures a better deal if Bob accepts.

By setting the price at $11,000, Alice aims to strike a balance between maximizing her profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
