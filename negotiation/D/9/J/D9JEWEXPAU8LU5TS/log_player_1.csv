Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** Framing the offer as ""fair"" helps build goodwill and may encourage Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Open to counteroffers:** The message makes it clear I'm open to negotiation.

**This strategy aims to:**

* **Maximize my potential profit:** I'm starting close to my desired price, but leaving space for compromise.
* **Avoid immediate rejection:** The offer is high enough to be appealing, but not so high as to be immediately rejected. 
* **Set the tone for a successful negotiation:**  This opening offer establishes a clear starting point and shows I'm serious about a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I really think that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.**  While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still a substantial loss compared to my goal.
* **I have a better alternative.** Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a much higher return. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it demonstrates a willingness to negotiate. This gives me leverage to potentially secure a higher price in future rounds.

**By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my position and leave open the possibility of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement or, if necessary, selling to John as a backup plan.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $850,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go any lower than $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Maintaining a higher price:**  I'm still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer, reflecting the product's value to me.
* **Reiterating fairness:** I emphasize ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to see the offer as mutually beneficial.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I leave the door open for further discussion, acknowledging that we may not be at the final price yet. 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Signal my seriousness:** It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a huge loss.
* **Increase the likelihood of agreement:** It's a more reasonable price point than my first offer, potentially making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintain control:** I still have the option to sell to John if Bob rejects this offer, keeping the pressure on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $880000, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is still significantly lower than my desired price.** While it's closer than before, the difference is still substantial, and I'm unlikely to get any closer to my target price.
* **Selling to John guarantees a higher profit.**  $1,000,000 is a much more attractive outcome than settling for $880,000.
* **Negotiation risk:** Further rounds with Bob carry the risk of reaching a stalemate or further lowering the price.  It's not worth risking a significantly lower payout.

**The time to maximize my profit is now. Selling to John ensures a secure, high-value transaction and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiations with Bob.**"
