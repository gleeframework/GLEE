"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the movement. To be honest, $1,075,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about $950,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the market value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the value of this product goes beyond $950,000.  I'm willing to accept $1,025,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
