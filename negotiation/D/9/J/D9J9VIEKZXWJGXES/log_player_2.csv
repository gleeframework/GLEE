"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for us to discuss. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate and see if you can get a price closer to her valuation of $1,000,000.  Buying from John at this stage would be a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This offer is a significant step down from Alice's asking price, aiming to gauge her flexibility.  
* **Anchoring:** By starting low, we establish a lower range for the negotiation, potentially influencing Alice to consider lower prices. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This offer leaves ample room for counteroffers and concessions throughout the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice moved down from her initial offer, indicating she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Still Room for Improvement:**  The new offer is closer to her valuation but still leaves room for us to negotiate a better price.
* **Time is on Our Side:** We have several rounds left, so there's no need to rush into accepting a price that's still significantly above Alice's known valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the movement. To be honest, $1,075,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about $950,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the market value."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** We're increasing our offer, but not by a huge amount, showing Alice we're willing to move but not overly eager.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""market value"" introduces an external factor to justify our counteroffer and potentially encourage Alice to be more realistic.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps us gauge how much further Alice is willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the value of this product goes beyond $950,000.  I'm willing to accept $1,025,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:**  Alice is likely using a common negotiation tactic to create a sense of urgency. However, it's also a strong signal that she's getting close to her absolute bottom line.
* **Significant Price Reduction:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer of $1,150,000.
* **Acceptable Price:** While not ideal, $1,025,000 is within a reasonable range of both her valuation and our budget. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has the potential for a slightly better price, but also risks losing the deal entirely if Alice is serious about her ""final offer"" or the other interested buyer."
