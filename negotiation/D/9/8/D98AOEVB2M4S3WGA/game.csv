"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a price that reflects the product's true worth. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1,050,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $850,000.  I believe this price is fair considering both our needs.  If you're willing to accept, we can finalize the deal.  If not, I might need to look at other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm now offering it to you for $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,5,,
