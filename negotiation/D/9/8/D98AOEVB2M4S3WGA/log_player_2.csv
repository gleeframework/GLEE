"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a price that reflects the product's true worth. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $1,000,000 is still above Bob's maximum value of $1,200,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy at this point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1,050,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's maximum value of $1,200,000. While it's a better price than the previous round, it's still not within Bob's budget. Rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows Bob to continue negotiating towards a more favorable price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $850,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm now offering it to you for $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $900,000 is less than Bob's maximum value of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** Alice has stated this is her final offer. 
* **Risk of losing the product:** If Bob rejects the offer, he risks Alice sticking to her final price or potentially even raising it again.  
* **Opportunity cost:**  Buying from John would cost Bob $1,200,000, so this offer is a significant savings.

While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price. Accepting the offer is the most prudent decision."
