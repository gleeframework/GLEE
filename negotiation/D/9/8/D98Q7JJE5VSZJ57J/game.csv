"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $9,200 for the product. Would you be willing to go up to that price?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,200 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to pay $8,750.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. Would you be willing to go up to $9,250?",9250.0,Alice,5,
