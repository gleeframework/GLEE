Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product for $1,400,000. I believe it holds significant value, even more so for you given your needs. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice's goal is to maximize her earnings. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, Alice can aim for a price significantly higher than her minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **John as Backup:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't fall below $1,200,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * Bob saves $100,000 compared to his perceived value.
    * Alice earns $200,000 more than selling to John. 
* **""Take it or Leave it"" Approach:** This creates a sense of urgency and discourages negotiation, pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has accurately assessed Bob's valuation and risk tolerance. There's always a chance Bob might reject the offer, leading Alice to sell to John."
