"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,100,000?  This price would allow me to meet my minimum requirements and still offer you a significant discount from the product's true value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,050,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can come to an agreement at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
