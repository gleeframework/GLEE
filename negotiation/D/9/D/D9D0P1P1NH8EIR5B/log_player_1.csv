Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $13,500.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 13500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value Isn't Realistic:** In a real negotiation, you wouldn't know Bob values the product at $10,000. This response assumes you *don't* have that information. 
* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value, you provide a reason for the price without explicitly revealing your minimum. 
* **Time Pressure:** The phrase ""before I list it publicly"" creates a subtle sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

**Important:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your negotiation style and your assessment of Bob, you might choose a different approach."
