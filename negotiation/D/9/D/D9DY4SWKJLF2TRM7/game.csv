"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  I'm confident you'll still find this a great deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $100. How about we try $95? I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're very determined to get this product! I'm willing to come down a little further, but $95 is still too low for me. How about we settle on $105? It's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. How about we try $92? I'm willing to pay $92 for the product.",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to find a deal. I'm willing to go down to $98 for this product. That's my final offer. If you're not willing to go up to that price, I'll have to consider selling to someone else.",98.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to go down to $98, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we try $90? I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.",90.0,Bob,8,
