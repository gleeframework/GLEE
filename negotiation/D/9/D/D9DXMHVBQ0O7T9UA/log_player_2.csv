Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

You're still better off buying from John for $150 than accepting Alice's offer of $130. You can try to negotiate further with Alice, hoping to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Alice's offer is $125, which is still higher than the price you can get from John ($150).  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of a longer negotiation process isn't worth it.  It's better to secure the product at a known price from John."
