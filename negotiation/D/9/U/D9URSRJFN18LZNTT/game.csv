"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for this product.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
