"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $1,050,000? This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit and hopefully remain within your budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
