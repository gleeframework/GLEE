"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation but signals that I'm confident in the product's worth."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, it's still within a reasonable range. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I'm willing to continue negotiating with him, hoping to reach a price that is more favorable to me. I'm also mindful of the fact that selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, but I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob."

```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still slightly below my minimum. I'm hoping to squeeze out a bit more by making a counteroffer in the next round. It's getting late in the negotiation, but I'm confident I can still secure a better deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1520000}
```

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,490,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,490,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 3 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is increasing. I've tried to negotiate, but Bob seems unwilling to meet my minimum price.  Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  Therefore, it's the safest and most sensible option at this point."
