"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds immense value, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,600,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the value of the product. However, your offer is significantly below its true worth and my minimum acceptable price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a substantial concession, and I believe it reflects my genuine interest in closing a deal with you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this deal. I'm eager to finalize this transaction, so let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $1,000,000 is a substantial offer, but it's still a gap from where I need to be. I'm willing to make another move to show I'm committed to finding a solution. My counteroffer is $1,250,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,100,000. This is a significant step closer to your offer, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. I'm eager to finalize this deal, so let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're very close to a deal that works for both of us. I appreciate you coming up to $1,100,000. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm offering the product at $1,175,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate fairly.",1175000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1,175,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a significant commitment on my part, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's close this deal. This is my final offer.",1150000.0,Bob,8,
