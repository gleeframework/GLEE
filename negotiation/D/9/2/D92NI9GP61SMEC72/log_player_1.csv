"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you, and you'll be making a significant profit. Let's close this quickly!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize that the product is worth more to Bob than the price I'm asking, suggesting he will be getting a good deal.
* **Urgency:** I create a sense of urgency by urging Bob to act quickly, making him feel like he needs to accept or risk losing out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a significant investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a lot closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I'm aiming for. I'm not in a rush to sell and I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to still make a substantial profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not too far.
* **Fairness:** I highlight that $1,050,000 is a fair price for both of us, emphasizing mutual benefit.
* **Profit Motivation:** I remind Bob that he can still make a significant profit with this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,025,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm holding out for a better offer. I have John lined up for a much higher price and still have 6 rounds left to see if I can get closer to my target with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your persistence, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1,037,500? This is a fair compromise, and it allows you to still make a significant profit.  I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1037500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Continued Compromise:** I'm showing further flexibility by moving even closer to Bob's offer.
* **Fairness Again:** I emphasize the compromise and the potential profit for Bob. 
* **Urgency (Subtle):** I subtly suggest a sense of urgency by mentioning reaching a deal that works for both of us. This keeps the pressure on Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to get as close to my target price as possible. I'm willing to go up to $1,020,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,020,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  We are only halfway through the negotiation rounds, and the negotiation is getting increasingly difficult. Given that I have a guaranteed buyer, John, willing to pay my minimum price, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John now.  I don't want to risk getting stuck in a protracted negotiation with Bob and potentially miss out on a much higher price."
