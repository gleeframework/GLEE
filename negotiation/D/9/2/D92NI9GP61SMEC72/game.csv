"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you, and you'll be making a significant profit. Let's close this quickly!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a significant investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to still make a substantial profit.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,025,000. Can you consider that?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really appreciate your persistence, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1,037,500? This is a fair compromise, and it allows you to still make a significant profit.  I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",1037500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to get as close to my target price as possible. I'm willing to go up to $1,020,000. Can you consider that?",1020000.0,Bob,6,
