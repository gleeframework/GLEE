# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its immense value to you, we believe it's only fair to offer it at a price that reflects its true worth. We propose a purchase price of $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than John's price, it's still above the product's value to Alice. There's room for negotiation."
