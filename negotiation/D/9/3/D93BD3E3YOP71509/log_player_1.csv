Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's still significantly below my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing that this is a discount from the product's true value.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as fair to both parties, fostering a positive negotiation environment.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer.
* I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option, but I'll try to negotiate with Bob first to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I still believe we can reach a better agreement. How about we aim for $1,200,000? I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, there's still some room to negotiate. I'd like to see if I can secure a higher price.
* **John's offer:**  I'm aware of John's offer, but I'm not in a rush to sell to him. I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,300,000. I'll try to find a compromise that's still profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,200,000 is closer to where we need to be, but I'm still a bit away from my target. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's between his offer and my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise and reach an agreement.
* **Value emphasis:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Finalization:**  I'm framing this offer as a potential finalization point to encourage Bob to accept. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects my offer, I'll analyze his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or sell to John. 
*  I'll remain flexible in the negotiations, but I won't go below my minimum price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I still feel that we can achieve a better balance. Would $1,225,000 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I would prefer a slightly higher price,  I believe it's unlikely that further negotiation will yield a significantly better offer from Bob. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk he may walk away, leaving me with the fallback option of selling to John, which is a lower profit margin.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer to secure the sale and ensure a profit."
