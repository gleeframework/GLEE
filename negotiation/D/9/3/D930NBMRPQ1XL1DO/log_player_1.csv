"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than the product's value to Bob, but not excessively so. This allows room for negotiation while still giving me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $110 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm counteroffering at $115. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be agreeable to him. It allows me to make a profit while still being competitive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $112 is a good deal and it's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for less."
