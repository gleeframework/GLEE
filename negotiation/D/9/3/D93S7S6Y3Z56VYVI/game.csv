"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Could you consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500. This still leaves a good margin for you, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $9,750 for the product. This is a good compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",9750.0,Alice,5,
