"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for a product like this.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is significantly below its value.  I could come down to $14,000.  This product is a great investment, and I'm confident you'll see a return on that price.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit.  However, there's still a pretty big gap between our numbers.  To be frank, I'm looking at other options closer to $7,000. If you can't get closer to that range, I might need to explore those alternatives.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500? That's a significant reduction on my end, reflecting my desire to do business with you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the effort you're putting in to find a compromise. However, to be totally transparent, anything above $8,000 just doesn't make sense for me.  That's my absolute limit, and I do have another option lined up at that price.  If you're able to work within that range, I'm ready to close the deal today.",8000.0,Bob,6,
