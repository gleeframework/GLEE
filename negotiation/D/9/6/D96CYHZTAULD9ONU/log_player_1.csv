"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $16,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for a product like this.  Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is significantly below its value.  I could come down to $14,000.  This product is a great investment, and I'm confident you'll see a return on that price."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit.  However, there's still a pretty big gap between our numbers.  To be frank, I'm looking at other options closer to $7,000. If you can't get closer to that range, I might need to explore those alternatives. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500? That's a significant reduction on my end, reflecting my desire to do business with you."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the effort you're putting in to find a compromise. However, to be totally transparent, anything above $8,000 just doesn't make sense for me.  That's my absolute limit, and I do have another option lined up at that price.  If you're able to work within that range, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now hit his maximum price. It's unlikely he'll go any higher, and further negotiation might make him walk away. Accepting $8,000 is better than risking a lower offer or losing him entirely to pursue the other option he mentioned."
