"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000 to see if we can find common ground.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but that price point is a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more realistic.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if we can find a compromise, but I'm not willing to sell at that price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is quite a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is still a significant discount from my initial price, and I believe it reflects the value you'll gain from this product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a good middle ground here.  How about we split the difference closer to your last offer? I'm willing to go up to $725,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $725,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still too low.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed offer from John, and I'm not going to settle for less than what I need."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart, but I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe this product will be a valuable asset for your business. Let's see if we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
