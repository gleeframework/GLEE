"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000 to see if we can find common ground.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but that price point is a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more realistic.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is quite a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is still a significant discount from my initial price, and I believe it reflects the value you'll gain from this product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to find a good middle ground here.  How about we split the difference closer to your last offer? I'm willing to go up to $725,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 725000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart, but I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe this product will be a valuable asset for your business. Let's see if we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down, it's unlikely she'll reach a price that beats John's offer of $800,000. Continuing the negotiation with Alice has a lower potential payoff than simply buying from John at this point."
