"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000 to see if we can find common ground.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but that price point is a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more realistic.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is quite a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is still a significant discount from my initial price, and I believe it reflects the value you'll gain from this product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a good middle ground here.  How about we split the difference closer to your last offer? I'm willing to go up to $725,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart, but I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe this product will be a valuable asset for your business. Let's see if we can agree on this price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
