"Thank you for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $135. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $135 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  If you're serious about selling, this is my best offer.",115.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to meet my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $125. It's the lowest I can go and still make a profit.",125.0,Alice,5,
