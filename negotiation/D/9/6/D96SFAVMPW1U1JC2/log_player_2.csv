"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident it will be highly beneficial for your business.  Let me know your thoughts.  If you decline, I'll be moving forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is above her own valuation, it's still significantly less than your maximum budget and the price John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
