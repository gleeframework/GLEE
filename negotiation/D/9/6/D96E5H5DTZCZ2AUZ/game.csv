"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I can't go below $9,500. This is still a great price for you, as the product is worth $12,000 to me. Let's make this deal happen.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $9,200 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a little more and offer the product for $9,350. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let's close this deal.",9350.0,Alice,5,
