Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. We understand your goal to reach $1,000,000, but we're still not willing to go that low. However, we're willing to meet you closer to your target. We're offering the product for $1,125,000. This is our final compromise, and we hope it's acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. While I'd prefer a price closer to $1,000,000, $1,125,000 is a good deal considering:

* **Time is running out:**  We're already at Round 5, and I don't want to risk Alice walking away or her changing her mind.
* **John's price:**  If I don't accept, I'm looking at paying $1,500,000 to John, which is significantly higher than Alice's current offer.

It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price than risk losing out to John or having Alice retract her offer."
