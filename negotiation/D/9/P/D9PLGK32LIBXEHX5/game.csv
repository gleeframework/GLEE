"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't proceed with a purchase at $15,000. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12,000. This aligns better with what I am willing to spend.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. I've carefully considered your offer, and while I understand your position, I believe I can't move forward with a purchase at $13,500. To better align with my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12,000. This is the maximum I am willing to pay for the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
