"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $850000 is a bit lower than I can go at this time.  Let's meet in the middle at $925000. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $925000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $900000? I think this is a fair compromise that would be beneficial for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
