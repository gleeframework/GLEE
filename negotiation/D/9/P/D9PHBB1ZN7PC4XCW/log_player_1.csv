Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is more than your minimum of $12,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still $1,000 of potential gain for you if Bob is willing to pay closer to his perceived value.
* **It's fair to Bob:** $14,000 is still less than the product is worth to him, so he has an incentive to accept. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm looking to save as much as I can, and I'm not sure I can go above $12000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is at your minimum, it's worth trying to get a bit more.  Since you have a backup buyer (John), you're in a good position to push for a better deal.  Rejecting this offer allows you to counter and see if Bob is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I'm willing to be flexible, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This counteroffer is strategic because:

* **It's a compromise:** It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than your initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **It still leaves room for profit:** You're still earning more than your minimum while potentially getting closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **It keeps the negotiation open:**  By not rejecting Bob entirely, you leave the door open for him to potentially accept or counter with something closer to your offer.

Let's see if Bob will bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $13000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While it's tempting to try and squeeze out a few more dollars from Bob, his latest offer is significantly lower than your minimum, and you've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees you a decent profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
