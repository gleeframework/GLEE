"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I know it's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $175.  What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $175 is a bit steep for me though.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $60 is too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, how about we meet in the middle at $115?  I'm still open to hearing your thoughts.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $115 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $75 is unfortunately still below my minimum price point. To show I'm willing to compromise, I'll come down to $100. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and it's the lowest I can go. Let me know your thoughts.",100.0,Alice,5,
