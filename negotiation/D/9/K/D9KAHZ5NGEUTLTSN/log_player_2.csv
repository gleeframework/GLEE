You have three options:

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $75 is unfortunately still below my minimum price point. To show I'm willing to compromise, I'll come down to $100. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and it's the lowest I can go. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $100. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John at $80."
