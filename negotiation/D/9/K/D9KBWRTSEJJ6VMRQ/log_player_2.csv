Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000 to reflect your budget, but I can't go any lower.  This is still a good deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for significantly less than its true value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
