{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that's attractive to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also highlights the value Bob will receive from the product.  By starting high, I can potentially gain a larger share of the surplus, but I'm also prepared to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding of the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000 to reflect your budget, but I can't go any lower.  This is still a good deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for significantly less than its true value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, but it's still below it. I'm confident that John will pay my minimum price, and I'm not interested in negotiating further with Bob."
