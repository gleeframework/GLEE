Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product!  I'm confident it's a great fit for your needs. My asking price is $1,300,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob ($1,300,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts.

**Strategy:**  I'm aiming to get as close to the product's true value for Bob as possible while still ensuring a profit for myself. This is a good starting point to begin a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to take $1,100,000,  I'm confident in the value of the product and believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer, aiming to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a specific budget in mind. While $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This price allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and his budget constraints, showing that I'm listening.
* **Counteroffer:** I propose a price of $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price but also a compromise from my initial offer. 
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize that this price allows both of us to get a good deal, making it more appealing to Bob.

**Strategy:** I'm aiming to reach a mutually acceptable price that is as close as possible to my desired value. By being flexible and highlighting the benefits of my counteroffer, I hope to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, his final offer of $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's likely that further negotiations will not result in a price that meets my needs. 

Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price, it's the most sensible choice to sell the product to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
