"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high allows for room to negotiate down. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I highlight the product's potential value to Bob,  without revealing my minimum price. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I encourage Bob to respond, indicating I'm open to negotiation.

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest and establish a starting point for negotiations. If Bob rejects the offer, I can adjust my counteroffers based on his response in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $1000000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $600000 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.**  $600,000 is far below my minimum of $800,000, making it a non-viable option.
* **Selling to John is a safer option at this point.**  John's offer guarantees me $800,000, which is my minimum. 
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's interest is encouraging, his low offer indicates a need for more bargaining.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price, potentially leading to a better outcome. 

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer, aiming to bridge the gap between our valuations. If this fails, I will proceed with selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to negotiate. I'm prepared to lower my price to $850,000.  This reflects the value I believe the product holds for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable drop:** I'm lowering my price by $150,000, showing flexibility while still maintaining a profitable margin.
* **Emphasize potential value:** I reiterate the product's value for Bob, hoping to encourage him to bridge the gap further.
* **Open to compromise:** I state my willingness to find common ground, implying a willingness to continue negotiating.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground with Bob, while still keeping my minimum price in mind. I'm prepared to adjust my counteroffer further in the following rounds, based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $850000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go to $750000.  This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.** While he's moved closer to my price, $750,000 is still below my $800,000 minimum.
* **John's offer provides a secure baseline.** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum and eliminates the risk of further negotiation.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe there's still potential for a higher price, particularly since he's labeled his offer as ""final."" I can use this to my advantage in the next round.

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer, aiming to push him even closer to my target price. If this fails, I'll proceed with selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your business, $750,000 is still not quite meeting my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $825,000. This reflects the value I see in our potential partnership and is my final offer. Let me know if you're able to accept."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'm lowering my price by $25,000, signaling a willingness to compromise while maintaining a price above my minimum. 
* **Emphasize Partnership:** I frame this as a final offer, highlighting the potential for a long-term relationship, hoping to motivate Bob to accept.
* **Finality:** By stating this is my final offer, I create pressure for Bob to make a decision. If he rejects, I have a strong justification to move to John.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while minimizing further negotiation and maximizing my potential earnings. If Bob rejects this, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm really trying to get this deal done, but $825000 is still a bit more than I can afford.  How about we split the difference and settle on $800000?  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for me, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum.**  $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and Bob's offer matches this.
* **Negotiation Exhausted:** We've been negotiating for several rounds, and it's unlikely Bob will increase his offer significantly. 
* **Secure the deal:**  Accepting this offer secures the sale and ensures I receive my desired minimum price. 

While selling to John would also guarantee $800,000, accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal and potentially build a relationship for future business opportunities."
