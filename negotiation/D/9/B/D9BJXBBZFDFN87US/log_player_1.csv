Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000 for this product.  It's a great product, but I need to stay within my budget.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 

Bob is clearly very interested and is moving closer to my acceptable range. While I could push for a little more, accepting his split-the-difference offer of $875,000 is a good deal and avoids the risk of him walking away."
