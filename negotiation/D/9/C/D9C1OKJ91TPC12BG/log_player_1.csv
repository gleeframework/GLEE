Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $22,000. It's a fantastic deal for something of this quality and value. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 22000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Anchoring:** Offering a high initial price can ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value.  Even if he doesn't accept the $22,000, it might make a lower counter-offer from him more appealing.
* **Knowing Your Alternatives:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000. This gives you leverage. Aiming higher with Bob initially makes sense.

**Important:** It's crucial to remember this is just an opening offer. Be prepared to:

* **Negotiate:** If Bob rejects the initial offer, be ready to lower the price strategically. 
* **Walk Away:** If Bob won't budge and you can't reach a price that works for you, you have John as a reliable backup."
