"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value, but I believe I can't afford $14,000 at the moment. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my valuation and what John is offering.  I need to negotiate higher.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my original ask. How about $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've given this some more thought and I'd like to propose $10,000 as a fair price for the product. This is still lower than your initial offer, but I believe it's a reasonable compromise considering its value. I hope we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a tricky spot. Bob is now offering what John is guaranteed to pay. There's a chance to get more from Bob, but also a risk he walks away. 

```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While I could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer of $10,000 is the safest option at this point. It guarantees I get the same amount John is offering without the risk of further negotiation."
