Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll meet you at $125. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle!

It's time to cut your losses.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $125, and you have a guaranteed option at $100 with John.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a low chance of success and risks missing out on your target price."
