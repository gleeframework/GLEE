"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This still represents a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",10800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $10,800 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,150?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know your thoughts.",11150.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,150 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",11000.0,Bob,6,
