Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, the price is still significantly higher than John's offer of $80. It's unlikely Alice will come down to a price that's significantly more appealing than $80 within a reasonable number of rounds.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at the best available price."
