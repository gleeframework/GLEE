"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While Alice's offer is still above the product's worth to her ($800,000), it's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000. 
* **You still save money.**  You'll save $300,000 by accepting Alice's offer. 

Even though you could potentially negotiate further with Alice, accepting her initial offer is the most logical decision to maximize your savings."
