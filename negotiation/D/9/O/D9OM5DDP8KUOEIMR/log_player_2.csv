"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $15,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my value for the product. While $12,000 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about negotiating. It's also a fair starting point, considering the product is worth $10,000 to Alice.  This leaves room for some back-and-forth to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10,500 is a good price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to the $15,000 value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, but there's still room for improvement.  Rejecting her offer allows you to make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to your initial $10,500.  You can propose something like $11,000, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate while still seeking a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down in price. I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial offer though.  How about $11,000?  That would be a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small step closer to Alice's last offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.  It also stays within your initial desired price range, giving you some wiggle room if Alice wants to negotiate further.  The message remains friendly and focused on finding a compromise."
