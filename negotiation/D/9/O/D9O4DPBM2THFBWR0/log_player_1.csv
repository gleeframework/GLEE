"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a slightly higher price than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a stronger starting position. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price. I'm confident I can get at least a small increase through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I understand it's a valuable product to you, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? It's still a great deal for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to stick to my original offer of $8,000 as that's within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is firm on his offer of $8,000.  Since this is my minimum acceptable price and I've already rejected his offer twice, it's best to accept and close the deal.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose this buyer.  Selling to John would net me the same amount, so accepting Bob's offer is the best decision at this point."
