"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering your offer of $6,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $8,500. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
