"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to both of us, so let's see if we can find a price that works for both sides. My initial offer is $1700000. This reflects the value I'm placing on the product and the potential benefits you'll receive.",1700000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1700000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product, recognizing its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a certain budget, but $1400000 is simply too low for me. It doesn't reflect the true value of the product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1600000? This gives you a good deal while still ensuring I get a fair price.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, but $1600000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1450000, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge this gap.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here, but $1450000 is still too low for me. We're getting closer, though.  I'm willing to go down to $1550000.  This is a fair compromise, and it reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1550000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to pay $1500000, which is my maximum budget. This is a fair price considering the value for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
