"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. My starting offer is $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $750,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $750,000 is your current limit. However, it's important for me to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile.  I'm proposing $850,000.  Let's work together to find a price that's fair for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to stay above $800,000. I'm willing to go a little higher, but $850,000 is still too much for me.  I'm prepared to offer $825,000.  This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
