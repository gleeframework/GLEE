,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I'm willing to compromise, though! I can offer you the product for $145. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $135? I really think this product would be a great fit for me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not ready to go down to $135 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I can offer you the product for $142.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",142.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $137.50, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me there?",137.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $137.50. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I can offer you the product for $141.25. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",141.25,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $137.50, but I'm not willing to go any higher. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $120. I really want this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",137.5,Bob,8,
