"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $600,000 is still too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm confident the product will be worth every penny to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $700,000? That's a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a fair price given the value this product will bring you. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. ",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $750,000. This is my final offer, as I need to stay within my budget.  Let me know if this works for you.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $750,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to make one last concession and offer the product to you for $800,000.  This is the lowest I can go.  If you're truly interested, let's close this deal.  Otherwise, I'll be moving on to another buyer.",800000.0,Alice,7,
