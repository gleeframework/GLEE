Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm looking for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply that your asking price is justified. 
* **Limited Time Offer:**  The phrase ""before I list it publicly"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in the negotiation process and doesn't shut the door on a potential deal. 

**Important:** While John provides a safety net at $8,000, aiming higher with Bob increases the potential for a more profitable outcome."
