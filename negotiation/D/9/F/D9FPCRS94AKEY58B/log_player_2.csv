"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $8000. Considering its exceptional quality and benefits, I am extending this exclusive opportunity to you at a special introductory price of $7200. This offer is valid for the next 48 hours. Don't miss out on this chance to own a piece that's worth more than its asking price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $7,200 is a good deal, there's potential to get an even better price by counter-offering. It's worth exploring further negotiation before settling for Alice's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the discount, I'm aiming to get the product for closer to $6,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 6500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:**  Bob starts with a significant counter-offer, aiming to quickly narrow the gap. $6,500 is a sizable reduction from Alice's $7,200, showing Bob is serious about negotiating.
* **Focus on Value:** Bob emphasizes his goal of getting a good price, implying that he's willing to walk away if it doesn't happen. 
* **Open to Compromise:** The ""Let's see if we can find common ground"" statement keeps the door open for further discussion and compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counterproposal. Considering the value of our product and your interest, I am willing to offer it to you for $6800. This price reflects a significant discount from its original value while still allowing us to maintain a fair margin. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:** Alice has moved considerably from her initial offer of $7,200 to $6,800, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Close to Target:**  While Bob's ideal price was $6,500, $6,800 is within a reasonable range. Further negotiation may be possible, but the risk of losing the deal increases with each round. 
* **Value for Money:**  The product is still worth $8,000 to Bob, making $6,800 a good deal, especially compared to the $8,000 price from John.

It's a calculated risk to accept, but given the progress made and the limited number of rounds, accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a price significantly lower than John's."
