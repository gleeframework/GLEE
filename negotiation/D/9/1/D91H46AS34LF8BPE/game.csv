"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I need to let you know that I'm looking for a price that reflects its true value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That said, I'm looking to spend a bit less on this purchase. How about we bring the price down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I think it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
