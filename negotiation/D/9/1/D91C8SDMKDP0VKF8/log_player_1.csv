Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:** The price is significantly higher than John's $1,000,000 offer, ensuring that selling to Bob remains the most profitable option if he accepts."
