"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $1500000. It's a steal considering its true value, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is looking to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is at the maximum price Bob is willing to pay. There's potential to get a better deal by negotiating."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm interested in the product but would need to see a price closer to $1,200,000 to make it work. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a bit.  $1200000 is a little low for me, but I'm prepared to sell for $1350000. This is a fair price that allows me to cover my costs while still offering you a good deal. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but it's still above Bob's target. There's still room for negotiation. Bob can aim for a lower price in the next round, potentially getting closer to his desired $1,200,000. Buying from John at this point would be a waste of money compared to continuing negotiations with Alice."
