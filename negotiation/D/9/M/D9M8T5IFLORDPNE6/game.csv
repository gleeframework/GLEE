"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $1500000. It's a steal considering its true value, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm interested in the product but would need to see a price closer to $1200000 to make it work. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a bit.  $1200000 is a little low for me, but I'm prepared to sell for $1350000. This is a fair price that allows me to cover my costs while still offering you a good deal. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'd hoped.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1275000?  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
