"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within $15,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $10,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a significant discount for you. This price reflects the value of the product and allows me to reach a fair deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $9,500. This is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can push for a better price. There are still several rounds left, and I'm confident I can reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $10,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. It's a good price for you and allows me to secure a deal that's beneficial for me. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, Alice. Based on the value of the product and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $10,000. This offers a reasonable compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to push for a higher price, I've reached a point where it's more advantageous to accept Bob's offer of $10,000. This price is significantly better than selling to John, and it seems unlikely that further negotiation will lead to a higher offer from Bob.  It's time to secure the deal and move on."
