"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product looks promising, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it would allow us to both walk away happy. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're close to a deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
