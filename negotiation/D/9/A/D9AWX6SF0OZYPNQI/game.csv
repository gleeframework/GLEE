"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm aiming to spend no more than $10,500 for this product. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob! However, I was thinking of a price that's a bit higher than that. How about $11,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to still make a profit while helping me stay within my spending limit. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm thinking of a price that's a bit higher than that. How about $11,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",11800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm committed to getting this deal done, but $11,800 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,400? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to still make a good profit while helping me stay within my budget.  Let's make this happen!",11400.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm not willing to meet you at $11,400. I'm thinking of a price that's a bit higher than that. How about $12,200? I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product.",12200.0,Alice,7,
