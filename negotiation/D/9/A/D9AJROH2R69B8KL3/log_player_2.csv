Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $7,125. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $7,300. It's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower.  While you could try for a slightly better price, the difference is getting small and you risk her accepting a better offer from someone else. $7,300 is a reasonable price and a good deal compared to John's offer."
