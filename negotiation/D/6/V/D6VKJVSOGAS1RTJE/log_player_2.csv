"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $16,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $16,000 is higher than both your maximum budget ($12,000) and what John offers ($12,000). It makes the most sense to buy from John to save money."
