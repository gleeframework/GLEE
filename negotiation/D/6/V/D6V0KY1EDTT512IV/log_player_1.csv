Round 2
Bob's offer:

Bob is consistently moving away from the initial offer and is now getting too close to the backup offer. It's important to hold firm to get a price closer to the product's value."

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer from this point. Accepting his offer at $975,000 would be a loss compared to John's standing offer of $800,000.  It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale to John."
