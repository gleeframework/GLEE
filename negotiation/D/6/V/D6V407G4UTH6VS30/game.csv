"I'm interested in the product, but I'm not willing to pay $1500000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $800000 is simply too low for me. I'm confident this product holds significant value, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price that reflects that. To show my commitment to working with you, I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $900000 is still significantly lower than what this product is truly worth. To demonstrate my willingness to meet you halfway, I'm willing to drop my price to $1100000. This is a substantial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal and make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
