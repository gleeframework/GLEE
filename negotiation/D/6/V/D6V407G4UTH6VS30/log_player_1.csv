"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire [Product description - be vague but intriguing].  This product is valued at over $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. My initial offer is $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I'm not willing to pay $1500000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $800,000 is a significant amount of money, it's far below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to give away this valuable product for a substantial loss.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer that hopefully bridges the gap and keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm confident this product holds significant value, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price that reflects that. To show my commitment to working with you, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum threshold, it's still not enough.  I'm motivated to close a deal with Bob, but I can't afford to sell the product for less than $1,000,000.  I'm hoping that by rejecting Bob's offer, I can push him further towards my price point in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $900,000 is still significantly lower than what this product is truly worth. To demonstrate my willingness to meet you halfway, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000. This is a substantial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer, but his offer is still below my minimum threshold. I've made significant concessions, and I'm running out of time. With only 4 rounds left, I'm concerned that Bob might continue to stall or offer a price that's still too low.  To ensure I secure at least my minimum value, I'm going to accept John's offer of $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, it's important to be realistic and secure a sale that meets my requirements."
