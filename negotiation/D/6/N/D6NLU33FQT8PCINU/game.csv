"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree this product would be valuable for me, I'm not quite ready to meet that price point. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you'll get from the product and the market demand.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my price range, but the gap is still too wide.  I can go up to $725,000.  This offer reflects a serious interest on my end while still acknowledging the value this product brings.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $725,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering the value you'll get from the product, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $775,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you'll get from the product and the market demand. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting much closer. Let's settle this now. I'm willing to pay $750,000. This is a strong offer, and I think it's fair for both of us considering the value of the product and the remaining time for negotiation.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750,000. Considering the value you'll get from the product, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $775,000. This is the best price I'm willing to offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",775000.0,Alice,7,
