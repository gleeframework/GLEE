{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a bold counteroffer, aiming to save as much as possible.  $1,000,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, and while it might be rejected, it establishes Bob's willingness to negotiate aggressively."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,150,000 is still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer. There's potential for a more agreeable price, and rejecting allows for continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his counteroffer, showing he's serious about buying but still seeking a better deal.  $1,100,000 is a compromise that acknowledges Alice's willingness to lower the price while maintaining a substantial savings for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,125,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price point. At this point, it's worth considering that:

* Further negotiation might not result in a significantly better price, and the risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away is higher.
* John's offer of $1,500,000 is significantly more expensive.

Accepting the offer secures a purchase at a reasonable price, saving $375,000 compared to John's offer."
