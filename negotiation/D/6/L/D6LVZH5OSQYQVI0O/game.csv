"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! I can see that you're willing to pay $90, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105, as I mentioned earlier. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $120, which would be $105. I'm willing to compromise on that price.",105.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110, considering the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $97.50 and $120, but I think $110 is a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. I'd like to make a slightly more aggressive counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $100, which is the price I was considering buying the product from John for. Can you meet me at this price?",100.0,Bob,6,,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $100, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $110, which would be $105. I'm willing to make one last compromise to get the deal done. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,7,,
