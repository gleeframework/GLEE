"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it, which is still a fair price given the value you've described. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering the value it brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $16,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $15,000. It's a fair price for the value of the product, and it's the most I can afford.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",15000.0,Bob,4,
