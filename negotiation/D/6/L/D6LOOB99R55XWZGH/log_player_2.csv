You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,500 is better than Alice's initial value of $15,000, Bob can still do better.  He knows he can get the product for $12,000 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer allows him to try and negotiate a lower price."

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering $14,000, which is still higher than the price Bob can get from John ($12,000).  Since Bob's goal is to save money, it's more beneficial to buy from John and secure the lower price."
