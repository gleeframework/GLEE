"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and opens the door for a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is a good profit, we still have room to negotiate and aim for a higher price closer to Bob's perceived value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $1,100,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe the true value of this product sits higher.  Would you consider $1,225,000? This allows us both to benefit significantly from this deal."",
""product_price"": 1225000
}
``` 

We're aiming for a point between our initial offer and Bob's counter. This keeps the negotiation moving while still pushing for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,150,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is moving closer to our desired range, but we're not at a point where accepting his offer is the best option yet. We'll continue to negotiate strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  It seems we're getting closer. How about we split the difference between our last two proposals and settle on $1,187,500? I believe this represents a fair and mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1187500
}
``` 

We're continuing to meet Bob halfway, demonstrating our willingness to negotiate while steadily guiding the price closer to our target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $1,175,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

This is a good point to accept. Bob has signaled this is his final offer, and while we could potentially push for slightly more, we are already well above our minimum and risking a stalled negotiation. Accepting ensures a very profitable deal."
