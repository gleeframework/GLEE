(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $10,000, and Alice's offer is significantly higher, it's a bad deal for you. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price or move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Alice a price significantly lower than her initial offer but still a price that's higher than my absolute maximum from John. This allows for potential negotiation space while still keeping my budget in mind."

Alice's offer is now at my maximum budget, and John is also selling it for the same price. I don't see any reason to continue negotiating, so I will accept the offer and buy the product."
