Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a starting point. I'm setting the price at $15,000, which is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation, but not so high that it immediately scares Bob away. 

I'll be watching Bob's response closely to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  $7,000 is significantly less than my minimum of $12,000. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer. I need to find a price that is fair for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $10,000.  This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I hope this will encourage Bob to come closer to a price I'm comfortable with."
