"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is looking to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $8,250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to his budget, it's still slightly higher than what he wants to pay.  He can likely get a better price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $8,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $8,100. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice is closer to Bob's desired price, she's still not willing to come down to $8,000.  At this point, Bob is better off buying from John for $8,000.  He saves $100 compared to Alice's offer and avoids further negotiation."
