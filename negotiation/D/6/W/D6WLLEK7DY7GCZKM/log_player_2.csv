"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're getting started, I'd like to make you an offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great price, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get us started, and I think this price is a fair starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you and the effort I've put into acquiring it.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $875,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $887,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it holds for you and the effort I've put into acquiring it. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to close the deal. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to simply purchase the product from John for $800,000 and save $87,500.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield a significantly lower price."
