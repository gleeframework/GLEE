# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great opportunity for you. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** You'd save $2,000 by accepting Alice's offer.
* **You're still getting a good deal.**  The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and you're getting it for $10,000.  This means you're paying a fair price while still saving money."
