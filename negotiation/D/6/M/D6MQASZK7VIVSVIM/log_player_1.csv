"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is closer to Bob's perceived value but still allows room for negotiation.
* **Positive and engaging:** The message is friendly and expresses confidence in the product's suitability for Bob, hoping to build a good rapport. 
* **Leaving space for counter-offers:** This offer leaves room for Bob to counter without me immediately seeming unreasonable.

**Remember:** I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's $12,000 value as possible within the 10 rounds, while also keeping my minimum value of $8,000 in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal profit margin and I believe I can do better.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  We are only in the second round. There's room for negotiation and I can still potentially get a better price from Bob.
* **Selling to John is not the best option yet:**  While John offers a guaranteed $8,000, I'm still hopeful of getting closer to my desired price with Bob.

**Next Step:** I will counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($8,500). This shows willingness to compromise and hopefully encourages Bob to meet me in the middle.
* **Positive and persuasive:** The message is still friendly and focuses on finding a fair price that recognizes the product's value. 
* **Still above my minimum:**  This offer is still above my minimum of $8,000, so I'm not losing money if Bob accepts. 

**Goal:** I'm hoping this counteroffer will entice Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to keep negotiating if necessary.  I'm trying to maximize my profit while also remaining open to a reasonable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet at $8000? I'm really interested in this product and I think it's worth it to me at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:** Bob's offer is my absolute minimum, and while it's not ideal, it's not a loss.
* **Time is running out:** We are only in the fourth round, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob, especially since he seems to be firmly set on his offer. 
* **John offers a guaranteed deal:** Selling to John for $8,000 ensures a quick and certain sale. 

**Next Steps:** 
While I'm slightly disappointed I couldn't get closer to my desired price, I'm not losing money with this deal, and I'm securing a sale quickly. It's always important to be realistic about negotiation outcomes and to be willing to take a deal that's acceptable, especially when time is a factor."
