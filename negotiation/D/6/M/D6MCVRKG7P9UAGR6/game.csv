"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm motivated to sell, $8,000 is significantly below its value.  Could you meet me at $13,000? This offer reflects the product's worth and my willingness to negotiate.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,500. This is my final offer, and I'm counting on your response.",9500.0,Bob,4,
