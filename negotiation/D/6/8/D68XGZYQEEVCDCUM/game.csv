"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1200000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your perspective on the market value, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $900000. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and the value it can bring to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm proposing a price of $1000000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm proposing a price of $1100000. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident that the product will bring significant value to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a final offer of $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't agree on a price. I'd rather sell the product to someone who values it at its true worth. If you're not willing to meet me at $1100000, I think it's best to end our negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
