"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price!",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and your willingness to negotiate. Let's close this deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $850,000.
