"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $90.  You can likely get a better price, so it's worth trying to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $92. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're comfortable with. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as you're still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $87.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 87}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $95. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer is $95, which is still a bit higher than what you're comfortable with.  While you can keep negotiating, you've already gone back and forth several times, and it seems like Alice is firm on her price.  At this point, it's more efficient to buy the product from John for $120.  You're still getting a product you value at $120 for less than that, and you save the time and effort of further negotiation."
