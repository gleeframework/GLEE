Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a price closer to your $1,200,000 minimum.
* **John as Leverage:**  While not explicitly stated, the fact that you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price gives you negotiating power. 
* **Respect Bob's Valuation:**  Offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) acknowledges it's worth something to him while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message is framed as an ""initial proposal"" signaling  you're open to discussing the price further, encouraging Bob to engage."
