Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is significant, and I need to reflect that in the final price. I'm willing to accept $1,475,000. This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1475000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm introducing a sense of urgency and firmness in the negotiation. 
* **Slight Concession:** I am conceding slightly from my previous offer to show a willingness to compromise, but I'm holding firm above $1,450,000.
* **Justification:** Reminding Bob of the product's value reinforces my position that the price is justified.

This strategy aims to either secure a favorable deal with Bob or prompt him to reveal his absolute maximum price in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, after careful consideration, I would like to offer $1,460,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,460,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,460,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,460,000 is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield marginal gains, while increasing the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now allows me to re-invest the earnings sooner rather than later.

While I could push for a slightly higher price, the potential upside is outweighed by the risks and time involved.  Accepting Bob's offer at $1,460,000 secures a strong and timely profit."
