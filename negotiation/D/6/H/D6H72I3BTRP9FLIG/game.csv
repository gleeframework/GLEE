"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $100 is a good price, I'm looking for a little more to make this worthwhile for me. How about $105? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $105. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. That's my maximum budget for this product. Can you meet me there?,95.0,Bob,4,
