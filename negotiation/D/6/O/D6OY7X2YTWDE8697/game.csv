"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000. This is still a good price for you considering it's worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still find this a worthwhile investment.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
