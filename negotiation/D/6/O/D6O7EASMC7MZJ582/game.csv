"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product and its potential. However, $2000000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product and would be willing to pay $1200000. This reflects my maximum price point, but I believe it's still a fair value considering the potential benefits. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
