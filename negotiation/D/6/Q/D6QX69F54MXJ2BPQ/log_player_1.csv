{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a product worth $1,200,000 to you. My starting price is $1,100,000. Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a good starting point, but it's still a bit high for me. Given the value of this product to both of us, I'd like to propose a price of $1050000. This would allow us both to walk away with a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. While $1,050,000 is better than selling to John, I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value a fair deal, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  This would ensure both of us get a good deal, and we can finalize the transaction quickly. "", ""product_price"": 1075000}
