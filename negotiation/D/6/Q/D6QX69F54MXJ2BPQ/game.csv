"Alice, your initial offer is a good starting point, but it's still a bit high for me. Given the value of this product to both of us, I'd like to propose a price of $1050000. This would allow us both to walk away with a fair deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value a fair deal, $1050000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1075000?  This would ensure both of us get a good deal, and we can finalize the transaction quickly. ",1075000.0,Alice,3,
