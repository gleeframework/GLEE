Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and my initial assessment.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

Let's find common ground and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
