"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. Considering my maximum limit and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This offer reflects a fair compromise and allows us to proceed with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and my initial assessment. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this revised offer represents a significant concession on my part while still reflecting the inherent value of what's being offered."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, which is a substantial increase from my initial counteroffer. This price reflects a fair value considering my budget and the potential of the product.  Let's find common ground and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable compromise, it's still significantly less than John's guaranteed offer.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more substantial movement from Bob's side."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $1,600,000.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your investment."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is closer to my budget, but $1,600,000 is still a stretch. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial deal, as this price reflects the value I see in the product and my ability to invest. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum price.  He's made substantial moves, but we're still $300,000 apart. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000."
