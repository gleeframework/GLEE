"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be happy to pay $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've already given you a discount from my initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer $11,250. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",11250.0,Alice,3,
