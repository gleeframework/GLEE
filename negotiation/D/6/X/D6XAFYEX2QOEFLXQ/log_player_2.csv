"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While the product is potentially valuable, $1,400,000 is close to my maximum budget. 
* **Negotiation is necessary:**  There's room for negotiation to lower the price and save money.
* **John's offer is a fallback:**  Having John's offer as a fallback gives me leverage to potentially secure a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While this product holds significant value, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price fairly reflects its unique qualities and potential return on investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While it's closer to my budget, $1,350,000 is still more than I'd like to pay.
* **Further negotiation is possible:** There's still room to negotiate a lower price, especially since I have a fallback option with John. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Having John's offer at $1,500,000 gives me the flexibility to reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating without the risk of losing out on the product entirely."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However,  $1,350,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
