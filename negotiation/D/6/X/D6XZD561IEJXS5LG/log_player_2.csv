Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to work with you. I can offer you the product for $82. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $76, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I can offer you the product for $81. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $81. Since you can get the product for $80 from John, it makes more sense to cut your losses and buy from John.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a higher risk of exceeding your $80 budget."
