Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $95 tempts Bob with a price that's higher than his perceived value ($80) but potentially attractive compared to missing out.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, starting slightly higher leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $95. If he rejects the offer, you still have the security of selling to John for your minimum acceptable price."
