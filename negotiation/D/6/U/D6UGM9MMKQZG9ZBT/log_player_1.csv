Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum:**  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **It shows confidence in the product's value:** This might make Bob more likely to take the offer seriously.

However, I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffers are too low.  I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, but it's still within a range that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial asking price.  I hope this will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not quite there.  I'm going to reject his offer and make one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000, which is only $100,000 above Bob's last offer. This shows that I'm willing to make a concession, but I'm still holding firm on my bottom line. If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiation.  It's clear that Bob is not willing to come up to my desired price, and I'm not comfortable selling for significantly less than my minimum.  Therefore, I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000."
