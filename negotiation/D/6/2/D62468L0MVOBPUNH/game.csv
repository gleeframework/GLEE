"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,500 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. How about $10,250? This is a fair price that considers your budget and my minimum threshold.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $10,000? I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
