{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try and get a better price than $90.  Even though John will pay $80, I think I can still get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $105? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, so I can do $95. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to keep negotiating, Bob's offer of $95 is pretty close to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing him entirely. It's better to take the $95 now than to risk getting nothing at all."
