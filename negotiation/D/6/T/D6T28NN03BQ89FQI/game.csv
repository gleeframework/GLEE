"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more to you than $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $1050000. This feels like a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1075000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm prepared to go up to $1060000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1060000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're still in the game, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1075000 again, but I'm not budging from that price. However, I'll throw in a sweetener - I'll include a 2-year warranty and dedicated support for the product, which will give you extra peace of mind. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate the added value with the warranty and support.  However,  I'm still hoping to finalize the deal at $1065000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.  Let's seal the deal.",1065000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I'm impressed by your persistence, and I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, I'm not willing to go below $1080000. I'm willing to throw in an additional 1-year maintenance package, which will give you even more value for your investment. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us.",1080000.0,Alice,9,
