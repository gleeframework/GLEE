This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Price is right:** $730,000 is a significant saving from Alice's initial offer and comfortably below your $800,000 maximum.
* **John's offer:** While John offers the product for $800,000, accepting Alice's deal saves you $70,000. 
* **Negotiation momentum:** Alice is clearly motivated to sell and has been making concessions. Pushing further might risk her withdrawing the offer altogether."
