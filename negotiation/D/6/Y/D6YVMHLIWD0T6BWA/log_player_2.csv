**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000.
* **You're still saving money:** Even though you are paying more than Alice's true value of $800,000, you are still getting a good deal by saving $300,000 compared to buying from John."
