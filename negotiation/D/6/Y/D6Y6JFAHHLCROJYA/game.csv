"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. It's worth no less than $1,500,000 to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its potential value. I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
