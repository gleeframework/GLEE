"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $8,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $8,500. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $9,500 is still more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm offering $9,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm not willing to go that low just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $9,000. I'm offering it to you for $9,250. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",9250.0,Alice,7,
