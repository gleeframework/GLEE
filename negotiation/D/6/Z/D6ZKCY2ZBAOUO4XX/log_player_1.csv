Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a price of $170. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows me to potentially gain a significant profit margin if Bob accepts. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob doesn't accept the initial offer, it opens the door for negotiation. He might counter-offer, giving me a chance to still sell above my minimum price of $120.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  I have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $120. This allows me to be more ambitious with my initial offer to Bob. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring the product is sold."
