,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9000 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10500? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm still leaving room for some profit.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to be at a lower price. How about $9500? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase if we can meet at this price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $9500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10000. That way, we both get a fair price and I can move on to other opportunities.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $9000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase if we can meet at this price.",9000.0,Bob,6,
