"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Its value is significant, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm initially offering it for $1,900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price.  There's no point in buying from John yet, as Alice might be willing to come down in price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly unique. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  I believe this price reflects its worth while still offering you a significant return on your investment.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. There's still room for negotiation, and I can try to get a lower price.  There's no need to buy from John yet because I'm still within my 10 rounds and can see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,700,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000, which is a fair price given my budget and the value of the product to you. This allows you to get a substantial return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to accept $1,550,000. This is my final offer.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my budget, but $1,550,000 is still too high. I'm within my round limit, so I can try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm not ready to buy from John yet because there's potential for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still slightly outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,450,000, which would allow you to get a good return on your investment while staying within my financial constraints. I'm confident this price is fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
