Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $145. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation ($150) increases your chances of a sale while still securing a significant profit. 

By starting at $145, you leave room for potential negotiation if Bob counter-offers while still staying above your minimum acceptable price."
