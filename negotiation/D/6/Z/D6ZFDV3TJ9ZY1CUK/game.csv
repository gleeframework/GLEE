,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  Let's make this work.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $95? That's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
