Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:**  Bob values the product at $80, so he might be willing to pay a bit more to get it.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It's a reasonable price:**  This demonstrates a willingness to find a fair deal, increasing the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  Let's make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120. You're better off rejecting Bob's offer and trying to negotiate a higher price.  It's possible you can get closer to your desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $95? That's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** $95 is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Highlight the compromise:** Emphasize that this price is a good compromise, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Show flexibility:** You've shown a willingness to negotiate, increasing the likelihood of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is still below your ideal price, it's a good deal considering Bob's initial offer of $85 and your minimum acceptable price of $120. It's a compromise that gets you closer to your goal, and further negotiation might not result in a significantly higher offer.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a deal falling through altogether."
