"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is significantly below what I need to sell it for.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This gives you a good price and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground here.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is a fair price that takes both our needs into account. If you're serious about buying the product, I believe this is a price we can agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal from John at your target price."
