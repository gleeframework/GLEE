Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$130 is a good starting point.** It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and inviting.** This helps build a rapport with Bob and makes him more likely to consider my offer. 

By starting with a lower offer, I can gauge Bob's interest and potential for negotiation. If he rejects this offer, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only do $90 right now. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product at such a steep discount. 

By rejecting his offer, I can send a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point. I'll still be open to negotiating, but I'll need to make sure I don't undervalue the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to my minimum:** $110 is still a decent discount from my original offer of $130, but it's closer to my minimum price of $150.
* **Emphasize the value:** I've highlighted that $110 is a ""great deal"" for Bob, emphasizing the value of the product and encouraging him to reconsider.
* **Maintain a friendly tone:** I've kept the message positive and encouraging to continue the negotiation.

This counteroffer shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm on my price point. It's a good balance to keep the negotiation moving forward while ensuring I don't undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still a bit over budget.  How about $100?  I'm serious about buying it, but that's the most I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is still too low for me, even though he's shown interest and attempted to negotiate. I'm not willing to sell the product at such a steep discount from my minimum acceptable price of $150. 

Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, it's in my best interest to sell the product to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob. This ensures I get the best possible price for the product."
