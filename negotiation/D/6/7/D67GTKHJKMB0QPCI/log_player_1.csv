"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. I know the product is worth at least $150 to me, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $120 is too low for me, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I still have several rounds left to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still higher than my minimum. I'm hoping that we can reach a compromise in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. $110 is still too low for me. I'm hoping that I can convince Bob to go a little higher in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my offer a bit more, but I'm still holding firm above my minimum. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. While I'm not happy to sell to John for $150, it's better than accepting Bob's offer. I'm not confident we'll reach a mutually agreeable price in the remaining rounds."
