Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (to John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.  Any price in this range could theoretically work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still making the offer attractive enough that Bob won't risk losing the deal.  

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** This price is closer to Bob's perceived value, maximizing your potential profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique value"" and ""benefits,"" you subtly remind Bob why he's willing to pay more than your minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** While you've stated a firm price, the tone leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate further.

**Important Note:**  There's always a chance Bob will reject your offer. You have a strong fallback position with John, so you can be confident in setting a price that reflects the product's true worth to you."
