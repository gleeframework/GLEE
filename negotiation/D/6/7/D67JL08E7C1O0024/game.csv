"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $800,000 is a bit high for me at this moment. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's aim for a price closer to $650,000. This would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $675,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value this product will bring to your business.",675000.0,Alice,5,
