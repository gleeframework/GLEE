{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than your minimum threshold of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential profit of $4,000.  It also frames the offer as a win-win situation for both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my original offer to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a great opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can strike a deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is a good compromise. It's close to my desired price, and selling to John for $8,000 would result in a lower profit. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a decent profit while securing the sale."
