"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to make a serious offer.

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and your budget, and I believe it's a fair price for both parties.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $900,000? It's a significant step closer to my budget, and it still allows you to make a good profit. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $900,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and your budget, and I believe it's a fair price for both parties.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
