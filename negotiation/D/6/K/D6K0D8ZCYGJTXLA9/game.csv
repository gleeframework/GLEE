"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for this product, let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $155 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135? This would be a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $145. I'm willing to make one more offer: I'll sell the product to you for $145, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,
