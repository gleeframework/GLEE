"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $950000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really hoping to get this product for $875000. It's a good deal for both of us - I get a fair price, and you're still making a healthy profit. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $925000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering the product to you for $912500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",912500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $912500 is still a little too high for me. I'm feeling like $887500 would be a fair compromise that benefits us both. It's closer to my desired price, and it's still a profitable deal for you.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",887500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $920000. I've already come down significantly from my initial offer, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering the product to you for $905000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think?",905000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $905000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $895000, which is a fair price for both of us.  We're getting very close to a deal, and this is my final offer. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement before I have to consider other options.",895000.0,Bob,8,
