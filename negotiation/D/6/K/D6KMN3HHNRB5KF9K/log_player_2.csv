"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $950,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really hoping to get this product for $875,000. It's a good deal for both of us - I get a fair price, and you're still making a healthy profit. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Move:**  This offer is a smaller increase from your previous offer, showing that you're serious about making a deal but not willing to budge too much.
