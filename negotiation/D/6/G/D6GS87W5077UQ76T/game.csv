"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within a budget of $120 for this product. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to my budget?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $130?  This price still gives you a good value, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still aiming to keep the cost below $120. Could we possibly agree on a price of $115? This would allow us to both feel satisfied with the transaction.",115.0,Bob,4,
