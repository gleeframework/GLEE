"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product for $115. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first.  We can always go to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It looks like a nice product, but $115 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

This counter-offer is a starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also gives Alice a chance to explain why the product is worth a higher price to her. We'll see how she responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $95? Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, which is good. However, we're still close to our maximum budget and might be able to get it lower. Let's try negotiating one more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for getting back to me Alice. I can appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $90, and we have a deal?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

We're pushing closer to our limit and giving Alice a chance to accept a price that's still beneficial for her compared to our alternative. By proposing a specific number and calling it a ""deal"", we're signaling that this is likely our final offer."
