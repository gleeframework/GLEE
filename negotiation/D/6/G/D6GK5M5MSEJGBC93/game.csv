"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. ",140.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer,  $135 is still a bit below where I need to be. How about we split the difference at $137? It's a fair price that acknowledges both of our positions.",137.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your position. To be completely transparent, $136 is still just a bit too low for me. How about we finalize this at $138? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",138.0,Alice,7,
