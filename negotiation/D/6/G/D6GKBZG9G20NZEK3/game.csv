"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,750 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen!",10000.0,Alice,5,
