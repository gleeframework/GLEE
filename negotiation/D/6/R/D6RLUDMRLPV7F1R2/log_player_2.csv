"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $11,500.  I believe this is a fair price considering what you gain. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to you:** You are willing to pay up to $12,000, but Alice is asking for $11,500.
* **John's offer is your fallback:**  If you reject Alice, you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $12,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but you have no guarantee she will agree.  Since John is your backup, you don't need to rush into a decision."
