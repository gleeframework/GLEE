Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 might be a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your negotiating spirit, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $97.50. I can offer you $101, which is a bit closer to my original price. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:

At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower and the difference is minimal. It's better to secure the deal at $101 than risk further negotiation."
