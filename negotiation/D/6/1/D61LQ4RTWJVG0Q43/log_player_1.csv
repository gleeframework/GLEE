Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $10,000.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't let it go for that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still stuck at $10,000.  It's my absolute limit. If you're willing to go there, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to look elsewhere.

**Reasoning:** Bob is firm at his $10,000 offer.  While I could counter again, it's unlikely he'll budge and I risk losing both Bob and John's guaranteed $10,000. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed sale with John."
