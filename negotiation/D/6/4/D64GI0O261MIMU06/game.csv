"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but no higher. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $15000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but I think I can do better than that. I'll make a final offer of $12500. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,6,
