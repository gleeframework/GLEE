"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than John's offer. There is ample room for negotiation to potentially buy the product for less than $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,050,000."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer allows for more room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below John's offer. Aiming for around 70% of Alice's initial offer is a common starting point in negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,200,000.
