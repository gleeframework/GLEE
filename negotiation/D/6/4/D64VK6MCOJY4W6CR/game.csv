"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $9,500? This would still be a great deal for you, as you're getting a quality product for significantly less than you would elsewhere. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal. What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,4,
