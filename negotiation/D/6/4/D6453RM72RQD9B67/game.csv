"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15,000 is quite high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell the product for. I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute limit.",9000.0,Bob,4,
