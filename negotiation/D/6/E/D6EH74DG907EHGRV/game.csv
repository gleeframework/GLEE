"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's fair given my budget and the product's potential.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This price reflects a substantial discount while still acknowledging the product's worth.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on the value of this product, but  $1,025,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm prepared to go up to $950,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down slightly further.  How about $980,000? I believe this represents a very competitive price while still reflecting the true value of the product. ",980000.0,Alice,5,
