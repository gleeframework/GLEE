Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
