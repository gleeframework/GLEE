I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. This will give Alice some room to negotiate while still ensuring that I'm getting a good deal."

Alice's offer is now within my budget and closer to my desired price.  It's a good deal considering I can buy from John for $10,000.  I'll accept the offer to avoid further negotiation and ensure I get the product."
