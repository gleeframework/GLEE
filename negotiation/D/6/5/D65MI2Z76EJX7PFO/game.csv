"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is quite high, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its potential.  I'm asking for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my own investment in it. Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
