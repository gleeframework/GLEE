"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and open to discussion.  This should hopefully start the negotiation in a positive way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and would like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price.  There are still 8 rounds left, so there's time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $10,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 10750}
``` 

I'm trying to find a middle ground by splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still maintain a price that's closer to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,500. I hope this is within your range and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not happy with Bob's offer. $10,500 is too far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go any lower than $11,000. This would give you a good deal, and it's the best I can offer at this point."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still leaves me with a reasonable profit.  I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer, hoping to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've been considering our previous offers and I would like to propose an offer of $10,800. I believe this is a fair price for both parties and I hope it will lead to a successful transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $10,800 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before seriously considering selling to John.  I've already come down quite a bit, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I'm feeling generous today, so I'm willing to come down to $11,250. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

I'm offering a price that's significantly closer to Bob's last offer, but it's still within my acceptable range.  I'm also expressing optimism and a desire to close the deal, hoping to nudge Bob towards acceptance.  We've only got a few rounds left, and I want to see if we can reach an agreement before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I would like to counter with an offer of $11,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are in round 8, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum price.  While I could continue negotiating, it's getting late in the game, and I'm not sure if we'll reach an agreement.  It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John than to risk getting a lower price from Bob."
