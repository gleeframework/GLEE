"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we begin our negotiation, I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get this product at a discount, and I believe it's a fair starting point. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still $100,000 above my target. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price and save even more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is just $25,000 more than my target price of $1,050,000.  At this point, it's probably not worth risking losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  I've saved a significant amount of money compared to John's price, and it seems like this is the best deal I'm likely to get."
