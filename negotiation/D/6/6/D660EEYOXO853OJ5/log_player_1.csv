Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. However, I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts.  I believe this product can be a significant asset to you, and I want to ensure we find a mutually beneficial arrangement."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message focuses on the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price and potentially shift Bob's perception of the product's worth.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  Indicating flexibility and a willingness to discuss the price encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,500,000 provides a strong fallback position, allowing Alice to be firm in negotiations with Bob.

By setting a high initial offer and using persuasive language, Alice increases the chances of securing a deal closer to her desired price while still leaving room for a mutually agreeable outcome."
