{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This price is a compromise between my minimum desired price ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($12,000). 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. It also leaves room for negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Start high:** I'm starting at a price closer to my minimum desired price, aiming to maximize profit. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  I acknowledge that $14,000 may be a stretch for Bob, so I leave space for him to counteroffer. 
* **Be prepared to walk away:** I'm willing to sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see some flexibility on the price. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is still below my minimum desired price of $15,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product for me. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opportunity cost:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a higher profit than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to retain some negotiating power and potentially secure a better price in the next round.

**Next step:**

I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum desired price while still considering Bob's willingness to pay a premium."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium, $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair price for both of us. It's a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's still a good deal considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $13,500, which is halfway between my initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,500. 
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer while emphasizing my need for a higher price. I also highlight the value of the product and the significant discount from my initial offer.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while maintaining my desired profit margin. It also opens the door for further negotiation if Bob is still hesitant.

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing profit and deal:**  $13,500 allows me to earn a decent profit while still being competitive with Bob's offer.
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving room for Bob to potentially counteroffer again, without risking a stalemate.
* **Clear communication:** The message is direct and clear about my position, encouraging Bob to consider a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, and I appreciate the discount. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is still below my ideal price of $15,000, it's very close and represents a significant compromise from Bob.  Given the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal entirely, accepting this offer seems like the best course of action.

**Reasoning:**

* **Value of the deal:**  $13,000 is a decent profit and a strong outcome given the negotiation.
* **Avoiding risk:**  Further negotiation might result in a lower price or a stalemate, potentially leading me to sell to John for $15,000.
* **Time constraint:** The prompt doesn't specify a time limit for negotiations, but continuing to bargain could be time-consuming. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a good deal with minimal risk and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
