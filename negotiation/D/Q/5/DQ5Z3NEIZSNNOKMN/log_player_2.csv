Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium, $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair price for both of us. It's a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's still a good deal considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.
