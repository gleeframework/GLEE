{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking $90 for it, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $90, which is slightly higher than the value Bob places on the product. This gives me some room to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $65 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value for the product.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $72.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 72.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$70 is a good price and very close to my minimum value for the product.  It's better than selling to John for $80, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
