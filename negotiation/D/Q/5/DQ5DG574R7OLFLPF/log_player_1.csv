Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further.  However, I also have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with a price of $140. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum.  I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely I'll get a better offer from Bob.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120, which is a better outcome for me than accepting Bob's offer."
