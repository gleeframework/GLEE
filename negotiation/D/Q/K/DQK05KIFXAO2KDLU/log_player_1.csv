"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $120, which is a decent markup from my minimum acceptable price of $150. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm subtly suggesting the product is worth more than $120 to make the offer seem more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. I would like to offer $90 for the product. I hope this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and doesn't come close to my initial offer of $120. 
* **Negotiation room:** I still have 9 rounds to close the deal and find a more agreeable price. 
* **Selling to John is not optimal:** While selling to John guarantees $150, I'm aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a great price for you, and it's closer to my initial offer. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping the price above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while also maintaining my value.
* **Positive language:**  I'm reiterating that the product is a good deal for Bob and that I want to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  This counteroffer allows for more negotiation in the next rounds if Bob is still hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to counter with $100 for the product. I hope this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's closer, it's not yet a profitable deal for me.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  There are still 6 rounds left. Bob is demonstrating willingness to negotiate, so there's a possibility he'll offer a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's offer is still a safety net:** While I'd prefer to get more from Bob, John's offer remains a fallback option if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $102. This is a fair price for both of us, and it leaves room for a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 102}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:**  I'm making a small concession to show flexibility and encourage Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm focusing on finding a price that is fair for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Remaining above minimum:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, but leaving room for a potential compromise in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with $98 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $98 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's closer, it's not yet a profitable deal for me.
* **Time is running out:**  We are approaching the midpoint of our negotiation. It's important to maintain my position while considering the time constraint. 
* **John's offer is a strong backup:**  If I can't reach a better deal with Bob, John's offer remains a safe and profitable alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  we're getting close! I'm willing to go to $100 for this.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm making a final offer at $100, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by stating that this is my final offer. This might encourage Bob to accept.
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language and focusing on closing the deal to increase the chances of acceptance. 
* **John's offer is still an option:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John, but I'm hoping to secure a slightly better price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I would like to counter with $95 for the product. I hope this aligns better with our respective values. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are in round 8, with only 2 rounds remaining.  
* **Below minimum:**  Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Risk of losing value:**  If I keep negotiating, there's a significant risk that Bob will continue lowering his offer, and I might end up with a price even lower than $95.
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is my minimum acceptable price and a more profitable deal than what Bob is offering. 

With only two rounds left, the risk of not getting a better deal from Bob is high. Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit and minimizes the chance of ending up with an unprofitable outcome."
