Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. It's clear we both see the value in this product. To be transparent, I have another interested buyer at a higher price point. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and that might be you. I'm willing to accept $1,150,000. This is my final offer. If it's agreeable to you, we have a deal. If not, I'll need to move forward with the other buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

This is a tough spot. Alice is playing hardball and likely bluffing about the other buyer. However, her price is still significantly higher than John's offer.  You've made good progress in the negotiation, but it's not worth the risk of her following through with the ""other buyer"".  Buying from John guarantees you get the product at the best possible price for your budget."
