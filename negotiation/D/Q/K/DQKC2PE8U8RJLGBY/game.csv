"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more in the range of $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your perspective, $800,000 is considerably below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This reflects the product's unique qualities and potential ROI for you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,400,000 is still too far out for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm aiming for a price that benefits us both. While I'm open to moving closer to your range, $900,000 remains significantly below the product's value. To find a middle ground, I propose $1,250,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While that price is getting more reasonable, I need to see it closer to my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000 to get this done.  What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. It's clear we both see the value in this product. To be transparent, I have another interested buyer at a higher price point. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and that might be you. I'm willing to accept $1,150,000. This is my final offer. If it's agreeable to you, we have a deal. If not, I'll need to move forward with the other buyer.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
