"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This establishes a firm starting point and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's worth, justifying the high price.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** While starting high, I signal willingness to discuss the price, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more in the range of $800,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value of the product. Accepting now would be a substantial loss. While his counter is aggressive, it indicates he's interested. I'll counter to steer the negotiation closer to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your perspective, $800,000 is considerably below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This reflects the product's unique qualities and potential ROI for you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection & Explanation:** I'm explicitly rejecting Bob's offer and explaining why it's unacceptable. 
* **Significant but Strategic Drop:** The counteroffer of $1,400,000 is a $200,000 decrease, showing flexibility, but it's still firmly above both my minimum and Bob's initial assessment.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the higher price point. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to guide the negotiation towards a mutually agreeable middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,400,000 is still too far out for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, which is a positive sign. However, $900,000 is still significantly below my $1,200,000 minimum.  I need to show him I'm willing to negotiate but not at the cost of a substantial loss. I'll continue the negotiation to explore if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm aiming for a price that benefits us both. While I'm open to moving closer to your range, $900,000 remains significantly below the product's value. To find a middle ground, I propose $1,250,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** Recognizing Bob's movement keeps the negotiation positive.
* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer holds close to my $1,200,000 minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate within a reasonable range.
* **Value Justification:**  Reiterating the product's value reinforces why my price isn't arbitrarily high.
* **Urgency (Implied):**  Moving closer to my minimum subtly implies I might accept John's offer if a deal can't be reached soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While that price is getting more reasonable, I need to see it closer to my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000 to get this done.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offers, which demonstrates his commitment to acquiring the product. However, $950,000 is still below my absolute minimum. It appears unlikely he'll drastically increase his offer to reach my target range. I will continue negotiating, but I'm getting closer to accepting John's offer to avoid wasting time on a deal that might not materialize."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. It's clear we both see the value in this product. To be transparent, I have another interested buyer at a higher price point. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and that might be you. I'm willing to accept $1,150,000. This is my final offer. If it's agreeable to you, we have a deal. If not, I'll need to move forward with the other buyer."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Urgency:** I'm creating a sense of urgency by mentioning John's offer, making it clear that time is of the essence.
* **Final Offer:**  This firmly communicates that $1,150,000 is my absolute bottom line.
* **Simplified Choice:** I'm presenting Bob with a clear yes-or-no scenario, encouraging a decision.
* **Balance:** This price allows for a small profit margin for Bob (based on his perceived value) while still exceeding my minimum."
