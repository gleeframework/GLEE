"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree the product is valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Could you do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $975,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's value.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $975,000 is a significant investment for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
