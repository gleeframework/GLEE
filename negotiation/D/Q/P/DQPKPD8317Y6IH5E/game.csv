"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I believe it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This reflects the unique value and benefits it brings. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think the product is a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and other similar products.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your offer, it's below my minimum price point. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850,000. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay that much. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $775,000 is still not a viable price for me. I'm willing to go a little lower, but I need to be able to cover my costs. Let's split the difference.  I'm proposing $825,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's unique value. Let's close this deal and make it mutually beneficial.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your concerns about covering costs, but I'm still not comfortable with $825,000. I'm willing to pay $790,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I hope we can meet in the middle and come to an agreement.",790000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $790,000 is getting close to my minimum price point, but I'm still a bit off.  Let's try $805,000.  This is a reasonable price considering the value of the product and the potential benefits you'll gain.  I think this is a fair and mutually beneficial outcome for both of us.",805000.0,Alice,7,
