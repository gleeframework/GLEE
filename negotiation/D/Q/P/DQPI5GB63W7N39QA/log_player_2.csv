"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can likely get a better deal than $110 since Alice values the product at $100. Rejecting her offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'd be willing to pay $105 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $107.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is now offering $107.5, which is still above your desired price of $105. You can continue to negotiate, hoping to reach a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but I'm still aiming for $105. It's closer to what I can reasonably spend right now.  I'm confident you can make a good profit at that price, and I'd be happy to take it off your hands."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still looking to make a decent profit on this product. I can offer it to you for $106.50. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $106.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $106.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $106.5, which is only $1.5 above your ideal price of $105. At this point, it's likely worth accepting her offer.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to further price reductions, but it also risks losing the deal entirely. You're already very close to your target price, so accepting the offer is the more practical option."
