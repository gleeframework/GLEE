Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value, knowing Bob has a lower valuation.  This sets the stage for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to pay something closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm offering a price that's still above Bob's valuation but closer to his offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that allows me to make a good profit while keeping the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While it's tempting to go with the $900,000, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $1,500,000. I'll try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to offer a price slightly lower than my previous counteroffer, but still significantly above Bob's last offer. I'm trying to find a compromise that will allow us to reach an agreement without pushing Bob away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  While I'm willing to negotiate, it's clear that we're not going to agree on a price that's acceptable to me. It's time to move on and sell the product to John for my desired price."
