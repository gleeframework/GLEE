Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

While Bob's offer is closer to my target, it's still lower than I'd like to accept. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise again.  I'm willing to lower the price to $790,000.

While I'm getting closer to a deal with Bob, we're approaching the halfway point of the negotiations. To ensure I secure a sale, I'll accept John's offer of $800,000. This guarantees me a good price for the product and avoids further risk of a potential unsuccessful negotiation."
