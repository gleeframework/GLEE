"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the $950,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a compromise here. While $975,000 is still below my ideal price, I'm willing to accept $1,000,000. This offer reflects the absolute lowest I'm willing to go.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
