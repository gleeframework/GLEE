Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice knows she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000. Therefore, she should start negotiations with Bob significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) to maximize her potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,100,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value and potential"", Alice provides a soft justification for the high price without revealing her absolute bottom line. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still exceeding Alice's minimum acceptable price."
