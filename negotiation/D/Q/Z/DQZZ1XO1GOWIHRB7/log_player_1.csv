Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it would be a valuable asset for your business as well. My initial offer is $900,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $900,000 is a good starting point. It's below my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and enthusiastic tone can help build rapport and encourage Bob to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the product's worth to Bob emphasizes the potential benefit of the deal.

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize Profits:**  $900,000 is a substantial profit for me.
* **Encourage Negotiation:**  A starting point that isn't immediately rejected gives Bob room to counter, keeping the negotiation going.
* **Maintain Flexibility:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can lower it slightly or use John's offer as a benchmark to ensure I don't settle for less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $850,000 is close to Bob's perceived value of the product, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.
* **John's offer provides a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain my desired profit margin:**  I'm not willing to settle for less than what the product is worth to me.
* **Explore a higher counteroffer:**  I can propose a price closer to my initial offer, potentially securing a more favorable deal.
* **Avoid settling too quickly:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm confident in the value of the product and won't be pressured into a quick sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite there yet. Given the value of this product, I'm prepared to come down a bit further. How about $875,000? This price is still fair considering the benefits you'll gain, and it brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a smaller reduction:**  I'm lowering my price from $900,000 to $875,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Reiterate the product's value:**  I remind Bob of the benefits he'll receive, justifying the price.
* **Focus on reaching a mutually beneficial agreement:**  This emphasizes that a deal is possible while still maintaining my position.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain a reasonable profit margin:**  $875,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but closer to his perceived value.
* **Signal a willingness to negotiate:**  This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm willing to work with him to reach a deal.
* **Position myself for a potential acceptance:**  This price point is a good compromise that Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $825000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $825,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome:**  I've already lowered my price twice, and Bob's counteroffers are getting increasingly unreasonable. 
* **John's offer guarantees my desired profit:**  Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:**

By selling to John, I:

* **Maximize my profit:**  $1,000,000 is the best possible outcome for me.
* **Avoid potential delays and complications:**  Further negotiation with Bob could be time-consuming and ultimately unproductive.
* **Minimize risk:**  Selling to John ensures I receive a guaranteed payment and don't have to worry about Bob potentially backing out."
