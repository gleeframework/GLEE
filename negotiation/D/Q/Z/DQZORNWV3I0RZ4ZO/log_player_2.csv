"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's initial offer is $10,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.
* It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds left to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible.
* A counteroffer of $7,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's seriousness in buying the product, while also setting a clear price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* While $9,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than the $8,000 he could get from John.
* There are still 7 rounds left, so there's time for further negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue exploring a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is trying to get the best deal possible while staying within his budget.
* Alice's offer of $9,000 is closer to Bob's limit, but he's still trying to get a better price.
* Increasing his offer to $7,500 demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still remaining under his $8,000 limit. 
* This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving toward a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $8,500 is close to Bob's limit, but still higher than what he could get from John.
* There are still 5 rounds left, so Bob can continue trying to negotiate a lower price.
* This offer might be a sign that Alice is getting closer to Bob's price range, making continued negotiation potentially worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is now at his maximum budget of $8,000.
* Alice's previous offer of $8,500 was very close, and it seems likely she is willing to compromise.
* Making a counteroffer of $8,000 shows Bob's willingness to meet her halfway, potentially leading to a final agreement. 
* If Alice rejects this offer, there are still 4 rounds left, but Bob has little room to negotiate further."
