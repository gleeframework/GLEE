"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This represents a significant savings for you and allows me to still make a profit. Please let me know if you're interested.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
