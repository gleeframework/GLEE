# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. I am willing to consider $10,750 as the price for the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. Considering the value of the product and your budget, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose a price of $10,650 for the product. This represents a fair compromise that benefits both parties. I hope this offer meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,650
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price:** $10,650 is only $650 more than Bob's ideal price of $10,000. This is a relatively small difference considering the potential savings compared to buying from John.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  The negotiation has gone through multiple rounds, and further counteroffers might not yield significant additional savings. There's a risk of Alice getting frustrated and sticking to her current offer.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate could take up more time and potentially lead to missing out on a good deal with Alice.

Overall, accepting the offer seems like the most sensible choice at this point. It balances the desire for savings with the risk of losing the deal or getting a worse price later."
