"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1100000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1200000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1250000?  This allows for a significant profit for you and is still fair to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1250000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1200000? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
