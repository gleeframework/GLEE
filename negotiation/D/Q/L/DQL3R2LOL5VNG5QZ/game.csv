"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that is worth at least $1500000 to me.  I believe this product has significant potential for you, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us.  Please consider my offer of $1750000. This represents a significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of acquiring it. If this price isn't agreeable, I'll be happy to sell it to another buyer for $1500000, but I believe you'll see the value in this offer. ",1750000.0,Alice,1,
