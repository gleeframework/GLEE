"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that is worth at least $1500000 to me.  I believe this product has significant potential for you, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us.  Please consider my offer of $1750000. This represents a significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of acquiring it. If this price isn't agreeable, I'll be happy to sell it to another buyer for $1500000, but I believe you'll see the value in this offer.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product. Alice's offer of $1,750,000 exceeds your maximum budget. While she mentions the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to her, that doesn't necessarily mean it's worth more to you.  It's always better to stick to your budget and get a better deal from John."
