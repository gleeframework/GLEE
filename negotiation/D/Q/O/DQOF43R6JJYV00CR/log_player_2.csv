"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! It's a high-quality item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $6,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $6,500 is a good deal, it's still worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price. You have 9 more rounds, so there's time to explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $5,500. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 5500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $6,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $6,000, which is a good price for Bob. It's a decent compromise that saves Bob $2,000 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might yield a slightly lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential small savings."
