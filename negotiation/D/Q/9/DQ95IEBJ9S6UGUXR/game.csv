"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know is of great value to your business. My asking price is $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's worth and allows for a profitable margin for both of us. I'm confident this is a fair offer, but I'm open to discussing it further.  What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,200,000. I would like to propose an alternative price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the product's worth while also aligning with my financial capabilities. I look forward to your response.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your budget constraints, $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This still allows me to profit from the sale while acknowledging the value you see in the product. I believe this is a fair compromise and hope we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
