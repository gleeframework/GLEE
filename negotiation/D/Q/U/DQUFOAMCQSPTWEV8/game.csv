"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $850,000 is below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, considering your interest.  This is a substantial price reduction from my initial offer. Let's try to find a compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,000,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
