"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value and my needs. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet halfway. How about $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $800,000, which is a fair price given my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
