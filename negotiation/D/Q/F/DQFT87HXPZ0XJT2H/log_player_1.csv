Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,750,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.  Please let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** There's a chance Bob values the product even more than you do or is willing to pay a premium for immediate acquisition. Starting high allows you to gauge his interest and potentially secure a significantly higher profit.
* **Fallback Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with selling to John at your desired minimum price."
