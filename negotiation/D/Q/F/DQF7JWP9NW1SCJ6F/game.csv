"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make a profit. How about $105? It's still a good deal for you, considering the product is worth $100 to you. Let's make this happen.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $95 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to go down to $100, which is what the product is worth to me.  It's a fair price, and it allows me to make a small profit.  Let's close this deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
