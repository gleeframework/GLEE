"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that's significantly lower than its true worth to me.  I understand it holds great value to you as well, at $800,000.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000, which allows you a substantial profit margin while still ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  Consider this a chance to secure a valuable asset at a price that's both attractive and mutually beneficial.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
