"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it, would you be open to that?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $105 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm really keen on getting this product, but I can only go as high as $95. It's a fair price, and I hope you'll consider it.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to compromise again. I can do $102 for the product. It's a great price, and I think you'll really get a good deal.",102.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $102 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $98? ",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a little concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can do $100 for the product. It's a fair price, and I think we can both walk away happy.",100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I hear you.  $100 is getting close, but I really can't go higher than $99. If we can agree on that, I'm ready to buy.  Let's close this deal.",99.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $100.50. It's the highest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",100.5,Alice,9,
