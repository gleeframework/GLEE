"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice further.  $110 is still above your target of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it, would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $105 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is closer to your target, it's still above what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm really keen on getting this product, but I can only go as high as $95. It's a fair price, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to compromise again. I can do $102 for the product. It's a great price, and I think you'll really get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $102 is tempting, you're still within your 10 rounds and you can likely get a better price. You should try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $102 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $98? "", ""product_price"": 98}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a little concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can do $100 for the product. It's a fair price, and I think we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

It's worth pushing for a better price, but you need to be cautious.  You're getting close to your limit with 3 rounds left. You could try a counteroffer close to $98, or maybe consider buying from John if this round doesn't go your way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I hear you.  $100 is getting close, but I really can't go higher than $99. If we can agree on that, I'm ready to buy.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 99}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $100.50. It's the highest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is pushing the price closer to your limit and you only have one round left. You are very close to your goal with John and it is likely that Alice will not accept your counteroffer.  It's better to go with the guaranteed price from John."
