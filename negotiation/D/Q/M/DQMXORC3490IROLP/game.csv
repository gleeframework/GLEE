"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to your offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $10,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,200 and $9,800. I'll sell the product to you for $10,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
