"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your target price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value and the initial offer I made, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, but also acknowledges your willingness to negotiate. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you be open to $750,000? I feel that's a fair price that reflects the value while working for my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,
