"I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I can meet you in the middle at $825,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your target, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can offer you a compromise at $775,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",775000.0,Alice,5,
