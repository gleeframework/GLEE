I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's a reasonable markup from my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

$8,000 is far too low. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and agree to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a little higher with a counteroffer."

I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a small concession, but I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about making a deal and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm getting the feeling that we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's a secure sale and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower offer."
