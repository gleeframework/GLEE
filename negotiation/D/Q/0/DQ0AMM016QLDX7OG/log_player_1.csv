Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point - it's significantly higher than what the product is worth to him, but still leaves room for negotiation. 

If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter, but I'm also keeping John's offer of $15,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept a price that is significantly less than what it's worth to me. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my previous offer. I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price, but I'm also aware that further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to go lower than $13,000, and I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal completely.  John's offer is a safe and secure option that guarantees me the best possible price."
