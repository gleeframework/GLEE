Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice. She's unlikely to go much lower than $10,500, and you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  You're better off taking the guaranteed savings."
