It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $9,500."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $9200, which is a good compromise. What do you think?

You're still above your preferred price point, but you can probably squeeze out a little more."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9000 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $9100, which is the lowest I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:

At this point, it's probably best to accept Alice's offer. You're already close to your budget, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.  You can save $900 compared to buying from John."
