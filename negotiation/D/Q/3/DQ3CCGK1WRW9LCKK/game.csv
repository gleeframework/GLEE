"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something truly special, and I believe it could be a game-changer for you.  I'm asking for $2000000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the sentiment behind your offer, but based on my current budget and the value I perceive for the product, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. Could we perhaps negotiate closer to the $1200000 mark?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $1200000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000, which takes into account the value you see in the product. This is my final offer.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for considering my position. I understand your perspective, but I must stick to my budget. I am unable to match the price of $1750000. However, I would like to propose a price of $1600000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
