"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, he should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows him to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, but he also wants to avoid completely alienating Alice.  Offering $10,500 is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above Alice's minimum value for the product. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to potentially save a considerable amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $11,500 is still above Bob's minimum value of $10,000.  However, it is lower than Bob's initial counteroffer and closer to his target price.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to purchase the product at a price that is still within his budget and saves him $500 compared to buying from John. There's a high chance that further negotiation will only lead to more back-and-forth and a higher risk of Alice rejecting future offers, making this a good opportunity to finalize the deal."
