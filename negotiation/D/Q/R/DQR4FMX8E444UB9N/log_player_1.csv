Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$9,000:** This is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than my minimum price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm trying to build rapport with Bob and make him feel like this is a good deal for him. 

I'm starting with a high offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects it. I'm also aware of John's offer, which gives me a safety net in case the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $8,000. I'm not willing to sell for less than that, and I'm confident that I can do better. 

I'll counter Bob's offer and try to negotiate a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,250.  It's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm offering $8,250 which is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to go too low.
* **Positive message:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing fairness to maintain a good rapport with Bob. 
* **Still above minimum:**  $8,250 is above my minimum threshold of $8,000, so it's a win for me if it gets accepted.

I'm hopeful that Bob will accept this counteroffer, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $8250 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $8000?  That's my absolute top limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would have preferred to get a bit more, it's a good outcome considering the negotiation process.  Accepting this offer allows me to finalize the deal and avoid further negotiation rounds.  

It's also important to note that selling to John for $8,000 would be the same outcome, but accepting Bob's offer is slightly preferable as it allows me to potentially build a future relationship with Bob."
