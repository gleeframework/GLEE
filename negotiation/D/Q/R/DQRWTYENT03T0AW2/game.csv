"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $11,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,500. If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $9,500, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,5,
