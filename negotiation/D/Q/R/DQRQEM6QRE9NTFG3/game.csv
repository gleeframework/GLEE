"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but it's more in line with my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1200000 is my minimum,  I'm willing to compromise slightly to reach an agreement. I'm proposing a price of $1350000.  This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints. Let's find common ground and finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
