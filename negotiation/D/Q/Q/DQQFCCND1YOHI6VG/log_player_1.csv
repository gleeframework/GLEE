"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $18,000, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($15,000) but lower than what I know the product is worth to me.  This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation. This encourages Bob to engage in the process. 

I'm confident that this starting offer will initiate a good negotiation. We'll see if Bob is willing to play ball!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000.  While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept a price that's below my floor.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can come to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility while protecting my interests. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my price, emphasizing the value of the product and the need for a fair profit margin.
* **Openness:** I'm still trying to be open to finding a middle ground, encouraging Bob to engage further.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will move us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $13,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $15,000 I'd receive from John. I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum, especially when I have a guaranteed sale from John. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can find a more suitable price in the next rounds. I still have a few rounds to try and negotiate with Bob, and there's always the option of selling to John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $14,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hopeful that we can close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise by lowering my price to $14,000, which is only $1,000 below my minimum. 
* **Urgency:**  I'm suggesting that this is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping to close the deal. This adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Open-ended:** I'm leaving the message open-ended, giving Bob a chance to respond and potentially lead to further negotiation.

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be appealing enough to Bob to close the deal. If not, I still have the option to sell to John, but I'd rather close the deal with Bob if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $14,000, so I'll offer $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is still below my minimum price of $15,000.  While I appreciate his willingness to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than what I'd receive from John.  I've already made several compromises, and we're running out of time.  It's better to secure the guaranteed sale with John than to risk further negotiation with Bob that might not lead to a better outcome."
