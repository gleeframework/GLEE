"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of starting with a price of $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $180 is far above my maximum budget of $80.  It's much better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you offering me this product. However, $180 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product but I can only offer $80 for it right now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum price of $80. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also being upfront about my budget limitations. This hopefully encourages her to consider a significant price reduction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a better offer than $180, it's still above my maximum budget of $80. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $90. This is a fair price, and it's as high as I can go at the moment. I'm really keen on getting this product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $90. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still staying within a reasonable range. By highlighting my interest in the product, I'm hoping to encourage Alice to accept my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll sell it to you for $110. This is my best offer so far, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating for one more round to see if I can get Alice to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're firm on your offer, Alice.  However, $110 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm really pushing my budget to the limit here, but I can offer $100.  If you're serious about selling, this is my absolute final offer."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pushing the Limit:** I'm offering $100, which is only $10 away from my maximum budget of $80. This demonstrates a genuine effort to meet halfway, but also underlines the financial constraints.
* **Final Offer:**  Stating this is my ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and potentially prompts Alice to reconsider.  
* **Genuine Interest:**  Reiterating my interest in the product, especially in light of the limited budget, might appeal to Alice's desire to see a sale through."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're really trying to make this work, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll sell it to you for $130. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still above my maximum budget of $80. I've already made significant concessions, and it's unlikely that I'll be able to get her to go lower. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $80. This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation that might not lead to a successful outcome."
