"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $775,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you, and I'm eager to make this deal work.  How about we split the difference and go with $800,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both walk away happy.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm close to accepting, but I'd like to make one final push for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $785,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's a bit closer to what I'm looking for.",785000.0,Bob,6,
