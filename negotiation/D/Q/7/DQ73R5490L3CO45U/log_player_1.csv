{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a great opportunity for you, and I believe it's worth $1,000,000 to you.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).** This shows you're serious about selling to Bob and leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000).**  This makes it attractive to Bob and increases the likelihood of acceptance. 

Remember, you can adjust the price based on Bob's response and your analysis of his willingness to pay. Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is still above your minimum, it's not a great deal. You can potentially get more by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  

The strategy here is to keep Bob engaged and try to close the gap.  You'll likely have to meet him somewhere in the middle."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $775,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below what you'd ideally like to get.  You're in a good position to continue negotiating.  

* **Counter-Offer:**  You can try to meet Bob halfway by offering something like $800,000.  This shows you're serious about making a deal but also leaves room for a little more give-and-take.

Remember, each negotiation round is a chance to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay and adjust your strategy accordingly.  Good luck!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm eager to make this deal work.  How about we split the difference and go with $800,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to accepting, but I'd like to make one final push for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $785,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's a bit closer to what I'm looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, you've reached a crossroads:

* **Bob's Offer:** $785,000 is closer to your minimum, but it's still below what you'd ideally get.
* **John's Offer:** $800,000 is your minimum, and it's guaranteed. 

Given that you have a guaranteed offer from John for your minimum acceptable price, it's best to take the sure thing. There's always the risk that continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a stalemate or even a lower price.  

It's better to secure the $800,000 now and avoid the potential for disappointment or further haggling."
