,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $180 was my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down to $150. I believe this product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with your purchase.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $135?  This seems like a fair price considering the value this product offers.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $125. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",125.0,Bob,6,
