Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant returns you'll see.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John,  trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below its value to Bob ($1,400,000) creates a strong incentive for him to buy. He gets a $100,000 discount, making it a compelling deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely, starting high leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to an even higher sale price. 

This approach balances risk and reward, aiming to secure the highest possible profit for Alice."
