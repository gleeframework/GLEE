{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident it will be a great asset. My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  I have 9 more rounds to work with, so I'm not going to give up just yet."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away feeling satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000. I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I'm still not going to give in to Bob's low offer.  $1,150,000 is way too far from my desired price. I'm going to hold out for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,150,000 is simply not enough.  Let's try to be realistic here. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,250,000. This is my final offer before I start considering other options."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to be realistic, but $1,250,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm running out of time and Bob's offers are getting increasingly unrealistic.  He's clearly not willing to budge much, and I'm not comfortable accepting such a low price. With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk getting stuck with a bad deal. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,500,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer."
