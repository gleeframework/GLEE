I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your life. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000.

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $725,000. However, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's worth to me is $1,200,000.

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at your maximum budget."
