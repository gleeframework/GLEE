{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident in the product's worth and am willing to negotiate, but I'm also aware of John's offer, which provides a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find it elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $130 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but it's close. I'm going to reject his offer and counter-offer to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm confident I can get a better deal than $130, as I have John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. It's a fair price for a product of this quality, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've done some research and found that I can indeed get a similar product for $125 from another seller. However, I'm still interested in your product and would like to propose $130. This way, we both benefit - you receive a fair price for your item, and I save some money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my desired price, but it's getting closer.  I'm willing to accept his offer for $130. It's a fair price considering my minimum is $150, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely.  While I could continue negotiating,  it's possible Bob might walk away, and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing."
