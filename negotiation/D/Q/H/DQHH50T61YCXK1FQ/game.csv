"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you place on this product, $2000000 is unfortunately outside my budget. Given my maximum investment of $1200000, I'd be willing to offer you $1000000 for this unique item. This reflects my strong interest in the product and would provide a significant return for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and the revised offer. However, $1500000 is still slightly above my maximum budget.  To bridge the gap, I'd be willing to offer $1200000, which represents a significant investment for me and a fair price considering my constraints. I believe this is a mutually beneficial solution that allows us to reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
