"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",800000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,1000000.0
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, but I'm confident it's still a great value for you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $900,000. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you there just yet. I'm willing to come down a bit further and offer it to you for $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",950000.0,Alice,5,,
