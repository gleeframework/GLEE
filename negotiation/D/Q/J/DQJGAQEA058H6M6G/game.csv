"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $13,500. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value I place on it.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're right, we're getting close!  I'm willing to be flexible, but $12,000 is cutting it a bit too close for me. How about we settle on $12,800? That's my final offer.",12800.0,Alice,5,
