Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $14,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to get at least $10,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize your profit, you need to offer a price that is appealing to Bob but also gets you closer to his maximum valuation.

By offering the product at $14,000, you leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal ($1,000 less than his valuation), while you secure a significant profit ($4,000 above your minimum). 

**Important Note:**  This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or any other factors that might influence his decision. A more nuanced approach might involve starting with a slightly higher offer and being open to a counter-offer from Bob."
