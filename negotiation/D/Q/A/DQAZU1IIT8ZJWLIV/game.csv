"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a more reasonable price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $700,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,4,
