"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this product at a discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to acquire this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,320,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to acquire this product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. While it's closer than the initial offer, Bob has already made a counteroffer and rejected Alice's offer. It's worth continuing to negotiate to try and get a lower price. There are still several rounds left, and Bob can always choose to buy from John if he doesn't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to work with me. While your offer is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still just a bit too high. I'm prepared to pay $1,280,000 for the product. This would allow me to acquire it while staying within my budget and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1280000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,280,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. While she is coming down in price, it's still too high for Bob. He has already made several counteroffers and is within 5 rounds of being able to buy from John, who is offering a price that works for him. Continuing to negotiate is a better strategy than accepting Alice's current offer or buying from John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,290,000 for the product. I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, and it allows me to acquire the product while staying within my financial constraints."", ""product_price"": 1290000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,290,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $1,295,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,295,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,295,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. Although she is getting closer, Bob has only 3 rounds left before he can automatically purchase from John. Continuing to negotiate, with the goal of driving the price down, is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While your offer is getting closer to my budget, I'm still unable to go that high. I'm willing to pay $1,275,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to you, and it allows me to acquire it while staying within my financial constraints. I believe it's time for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,275,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $1,285,000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,285,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,285,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has only one round left with Alice. Her offer of $1,285,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's unlikely that Alice will lower her price significantly enough in the final round for Bob to get a better deal. Therefore, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $1,200,000, securing the product at the best possible price for him."
