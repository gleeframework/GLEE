"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Is there any flexibility in your price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000, which is my minimum price. However, I'm willing to offer a slight discount to $1150000 to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000. I think that's a fair price for the product. Can you consider it?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $950000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $1100000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $980000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final compromise, and I can offer you the product for $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, let me know, but if not, I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay the full $1200000.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
