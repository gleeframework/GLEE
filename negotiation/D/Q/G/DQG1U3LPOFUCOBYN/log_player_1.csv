"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its incredible potential, I'm asking for $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming for the highest possible profit.  By starting significantly above both our minimum and Bob's perceived value, we leave room for negotiation while gauging his interest.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and presents the price confidently, without seeming aggressive.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""What do you think?"" invites Bob's response and implies a willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy allows us to gather information about Bob's willingness to pay while keeping the option of a deal with John on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $1,800,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than our initial asking price. We have room to negotiate and try to secure a better deal. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is our fallback option but not ideal at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it falls short of what I had in mind.  The product's value is undeniable, and I'm confident it will bring you a significant return. How about we meet in the middle at $2,100,000?"", 
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're lowering our price, but not drastically. A $200,000 reduction shows flexibility while maintaining a strong position. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  We're reiterating the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential benefits.
* **Compromise Language:**  ""Meet in the middle"" suggests fairness and encourages Bob to make a similar move towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the compromise. I would like to counter with $2,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $2,000,000 is a strong price, exceeding our minimum by a significant margin. While we could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Accepting now secures a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
