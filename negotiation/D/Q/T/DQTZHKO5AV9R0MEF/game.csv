"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it's worth at least $150 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $125. Let me know what you think!",125.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $125 is a bit above my budget. I'd be happy to pay $105. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $105, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to pay $115 for the product? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with it.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your asking price, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $110. This is my final offer, as I'm happy to go with John if this doesn't work out.",110.0,Bob,4,
