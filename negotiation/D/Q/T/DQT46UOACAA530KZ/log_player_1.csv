{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $15,000 but I want to start a bit lower to give Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.  I'm also leaving the door open to potentially sell to John if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $11,000 is too low for me, even though it's still above my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $11,000 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000}
