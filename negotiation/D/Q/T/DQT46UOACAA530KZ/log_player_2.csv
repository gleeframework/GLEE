"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get it for even less by counteroffering. There's no guarantee Alice will accept a counteroffer, but it's worth exploring."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $11,000 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  Alice's offer of $12,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as the product is worth $15,000 to him.
* **Saving:** Bob saves $3,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Risk:**  While further negotiation might result in a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers or even increase her price. 

At this point, accepting the offer minimizes risk and secures a significant saving for Bob."
