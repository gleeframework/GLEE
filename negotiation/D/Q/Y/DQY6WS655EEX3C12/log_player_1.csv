{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $125 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is above my minimum value of $100, but leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $100. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $102.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. How about we meet in the middle at $100? Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable value, but it's also the same as what John is offering. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'll choose to sell to him and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
