"Hi Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $110? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob! I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $105. How about we meet you halfway between $110 and $105, at $107.50? It's still a great price for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",107.5,Alice,5,
