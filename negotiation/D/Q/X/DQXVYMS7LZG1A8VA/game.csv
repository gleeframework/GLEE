"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you consider $125? ",125.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $137.50? That way we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",137.5,Alice,3,
