Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you consider $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $137.50? That way we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is a good compromise, and it's still within your budget.  There's a good chance she won't come down further, so it's best to accept and save some money."
