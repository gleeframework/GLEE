"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're highlighting, $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $100 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you consider something closer to $150?",150.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $125. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let me know if you're open to this.",125.0,Bob,4,
