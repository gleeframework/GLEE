"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you this unique product that I know you'll find extremely valuable.  I'm confident it will be worth more than $1 million to you. To make this deal even sweeter, I'm willing to let it go for a price that's more than fair for both of us. Let's discuss a price that works for both of us - I'm sure we can find a solution that benefits everyone. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'm interested in the product, but I'm not sure if Alice's offer is the best deal for me. Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I'm thinking that she might be willing to negotiate further. I'd like to reject her initial offer and see if we can come to a better agreement.
