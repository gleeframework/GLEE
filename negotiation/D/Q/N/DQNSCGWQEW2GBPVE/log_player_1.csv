Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product of exceptional value. While I can't disclose the exact details at this stage, I assure you it's worth at least $1,000,000 to me. My initial offer is $1,500,000.  Consider this a chance to invest in something truly remarkable.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial offer is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, I believe I can get closer to my desired value. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I value your perspective, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1400000 is not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1300000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,300,000 is a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  It's important to remember that we only have 10 rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
