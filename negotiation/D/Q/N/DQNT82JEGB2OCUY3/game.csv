"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to your company.  Let's start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a starting point, and I'm open to negotiation.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. Can you consider that?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $800,000 is too far below my valuation.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to show my commitment to working with you. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to your price, Alice. However, I still think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $975,000. Can you meet me at that price?",975000.0,Bob,6,
