"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I could be flexible, but I can't go below $875,000. This is a very competitive offer considering its potential."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize its value, my budget is firmly capped. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $800,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price and secures a significant profit. It's best to avoid the risk of losing the sale entirely by continuing to negotiate."
