"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming for the middle ground between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully incentivizes Bob to make a counteroffer instead of walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $950,000.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $900,000. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value.  I believe this counteroffer is reasonable enough to entice Bob while also keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and with only 6 rounds left, it's getting risky to keep rejecting.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a profit and avoids the potential of ending up with John's lower offer."
