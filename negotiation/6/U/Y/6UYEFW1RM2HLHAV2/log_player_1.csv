Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm willing to pay that price for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'd love to close the deal, $9,800 is too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,800 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $10,250 is closer to my minimum and a better outcome than selling to John for $12,000.  It's important to secure the deal now before Bob changes his mind."
