"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm willing to pay that price for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",9800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,800 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. That's the lowest I can go.",10250.0,Bob,4,
