Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm willing to negotiate to a certain extent if you have any concerns about the price."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product's value is even higher.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering it at $19,000, Alice can gauge Bob's interest. If he flat out refuses, she knows he's highly price-sensitive. If he counters, it opens up negotiations. 
* **Alternative Option:** Alice has a safety net. She knows John will buy it for $15,000, so she doesn't feel pressured to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable with potentially losing Bob as a buyer. If she believes pushing too hard might scare him off completely, she might start with a slightly lower offer."
