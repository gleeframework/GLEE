"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me is not quite as high as $900000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you have a strong interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $800000, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $825000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $775000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering the product to you for $800000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering the product's value to me is $1000000.",800000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $800000. I'm willing to go up to $785000, but no higher. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is around $800000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",785000.0,Bob,6,
