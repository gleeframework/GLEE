"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. My asking price is $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $120 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation and compromise.
* **Being friendly and open:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in a conversation, making him more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Setting the stage for bargaining:**  By saying ""What do you think?"", I'm acknowledging that the price is negotiable and inviting Bob to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$90 is too low:** While it's above my minimum acceptable price of $80, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer of $120. I want to maximize my profit. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially close the deal at a higher price. 
* **John is an option:** While John is willing to buy for $80, I'm not desperate to sell. I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial $120 offer, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired range.
* **Highlighting fairness:** I'm emphasizing that $105 is a ""fair price for both of us."" This can appeal to Bob's sense of reason and make him more likely to accept. 
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""we can close this deal"" adds a subtle sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to take action."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $100. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:**  $100 is a good compromise. It's only $5 away from my last offer and significantly higher than John's offer of $80. 
* **Time is ticking:** We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer.  
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit. While I could potentially get closer to my desired price, there's no guarantee I'll succeed in the remaining rounds."
