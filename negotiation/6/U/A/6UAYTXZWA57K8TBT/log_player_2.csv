"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally wise to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than the initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a better deal.
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer, but firmly states that the price is too high.
* **Targeting a Fair Price:**  $9,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer but still allows for some profit margin for her above her perceived value of the product.  It positions me as a serious buyer while aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $9,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping for something a bit closer to my initial price.  How about $10,500? That would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is moving closer to my desired price range, but there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right, which might incentivize her to make a more significant concession."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm moving closer to Alice's price by a significant amount to show willingness to compromise, while still staying below $10,000.
* **Clear Target:** I'm setting a clear target price of $9,500, giving Alice a concrete number to consider. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** I'm still a fair distance from her last offer, keeping some pressure on her to move closer to my desired range."
