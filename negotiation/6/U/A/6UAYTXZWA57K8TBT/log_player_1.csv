Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of $15,000. This gives him room to negotiate and makes him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the benefits to Bob.  I use phrases like ""great deal"" and ""worth every penny"" to create a positive impression.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm explicitly stating that I'm open to negotiation by saying ""Let me know what you think!"" This shows that I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement. 

This strategy aims to achieve the following:

* **Maximize Potential Earnings:**  Starting high gives me the opportunity to earn closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Keep Bob Engaged:**  By being open to negotiation, I keep Bob engaged in the process and make him more likely to make a counteroffer.
* **Avoid the ""John"" Option:**  By making a reasonable offer, I aim to avoid having to sell to John at the lower price of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is higher than my minimum of $8,000,  I'm not willing to settle for that price just yet.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my initial offer of $12,000.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain Leverage:** Rejecting the offer shows that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a price I'm happy with. This helps me maintain leverage in the negotiation.
* **Explore Counteroffers:** I want to see if I can get Bob to come closer to my initial offer or if I can find a compromise that works for both of us. 
* **Avoid a Premature Decision:**  Selling to John for $8,000 is a viable option, but I want to exhaust the negotiation with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $9,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping for something a bit closer to my initial price.  How about $10,500? That would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer with Justification:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's closer to my initial offer, but still lower than what I originally wanted. I'm also providing a justification for the counteroffer, highlighting the fairness for both parties and the possibility of closing the deal.
* **Keep the Negotiation Moving:** By offering a specific counteroffer, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about reaching an agreement and that I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's first counteroffer, I've shown that I'm not desperate to sell, which keeps some leverage in my hands.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Bridge the Gap:** It moves the negotiation closer to a potential compromise.
* **Keep Bob Engaged:** It makes Bob feel like the negotiation is progressing and that his counteroffers are being considered.
* **Maximize My Potential Earnings:**  By counteroffering at $10,500, I'm aiming to get a price that's closer to my desired target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum and still significantly higher than selling to John.  

Here's why I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer:

* **Significant Gain:**  $9,500 is a substantial profit compared to my minimum of $8,000. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  If I keep rejecting offers, I risk reaching a stalemate where Bob walks away, and I'm forced to sell to John at a lower price.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  By establishing a positive relationship with Bob, there's a possibility of future deals where I can potentially earn a higher price.

Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice to maximize my immediate earnings while minimizing the risk of a less favorable outcome."
