"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $12500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500.  This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this deal work.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",13000.0,Bob,4,
