Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'd be happy to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can make this work.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,750 is closer to my target price, I'm still hopeful I can get a bit more.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
