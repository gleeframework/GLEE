"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure we can work something out. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it, which is the highest price I'm willing to go. Can you meet me in the middle at $8,000?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This is a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $7,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be closer to my desired price. I'm willing to go down to $8,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $7,625. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm not willing to go any higher than this.",7625.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand we're getting close. I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is my final offer, and it's the best price I can offer.  Let's close this deal.",8000.0,Alice,7,
