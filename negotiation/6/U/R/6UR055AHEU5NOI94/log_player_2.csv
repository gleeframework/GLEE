"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $10,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $8,500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,800. This is still a great deal, considering its worth $10,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget:** Alice's offer of $8,800 is below Bob's maximum willingness to pay of $10,000.
* **The price is reasonable:**  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of further rounds might lead to Alice rejecting further offers or even raising her price. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price. 
* **Time pressure:**  There are only 7 rounds left. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of running out of time and having to buy from John at a higher price."
