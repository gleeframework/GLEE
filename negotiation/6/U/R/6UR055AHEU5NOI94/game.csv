"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $10,000 to you.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $8,500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,800. This is still a great deal, considering its worth $10,000 to you.",8800.0,Alice,3,
