"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Could you consider that?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product. While $90 is tempting, I need to cover my costs. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  This would be a great price for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. How about we meet in the middle again at $93? This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to sell the product while still making a reasonable profit.  I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny.",93.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $93. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $91? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in making a deal.",91.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a little further to $92. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's right in the middle of our last two offers. I'm sure you'll find the product to be a valuable asset, and we can finalize this deal right now.",92.0,Alice,7,
