"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. I believe this product will bring you significant value, and I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $13,000 is still a little more than I'm looking to spend. How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  I understand your perspective, and I'm aiming for a fair deal. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects the value this product brings.",11000.0,Alice,5,
