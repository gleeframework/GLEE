"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to further discussions, but I'm looking to make a decent profit on this deal. Let me know if this is something you're interested in, or if you'd like to make a counteroffer.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This price reflects the value it holds for me and leaves room for you to make a profit. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. This is still a good chunk of change, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm open to further discussions, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This price is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
