"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to further discussions, but I'm looking to make a decent profit on this deal. Let me know if this is something you're interested in, or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price point, but it's still worth exploring a counteroffer. There's room for negotiation, and you might be able to get the price down closer to your target."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. This is still a good chunk of change, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm open to further discussions, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this. Let me know what you think.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your target, it's still above your maximum. You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. You have some room to counteroffer again, and Alice seems willing to compromise."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While there's a chance you could negotiate her down further, it's risky.  You've already made multiple counteroffers and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but it's unclear if she'll budge any more.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, it's the safest and most financially beneficial choice."
