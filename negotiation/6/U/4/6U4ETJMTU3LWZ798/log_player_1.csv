Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I mention the product's value to make Bob more interested.
* **Open ended question:** I ask an open ended question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation. 

This approach aims to secure a good price while keeping the negotiation open and engaging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $90 for it. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:**  $90 is only $10 below my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **No need to risk further negotiation:**  There's a chance I could get a slightly higher price, but there's also a risk of Bob walking away entirely or lowering his offer even further. 
* **Time is valuable:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the potential of a drawn-out negotiation that might not yield a significantly better outcome."
