Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. Given my research and the market value, I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its potential while still allowing me a reasonable profit margin. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm confident in the product's value at $1,000,000, I understand your perspective.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While I understand the value of the product, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. To find a mutually beneficial price, I'd like to offer $900,000.  This price is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it reflects the fair market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer, but Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product. We have room to negotiate and time before John's offer becomes the more appealing option."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $930,000. I believe this price fairly reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your ongoing willingness to negotiate.  However, $930,000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm confident we can find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm offering $910,000 for the product.  This price reflects a significant discount from your initial offer and a fair valuation of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, accepting $910,000 is a strategic move at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield smaller and smaller increases. Bob is clearly set on a price point in this range.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate capital.  The longer the negotiation drags on, the less attractive any offer becomes compared to John's guaranteed $1,000,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob could walk away entirely if we push further. Accepting secures a substantial profit, even if it falls short of the initial target."
