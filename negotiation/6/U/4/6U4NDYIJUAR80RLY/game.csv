,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 simply doesn't work for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position.  To show my commitment to making this deal work, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession from my last offer.  It's a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and your budget.  Let's find a way to finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're placing on it.",980000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to the value I place on this product.  How about $1,000,000?  This would be a fair compromise, allowing me to sell the product while still ensuring you get a valuable asset.  Let's close this deal and move forward!",1000000.0,Alice,7,
