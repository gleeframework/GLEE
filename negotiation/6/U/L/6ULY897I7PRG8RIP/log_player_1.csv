"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, but I want to establish a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm happy Bob's offer meets my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for the bare minimum. I believe there's room for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for some profit. I'm hoping this is enticing enough for Bob, but I'm also leaving myself some room to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my desired price. While I would prefer to get closer to $1,750,000, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  $1,600,000 is a good profit and I don't want to keep going back and forth. I'll accept Bob's offer."
