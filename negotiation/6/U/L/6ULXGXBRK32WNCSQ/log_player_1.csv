"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation but still securing a good profit. This also gives me some room to potentially lower the price if needed in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my ideal price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is my final price. It's a fair compromise, and I believe you'll still get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, demonstrating flexibility, but still aiming for a good profit. This also keeps the deal within reach for Bob, making it more likely for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is only slightly better than selling to John, I'm still aiming for a better deal. There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can convince Bob to pay a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell the product for $11,500. This is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm taking a slightly more aggressive approach this round, aiming for a price closer to my ideal profit margin. I'm also emphasizing the ""fair price"" aspect, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum price, and I've already rejected his previous counteroffers. With only four rounds left, I don't see any room for further negotiation that would result in a better price. I'm better off selling to John at this point and securing a guaranteed profit."
