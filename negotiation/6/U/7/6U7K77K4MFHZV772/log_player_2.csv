Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* $15,000 is above your budget of $12,000.
* There's no information on Alice's willingness to negotiate, so it's best to start with a rejection and see if she's open to a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price well below my maximum budget. 
* This will test Alice's flexibility and potentially initiate a negotiation. 
* If she rejects this offer, I'll have more information to adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds."
