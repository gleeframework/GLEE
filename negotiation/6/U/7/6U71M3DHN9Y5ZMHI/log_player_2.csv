"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, and he can get the product for $15,000 from John.  There's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $20,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position. However, $14,000 is significantly below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $17,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He can still get the product from John for $15,000, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still outside my price range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}
