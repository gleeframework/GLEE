"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $20,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position. However, $14,000 is significantly below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still outside my price range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,
