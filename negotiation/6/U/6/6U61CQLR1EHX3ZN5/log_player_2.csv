# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. After evaluating your latest offer, we've decided to counter with a price of $1,285,000 for the product.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your desired price:**  $1,285,000 is only $15,000 higher than your last counteroffer.  
* **Further negotiation may be time-consuming:** Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process and potentially lead to a stalemate. 
* **Cost savings:** While you could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal compared to the time investment. 

It's a good idea to accept the offer and secure the product, especially considering the alternative is purchasing from John at a significantly higher price."
