{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly higher than Bob's estimated value. It's a good starting point, and I can adjust my offer based on Bob's response. I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob or, if he isn't interested, I can sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell below that. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 
This counteroffer is still higher than Bob's offer but represents a compromise from my initial offer.  It gives Bob some room to negotiate while still staying above my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer ensures I get the best possible price without risking a negotiation stalemate or a lower price from John."
