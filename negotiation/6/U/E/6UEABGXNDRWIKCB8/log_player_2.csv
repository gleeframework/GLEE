"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum valuation and her own. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it's still above her valuation of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling that you're serious about buying but not willing to overpay. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a lower number, you're aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to your desired price range.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is polite but direct, expressing your interest while clearly stating your counter-offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000,  given your interest in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  While Alice came down in price, $1,300,000 is still above your ideal price point. 
* **Strategic Counter-Offering:** Continuing to negotiate allows you to potentially reach a price closer to your target. You can use her counter-offer as a gauge to gradually increase your bids.
* **John's Price as Leverage:** Remember, your fallback option (John) is offering the product for $1,500,000. You can use this as leverage in your negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? That's a fair offer considering the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):**  This counter-offer aims to show willingness to compromise while still edging closer to your target price.  It's slightly in your favor from the exact middle ground between her last offer ($1,300,000) and your previous one ($1,100,000).
* **Justifying the Price:**  By mentioning ""fair offer"" and ""value of the product,"" you subtly reinforce that your offer isn't arbitrary and is based on a reasonable assessment.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving without conceding too much too quickly."
