"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $12,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $16,000. That's still a good deal for a product of this quality. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,250. That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction.",14250.0,Alice,5,
