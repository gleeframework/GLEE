Bob's offer:

You have three options:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. How about $150? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150.

At this point, Bob's offer matches what John is willing to pay. There's no guarantee of a better outcome with further negotiation, and it's best to avoid potentially losing both offers."
