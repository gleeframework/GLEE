"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $10,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $11,000?  That leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not quite there.  $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $10,500? It's a good compromise, and I think it would make both of us happy.",10500.0,Bob,4,
