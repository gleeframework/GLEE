"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is asking for $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **There are more rounds to go.** You don't need to accept the first offer. By rejecting, you can try to get a lower price.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  If you can't get a better deal from Alice, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $10,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $11,000?  That leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's come down from $12,000, $11,000 is still more than you're comfortable with. 
* **You have more negotiating room.**  You're still $4,000 below your maximum price, and you have more rounds left to try and get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is always an option.** You can still get the product from John if you can't reach an agreement with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not quite there.  $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $10,500? It's a good compromise, and I think it would make both of us happy."", ""product_price"": 10500}
