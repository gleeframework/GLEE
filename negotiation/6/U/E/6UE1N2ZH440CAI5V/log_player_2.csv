"Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product, and Alice's offer is $135. While this is a good deal, you can try to save more money by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $125, which is still more than what the product is worth to Alice ($120), but significantly less than her initial offer of $135. This allows for some room for negotiation while still ensuring a profitable deal for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer is $140, which is still less than the price John is offering ($150). Accepting this offer allows me to save $10 compared to buying from John, and it's a reasonable price considering the product is worth $120 to Alice. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject my counteroffer again, and I might end up paying the full $150 to John."
