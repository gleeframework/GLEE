""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice's goal is to get the highest price possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so Alice needs to offer it below that to entice him.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** Alice has a guaranteed offer from John at $12,000, providing a safety net. 

By offering the product at $11,999, Alice aims for a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation while staying just under her guaranteed offer from John. This leaves room for potential negotiation while ensuring Alice doesn't lose money if Bob rejects the offer."
