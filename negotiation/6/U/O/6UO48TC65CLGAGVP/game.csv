"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I think $11,000 is closer to a fair price, I'm aiming for something under $10,000. How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go and still make a reasonable profit.",10500.0,Alice,5,
