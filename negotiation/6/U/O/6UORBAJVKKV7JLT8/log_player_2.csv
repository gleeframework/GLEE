"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. There's no reason to accept this offer. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price ($20,000) is a good strategy to signal Bob's serious intent to negotiate and get a favorable price.  Offering $10,000 is a substantial discount, but still allows room for negotiation if Alice rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the first round, it's still above Bob's budget. It's worth continuing the negotiation process.  There's still room to negotiate a lower price, and Bob should aim for a price closer to his $15,000 maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget of $15,000. Offering $13,000 is a reasonable counteroffer. It's a significant decrease from Alice's last offer, showing Bob's commitment to getting a better price, but it also leaves room for negotiation if Alice wants to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget, and he's already made significant progress in lowering the price.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to try and reach a price closer to his maximum. The next counteroffer can aim to further close the gap between the current offer and Bob's desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been steadily decreasing the price and is now within striking distance of his maximum budget. Offering $14,000 shows a strong commitment to securing a deal while leaving some wiggle room for Alice to accept.  This counteroffer represents a significant compromise and is a good strategy to potentially close the deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget.  Even though it's a small gap ($1,500), Bob has already lowered the price considerably and should continue to push for a better deal. This counteroffer is a good opportunity to reach a deal within his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final offer. He's reached his maximum budget and is prepared to buy from John if Alice rejects.  This counteroffer is bold and shows a strong commitment to securing a deal.  Hopefully, Alice recognizes the value of the product and is willing to close the deal."
