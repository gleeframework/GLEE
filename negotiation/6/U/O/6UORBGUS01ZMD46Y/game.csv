"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what I'd get from another buyer. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Can you meet me at that price?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $800000? This would be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $800000 is a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $700000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700000 is still a bit too low.  Let's aim for a compromise - how about $900000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway to make this deal happen.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $750000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",750000.0,Bob,6,
