Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for something you'll value at $150. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation:** You have an advantage knowing Bob values the product at $150. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While your minimum is $150, starting higher allows room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Not being overly aggressive:**  A price too close to $150 might make Bob suspicious or feel like there's no real bargain. 
* **Guaranteed sale with John:**  You have a safety net with John, ensuring you'll get at least $150 if Bob declines."
