,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $8,800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. Let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $8,900 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8,950. This price is closer to my valuation, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",8950.0,Alice,5,
