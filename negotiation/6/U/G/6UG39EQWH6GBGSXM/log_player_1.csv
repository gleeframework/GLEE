Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,800 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $8,800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,900. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $8,900 is still below my minimum value of $10,000. I am still willing to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my target. I'm not yet ready to sell to John as I believe there's potential for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $8,900 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8,950. This price is closer to my valuation, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8950}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that we're getting close to a deal. However, $8,950 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go one step further and offer $8,800. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This negotiation has gone on for a while, and Bob is still significantly below my minimum price.  I have already made multiple concessions, and I am not willing to drop my price any further.  I've reached the point where selling to John for $10,000 is the most sensible option.  It ensures I reach my minimum target value and saves me time and further negotiation."
