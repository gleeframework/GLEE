"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get close to my target price of $8,000.  I'll keep John's offer of $8,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is tempting, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I still have a chance to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to negotiate a little more with Bob before selling to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $8,500.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, while still staying above my minimum price of $8,000. I'm hoping this is a good middle ground that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me. While I want to sell for the highest price possible, it's getting risky to keep negotiating.  I'm going to take the safe route and sell to John for $8,000."
