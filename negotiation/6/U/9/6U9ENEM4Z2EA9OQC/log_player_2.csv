"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth buying from Alice at $12,000 since you can get the same product from John for $8,000.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best option to try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a price that's closer to your budget while still leaving room for potential compromise.  It's a reasonable starting point considering Alice is willing to sell for $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above your maximum price. It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice by making another counteroffer before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 9000}
```

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing willingness to negotiate but staying within your budget.  It's a good strategy to see if Alice is willing to meet you halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still a bit higher than what you're comfortable with. It's worth trying to push for a lower price with another counteroffer before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, acknowledging Alice's willingness to come down in price while still pushing for a price closer to your desired range. It's a good tactic to see if Alice will meet you halfway and potentially make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above your budget, and there's no guarantee she'll accept your next counteroffer. You've already made multiple counteroffers and Alice has been firm. It's better to move on and secure the product from John at your desired price."
