"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you.  I'm offering it to you for $11,000.  It's a great deal, as it's worth at least $12,000 to me.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Rejecting her offer opens the door for a better deal, or you can always fall back on John's offer."
