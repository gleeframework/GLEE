Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, he has incentive to negotiate and potentially reach a deal."

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is willing to pay, it is still significantly lower than my desired selling price. I am going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try and secure a higher price."

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still seeking a price closer to my ideal value."

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not enough. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I would have preferred a higher price, Bob seems unwilling to budge further. I'm not willing to continue negotiating for a lower price, and selling to John guarantees me at least my minimum acceptable price."
