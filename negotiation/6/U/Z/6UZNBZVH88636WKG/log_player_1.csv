"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point because it's more than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  Bob knows the product is worth more to him, so he'll likely counteroffer, and we can work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than what I'm hoping to get, but it's still closer to my minimum than John's offer. I'll reject his offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11200} 
```

I'm going to counter with $11,200. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer but still above Bob's counteroffer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not quite there. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round. I'm not yet ready to settle for John's offer, as I believe I can still get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $11,000.  This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I still believe the product is worth more than Bob's offer.  I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not giving up on getting a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not quite there. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round.  I'm not yet ready to settle for John's offer, as I believe I can still get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10700}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $10,700.  We're getting very close to my minimum, and I'm feeling the pressure to make a deal.  But I'm still holding out hope that Bob will come up just a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting too close for comfort. Bob's offer is below my minimum, and I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting his offers, he may walk away altogether.  Selling to John is the best option at this point, as it guarantees me my minimum price."
