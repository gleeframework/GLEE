"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

Reasoning: 

* **Starting Low:** We want to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards while staying well below both Alice's asking price and our maximum budget.
* **Polite & Direct:**  Maintaining a positive tone encourages continued negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $90, we signal that we're serious but also looking for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reasoning:

* **Still Above Budget:**  While Alice moved closer to our price, $102.50 is still above our $100 budget.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests we might be able to secure a price closer to our target. 
* **John as Backup:** We have the safety net of buying from John for $100 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $90 was a bit low. How about $97?  That's a pretty good offer, and I'm ready to buy if you're okay with it."",
""product_price"": 97
}
```

Reasoning:

* **Splitting the Difference:** We are moving closer to Alice's offer while still staying below our $100 limit.
* **Sense of Urgency:** We want Alice to know we are serious and want to close the deal quickly. This might encourage her to accept.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $97, we're aiming for a price point that's attractive to us while potentially still acceptable to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $97 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to go up to $100? That's a fair price for both of us and a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reasoning:

* **At Budget:** Alice's offer matches our maximum budget of $100.
* **No Guarantee of Further Reduction:** There's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and we risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Equal to John's Offer:** Buying from Alice at $100 is the same price as buying from John, so we might as well take Alice's offer."
