,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $90 was a bit low. How about $97?  That's a pretty good offer, and I'm ready to buy if you're okay with it.",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $97 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to go up to $100? That's a fair price for both of us and a good compromise.",100.0,Alice,5,
