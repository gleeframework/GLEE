{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. It also opens the conversation with a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $90 was a bit low. How about $97?  That's a pretty good offer, and I'm ready to buy if you're okay with it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $97 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $97 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to go up to $100? That's a fair price for both of us and a good compromise."", ""product_price"": 100}
