"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While the product is very valuable, I'm willing to adjust my initial offer to find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. That's closer to the range I had in mind, but it's still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, $700,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try to bridge the gap more significantly. How about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see you're firm on the value, so I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.  Hopefully, that shows you I'm serious about making a deal.",750000.0,Bob,6,
