"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a high starting point, but I want to leave room for negotiation and still make a good profit. I'll see how Bob reacts to this offer and adjust my strategy accordingly."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,500 is still a little lower than what I'd like to get for the product. I'm hoping I can negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round. However, if the negotiation continues to go south, I'll be prepared to accept the offer from John, who is willing to pay $8,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $9,800. This is a slight increase from his offer, but it still allows me to make a decent profit. I'm hoping this is a sweet spot where Bob will be willing to close the deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I am getting closer to my floor price of $8,000, $9,300 is still lower than what I'd like to get.  I'm hoping I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round. If not, I'll be prepared to sell to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product. With only 4 rounds left, I need to make sure I can close a deal that's worthwhile. I'll counteroffer with a slightly higher price in the next round, but if he doesn't budge, I'll be prepared to sell to John for $8,000."

{""product_price"": 9200}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $9,200. This is my final offer. I'm willing to go down to my floor price of $8,000, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value of my product and close the deal at $9,200."

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's down to the wire, and Bob's offer of $9,000 is still a bit too low for me, even though I'm approaching my minimum price.  With no room for more negotiation, I'm going to go ahead and sell the product to John for $8,000. It's not the ideal outcome, but it's better than risking getting nothing at all from Bob."
