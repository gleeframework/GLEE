"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a product that's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to oversell the product, claiming it's worth $15,000 to me when I've already established my maximum price is $15,000.  There's room to negotiate here. By rejecting her offer, I signal that I'm not willing to pay that much, potentially leading her to propose a lower price. Even if she doesn't budge, I can always buy from John at my maximum price."
