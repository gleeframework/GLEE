"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I'm looking for, I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for this product.  Let me know if you'd consider that.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1350000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1350000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $1100000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1225000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
