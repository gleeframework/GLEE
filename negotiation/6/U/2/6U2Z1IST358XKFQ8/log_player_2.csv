"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is a great price considering the product's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me.  However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12,500 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is attractive:** $13,500 is lower than John's price of $15,000 and is closer to Bob's ideal price.
* **Negotiation is a balance:** While Bob could continue to try and get a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers or Bob might end up buying from John.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a lower price than John's, minimizing the risk of paying more."
