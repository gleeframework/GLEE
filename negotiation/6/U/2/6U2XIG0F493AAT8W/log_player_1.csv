Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $22,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $14,000 for the product. This represents a significant jump from my previous offer and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $15,000, which is a significant step forward and demonstrates my genuine desire to close this deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this transaction.
