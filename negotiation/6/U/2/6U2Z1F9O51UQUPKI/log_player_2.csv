"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you.  It's worth $12,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $11,500. You're willing to pay up to $12,000, but Alice is happy to sell for $10,000.  There's room to negotiate and get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start that negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm happy to pay $11,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
