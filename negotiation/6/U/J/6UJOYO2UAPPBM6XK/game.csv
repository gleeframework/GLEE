"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $11,000. It's a steal considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great investment. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $10,000. I'm offering you the product for $9,000, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let's try to make this work.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you need to get closer to $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my willingness to make a deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500? It's a fair price, and it shows I'm serious about making this deal work. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,5,
