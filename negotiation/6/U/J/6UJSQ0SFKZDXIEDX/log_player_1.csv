Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but still leaves me with a profit of $600,000.  

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  I want to start high to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential profit.
* **Bob's Value:** I know the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, so I'm offering him a price that is significantly higher than his perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **John as a Backup:** I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price, which gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts my offer, great! I've successfully sold the product.
* If Bob rejects my offer, I'll wait for his counteroffer and assess if it's worth negotiating further. I'm willing to go down in price, but I won't go below my minimum acceptable price.
* If the negotiations with Bob don't lead to a successful sale, I'll move on to John and sell the product to him."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $1,200,000.  While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm aiming for. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:**  Bob's offer shows he's willing to go higher than his initial value. This indicates there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **John as Leverage:** I have John as a backup buyer who's willing to pay my minimum price, which strengthens my position in the negotiation.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** I believe I can get closer to my minimum acceptable price by counteroffering.

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to reach a price that's closer to my desired $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,300,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a profitable price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and willingness to reach a compromise. 
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still aiming to secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable value, while acknowledging Bob's willingness to pay more than his initial assessment. 
* **Avoiding John:** For now, I want to explore if I can reach an agreement with Bob before resorting to selling to John.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this counteroffer, I've successfully negotiated a price closer to my desired range.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or move on to selling to John."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** Bob's latest offer of $1,150,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** It seems further negotiation with Bob might not lead to a price I'm comfortable with.

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed with selling the product to John and close the deal."
