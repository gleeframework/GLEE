"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept this price. This is a strategic move to gauge his interest and potentially start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer in the hopes of pushing the price closer to my desired range. I want to see how much Bob is willing to budge before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price from the previous round, but still keeping it above what I'd be willing to sell to John for. This shows Bob that I'm serious about selling to him, but also that I'm not willing to compromise too much on my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a price that is higher than what I'd be willing to accept from John. I'm hoping that this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not convinced he'll budge any further. The risk of continuing to negotiate is that we might run out of rounds and I'll be forced to sell at a price I'm not happy with.  It's time to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
