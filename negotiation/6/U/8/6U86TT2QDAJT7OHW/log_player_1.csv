Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $8,000 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that's slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 9,500}

This is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, but it's still a decent offer. I'll consider my options:

1. Accept Bob's offer: If I accept, I'll earn $8,500, which is lower than my minimum price. But it's a guaranteed sale, and I don't know if I'll get a better offer from Bob.
2. Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round: I could try to negotiate further with Bob, but he's already made a reasonable offer. I might be able to get a slightly better price, but there's no guarantee.
3. Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000: I know that Jhon is willing to buy the product for $8,000, and it's a guaranteed sale. It's not the highest price I could get, but it's a sure thing.

Considering my options, I'll choose:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
