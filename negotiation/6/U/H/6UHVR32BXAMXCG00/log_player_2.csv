Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value this product offers. However, your initial offer is a significant gap from where I see this deal landing. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,450,000? This demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work while acknowledging the worth of what I'm offering.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and I appreciate your honesty about your budget limitations.  However, I have to be upfront â€“ that price doesn't reflect the true value of what I'm offering. I'm willing to accept $1,300,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  I believe this is a fair deal for both of us, and I hope you'll reconsider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, but her ""bottom line"" is still well above your budget and what John is offering. It's unlikely she'll move much further, and you risk losing out on John's guaranteed offer if you continue negotiating.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the sure thing."
