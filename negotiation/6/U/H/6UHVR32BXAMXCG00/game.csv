"Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this fantastic product to you. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you.  I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000.  Given its potential, I'm confident this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for presenting this product. While I agree it has potential, the initial price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 to start the negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value this product offers. However, your initial offer is a significant gap from where I see this deal landing. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on the value, but that price point is still not feasible for me.  To keep this moving, I could consider $950,000. This offer represents a significant investment on my part and bridges the gap considerably.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,450,000? This demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work while acknowledging the worth of what I'm offering.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, but that number is still too high for my budget. To be frank, my upper limit is closer to $1,000,000. I can offer $1,050,000 as a final push to get this done.  If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I appreciate your honesty about your budget limitations.  However, I have to be upfront â€“ that price doesn't reflect the true value of what I'm offering. I'm willing to accept $1,300,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  I believe this is a fair deal for both of us, and I hope you'll reconsider.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
