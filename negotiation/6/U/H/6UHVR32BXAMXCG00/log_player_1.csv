"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this fantastic product to you. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you.  I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000.  Given its potential, I'm confident this is a fair starting point for our discussion."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and frames the high price as a starting point for a collaborative discussion. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** Offering at $2,000,000 leaves a significant margin even if Bob negotiates down. This ensures I don't get locked into a deal far below John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for presenting this product. While I agree it has potential, the initial price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 to start the negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). This indicates there's room for negotiation. While I could sell to John right now, I'm confident I can secure a better deal from Bob with some strategic counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value this product offers. However, your initial offer is a significant gap from where I see this deal landing. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** While I'm significantly reducing my initial asking price, I'm still aiming high to leave room for further negotiation. The drop signals flexibility but emphasizes the product's value.
* **Anchoring:** By proposing $1,700,000, I'm setting a new anchor point for the negotiation, pulling Bob's expectations upwards from his low initial offer.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** This counteroffer still keeps me well above both my minimum price and John's offer, allowing for flexibility while ensuring a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on the value, but that price point is still not feasible for me.  To keep this moving, I could consider $950,000. This offer represents a significant investment on my part and bridges the gap considerably. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below my $1,500,000 minimum.  I need to signal that I'm serious about the value of the product and encourage him to move closer to a realistic price point. I'm willing to risk losing this deal to potentially get a better offer from Bob, knowing I have John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,450,000? This demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work while acknowledging the worth of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):**  This counteroffer shows a significant concession on my part, moving closer to Bob's range. However, I'm strategically staying slightly above my minimum to allow for some final negotiation.
* **Justification:**  By emphasizing ""meeting in the middle,"" I'm appealing to a sense of fairness and compromise, encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a substantial counteroffer.
* **Time Pressure:**  As we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation rounds,  this offer creates a sense of urgency for Bob to reach a decision. 
* **John Still an Option:** While I'm getting close to my minimum, I'm still open to accepting John's offer if Bob doesn't significantly increase his offer in the next round or two."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, but that number is still too high for my budget. To be frank, my upper limit is closer to $1,000,000. I can offer $1,050,000 as a final push to get this done.  If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical juncture. Bob has given us his ""upper limit"" and a ""final push"" offer. However, it's still below my minimum.  I believe there's a chance he might be bluffing about walking away, especially since he hasn't explicitly said he will choose ""other options"" if this offer is rejected. I need to hold firm and signal I'm willing to walk away to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and I appreciate your honesty about your budget limitations.  However, I have to be upfront â€“ that price doesn't reflect the true value of what I'm offering. I'm willing to accept $1,300,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  I believe this is a fair deal for both of us, and I hope you'll reconsider."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm setting a firm stance with my ""absolute bottom line"" while still leaving some room for Bob to negotiate a bit further. 
* **Justification:** By reiterating the value proposition, I'm reminding Bob why this deal is worthwhile, even at a premium.
* **Creating Urgency:** We're down to the final rounds, and Bob needs to understand the seriousness of my position.  I'm signaling that I'm willing to walk away if necessary. 
* **Balancing Risk:** This offer represents a calculated risk. If Bob walks, I lose out on a potential deal. However, I'm betting on the possibility that he's anchored to this product and will be willing to make one last concession rather than start over with a new supplier."
