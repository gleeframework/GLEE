"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  My initial offer is not my final price, so I'm prepared to negotiate. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:** I'm still above my minimum of $1,500,000 (which I can get from John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:** While Bob's offer is closer, I still have room for negotiation and want to see if I can get closer to my target.
* **Potential for Better Offer:**  There's a chance that Bob may increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's try to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. It's still considerably higher than Bob's offer, but it signals a move towards compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $1,100,000 is still well above Bob's perceived value of $800,000 and closer to my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I continue to remind Bob of the product's value to him,  encouraging him to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still working within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for your product. I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Continues:**  I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore further options in the next round.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** I'm aware that I could potentially sell to John for $1,500,000, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob before resorting to that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,075,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to achieve our goals. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous counteroffer. 
* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.
* **Urgency:** I subtly emphasize that we need to reach an agreement to achieve our goals, implying a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $1,025,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're already in round 6, and Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk of Lower Offer:**  There's a high chance that Bob will continue to lower his offer in the next round, potentially even further below my minimum.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me a significant profit and eliminates the risk of getting a lower offer from Bob. 
* **No More Negotiation Room:**  I've already made several concessions, and there's little room for further compromise."
