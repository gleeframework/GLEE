"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to make a starting offer of $1,200,000 for the product. Let me know if you're interested!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to invest in this product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider $1,050,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant investment for me. I'm confident this product will be valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $950,000, which is $1,000,000. This is my final compromise. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a significant stretch for me.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $975,000, which is $987,500. This is my final compromise. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",987500.0,Alice,7,
