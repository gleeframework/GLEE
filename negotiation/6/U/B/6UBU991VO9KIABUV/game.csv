"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm prepared to pay $850000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I have to consider my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still very interested in the product, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $950000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $1000000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my comfort zone. Let's see if we can make a deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm still very interested in the product, and we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1000000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to offer $975000.  This is a strong offer that demonstrates my commitment to finding common ground.  Let's make this happen!",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $975000. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'm counteroffering at $1025000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle from here.",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm feeling a bit squeezed by the price, but I'm still very interested in the product.  Let's split the difference one more time. I'm willing to offer $975000. This is a strong offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. I'm ready to close this deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",975000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm not willing to go back to $975000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, which was $1025000. I'm counteroffering at $1012500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",1012500.0,Alice,9,
