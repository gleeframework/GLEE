Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80 from the sale.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $90 gives Bob a good deal (saving him $10) while maximizing your profit (earning $10 more than selling to John). 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob and getting the highest possible price."
