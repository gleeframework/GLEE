Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think it's worth at least $150, but I'm willing to let it go for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential counter-offers or gives the impression of value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's worth and offering a ""discount,"" you're providing Bob with a reason to consider your offer seriously.
* **Leaving Room:** While aiming to get closer to $135, you still have the safety net of John who'll buy it for $120. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters!"
