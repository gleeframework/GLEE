Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is significantly lower than the value to Bob ($12,000) but still above my minimum acceptable price ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Leaving Room:** By not asking for the full $12,000, I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation and hopefully avoid Bob immediately rejecting the offer.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I can always walk away and sell to John for $8,000, so there's no risk in starting the negotiation higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Price:** I can still do better than $9,500. While it's closer to my minimum, Bob clearly sees value in the product and is willing to pay more.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to $10,000 or even higher.
* **John is Still an Option:** If the negotiation stalls or I can't get a better price, I can always fall back on selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm only lowering my price by $200, showing that I'm willing to be flexible, but not desperate to sell.
* **Close to Target:** $9,800 is still a strong price for me, close to my initial offer and leaving me a good profit.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer tests Bob's commitment and gauges his willingness to compromise. If he accepts, I get a good deal; if he rejects, we can continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Goal:**  $9,600 is only $200 less than my initial counteroffer and is very close to my desired outcome.  
* **Avoiding Further Delay:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to more back-and-forth, potentially costing me time and potentially losing Bob as a buyer.
* **Better than John's Offer:**  $9,600 is significantly better than selling to John for $8,000. 

This offer represents a good compromise that allows me to maximize my profit while also concluding the negotiation in a timely manner."
