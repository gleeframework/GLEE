,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it still represents a good value for you. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I'm glad to hear that you're open to a compromise. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,200,000. This aligns closely with your original asking price and allows me to stay within my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
