Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it for $150 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob will pay a bit more than his perceived value.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high leaves room for Bob to negotiate (if he's inclined), potentially leading to a price higher than $150. 
* **Slight Discount Psychology:** Offering it slightly below $150 might make Bob feel like he's getting a deal, even though it's above his perceived value."
