"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is too low.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,400,000?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
