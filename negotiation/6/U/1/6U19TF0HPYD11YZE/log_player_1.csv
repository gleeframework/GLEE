Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great deal considering its true value, and I'm confident you'll find it very beneficial. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $1,250,000 is a good starting point. It's below my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. It also sets the stage for a potential counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

* **Starting High:** By starting at $1,250,000, I'm leaving myself room to negotiate down without falling below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm focusing on the product's worth to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message acknowledges the possibility of a counteroffer, keeping the conversation open.

**Important Notes:**

* This is a starting point. I will adjust my strategy depending on Bob's responses and counteroffers.
*  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $1000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1100000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  While it's closer than his initial budget, it's not enough to warrant accepting it at this point.
* **There's room for further negotiation.** I believe I can get a higher price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. This will involve carefully considering my negotiation strategy and Bob's financial constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value your interest, $1,100,000 is still below my minimum price.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer a final counteroffer of $1,200,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end.  Let's find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a $100,000 decrease from my initial offer, acknowledging Bob's budget.
* **Finality:** The message suggests this is a final counteroffer, creating pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize the benefit for both of us, aiming to secure a deal that is fair and beneficial.

**Strategy:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  I'm narrowing the gap between our desired prices, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Setting a Deadline:** The message implies a finality to this counteroffer, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I'm highlighting my willingness to compromise, making the offer seem more attractive.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully assess Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, the negotiation is successful.  If he rejects it, I will have to decide whether to accept his next counteroffer or sell to John for my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, given my current financial situation, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. I would like to make one last counteroffer at $1150000. I hope this proposal will be acceptable and allows us to reach a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  While he has shown willingness to compromise, it's not enough to warrant accepting his offer.
* **Negotiating further is unlikely to yield a better outcome.** I've already compromised significantly, and further concessions would bring me closer to my minimum price, risking a loss.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit.** Selling to John ensures I receive my desired price and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees a secure outcome without any further negotiation risk.
* **Minimizing Loss:** Further negotiation with Bob could potentially lead to a lower price or a prolonged negotiation process, potentially impacting the value of the product.

**Conclusion:**

Given the current situation, selling to John is the best option for maximizing my profit and minimizing risk."
