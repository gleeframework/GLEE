"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity for your business, and I believe it can be a real game-changer.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, which reflects its value and potential.  Let's discuss further and find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $1,200,000 is significantly more than Alice's value of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's a lot of room for negotiation to reach a price that benefits both parties. 
* **Jhon's price is the limit:**  Buying from Jhon is a backup option if the negotiation fails, but it's not the ideal outcome.

**Next steps:**  I will counter with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. Considering its value to you and my maximum budget, I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good starting point for further discussion."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still represents a significant value for your business.  This price reflects the product's unique capabilities and the potential return on your investment. Let's continue working towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's lower than her initial offer, $1,100,000 is still significantly more than her value of $800,000. There's still room for a more mutually beneficial price.
* **Negotiation potential:**  I'm confident we can find a price between $950,000 and $1,100,000 that satisfies both parties.
* **Jhon's price is a last resort:** I want to exhaust all negotiation options before considering buying from Jhon.

**Next steps:**  I will counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my initial proposal of $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that considers both our needs and allows us to make a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate your efforts.  However, $1,025,000 is still a little too low for me. Let's meet halfway between our last offers.  I'm willing to come down to $1,062,500. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  I hope we can come to an agreement in this round. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** $1,062,500 is a good middle ground between my previous offer of $1,025,000 and Alice's offer of $1,100,000.
* **Value still within budget:** The price is still within my maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiations moving forward:** Alice is demonstrating willingness to negotiate, and I want to capitalize on that momentum.

**Next steps:**  I'm happy to accept this offer and move forward with the purchase."
