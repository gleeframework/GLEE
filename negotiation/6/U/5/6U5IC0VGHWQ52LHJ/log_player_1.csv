{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity for your business, and I believe it can be a real game-changer.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, which reflects its value and potential.  Let's discuss further and find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. Considering its value to you and my maximum budget, I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good starting point for further discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still represents a significant value for your business.  This price reflects the product's unique capabilities and the potential return on your investment. Let's continue working towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that considers both our needs and allows us to make a deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,025,000 is getting closer to my goal, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I believe the product is worth more and I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate your efforts.  However, $1,025,000 is still a little too low for me. Let's meet halfway between our last offers.  I'm willing to come down to $1,062,500. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  I hope we can come to an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 1062500}
