"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase my product.  Based on its value and potential, I'm setting the price at $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering what it's worth to me. What do you say?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit.  Let's find a compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $1,550,000? That's a fair price that's closer to my budget, and still allows you a profit. Let's make this happen.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
