"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $900000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can meet my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still above what the product is worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit more for the product. My counteroffer is $925000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what Bob wants to pay.  While it's closer to his initial counteroffer, it's still above his comfort zone.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $900000, which is the same as my initial offer. I'm hoping we can finally meet at a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is back to her initial offer of $900,000, which is still above what Bob wants to pay. Even though there are only five rounds left, Bob shouldn't be rushed into accepting a price that's higher than his ideal. There's still a chance to negotiate a better deal with Alice or even go to John if necessary."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.
