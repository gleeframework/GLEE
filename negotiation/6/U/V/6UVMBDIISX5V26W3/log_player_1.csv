Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, giving me some room to negotiate. I believe this price point is ambitious but not unreasonable, and it will give me a sense of Bob's interest and budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can get more. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and it's clear that Bob is not willing to go any higher.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000 to ensure I get a reasonable price."
