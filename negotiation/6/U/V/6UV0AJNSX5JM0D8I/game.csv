"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great price, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate the value of this product.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $700,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $800,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",800000.0,Alice,3,
