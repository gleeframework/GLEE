"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $650000. This is a competitive price considering the product's unique features and benefits.",650000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $650000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $450000, which reflects the value I see in the product and allows room for negotiation. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",450000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $450000. Considering the product's unique features and benefits, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $550000. This price still reflects the value I believe the product holds, while also showing my willingness to compromise.",550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $550000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $500000 for the product. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value we both see in the product, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's continue this conversation and find a solution that works for both of us.",500000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering a counteroffer of $525000. This price takes into account the value you see in the product and allows us to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",525000.0,Alice,5,
