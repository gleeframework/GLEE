"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,350,000 is fair.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and her starting price is already $1,350,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have a significant buffer to work with, so rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your intention to negotiate. It's still above Alice's value of $800,000, making it a potentially acceptable price for her.
* **Room for compromise:**  There's still space for further negotiations, especially if Alice is serious about selling the product. 
* **Strategic:**  This initial counteroffer allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,175,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** While she's moved closer to your initial counteroffer, $1,175,000 is still a significant amount above your target. 
* **Room for further negotiation:**  There's still room for compromise. You can try a counteroffer closer to your initial offer of $1,000,000, aiming for a price somewhere in the middle.
* **Avoiding John:**  Buying from John at $1,500,000 is still a worse option than continuing to negotiate with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product and your desired selling price. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still staying within your budget. It's a significant increase from your previous offer but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Targeted Middle Ground:** The offer is a midpoint between your previous offer of $1,000,000 and Alice's counteroffer of $1,175,000.  This increases the likelihood that a deal can be struck.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a positive and cooperative tone, demonstrating your commitment to finding a solution that benefits both parties."
