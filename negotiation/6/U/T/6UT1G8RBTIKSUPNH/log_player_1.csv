"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** By starting with an offer significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and even higher than my minimum ($1,000,000), I aim to set a high anchor. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and make subsequent offers seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price provides ample space for negotiation over the 10 rounds.  
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses positive language and emphasizes the product's value to instill confidence and potentially sway Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving room to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its worth to me is capped at $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  It's too early in the negotiation to settle for less than my minimum. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob, especially since he's already willing to pay more than his initial valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price gap between our positions is still quite significant. I've done extensive research and believe this product offers even greater value than you might realize. To move us closer, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from $1,300,000 to $1,200,000 to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  The new price is still substantially above Bob's offer and my minimum, ensuring I don't lose significant ground. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to subtly nudge Bob to reconsider his own valuation. 
* **Seeking Compromise:**  The message emphasizes finding a middle ground, signaling a collaborative approach to the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, considering my budget and the market value. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might:

* **Walk away from the deal:**  He's stated that $1,050,000 is his maximum. 
* **Become less willing to negotiate:**  He's already moved significantly from his initial offer.

Accepting this offer ensures a profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
