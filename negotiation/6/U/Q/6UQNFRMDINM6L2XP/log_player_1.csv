"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is way out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product but I can only offer $80 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would you be willing to pay $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still only able to pay $80.  I understand you want more, but that's my absolute maximum.  If you're not willing to go that low, I'm going to have to look at other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $80 offer.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price acceptable for me. It's more profitable to take the guaranteed $150 from John."
