"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to make this deal work.  This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's see if we can close this.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
