Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you is even greater. I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is significant to you, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I believe there's room for negotiation and I'm confident I can secure a better deal. Selling to John would be a safe option, but I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further. Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I am still working within a specific budget. I would like to counter with a price of $950,000 for the product. This allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my minimum but I still have some room to negotiate, and I'm aiming for a higher price. Selling to John would be a safer choice, but I'm not convinced I've explored all possibilities with Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is simply too low for this product.  Consider it this way: It's worth $1,200,000 to you.  Let's compromise at $1,025,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. I would like to counter with a price of $980,000 for the product. This proposal aims to be fair while respecting my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I've only got 4 rounds left, so I need to push for a better deal.  I can still potentially secure a higher price, and I'm not willing to settle for less, especially when John is still a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $980,000 is still below the value we both know this product holds.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000. This price is fair, and it allows us to finalize this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
