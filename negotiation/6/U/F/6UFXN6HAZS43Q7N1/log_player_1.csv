Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  This is a unique item, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price, we can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""unique value"" of the product, we're subtly justifying the high price without explicitly revealing our bottom line. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is open-ended, inviting Bob to engage in discussion and potentially negotiate the price. This allows us to gauge his interest and adjust our strategy if needed.

The goal is to maximize profit while ensuring the sale. If Bob rejects this initial offer, we can gradually lower the price, knowing we have John as a backup buyer."
