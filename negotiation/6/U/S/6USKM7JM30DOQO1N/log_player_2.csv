"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still possible to get a better deal. By rejecting and making a counteroffer, Bob can potentially save more money.  There's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower price, but it's worth trying to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a great product, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you consider $10,500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $11,200. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,200 is a fair price.  It's closer to Bob's desired price point of $10,500 and still significantly better than buying from John for $12,000.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk Alice will get frustrated and stick to her $11,200 price, or even increase it. It's best to take the deal and save the $800."
