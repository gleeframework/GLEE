This offer starts the negotiation with a price that's below Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate while still allowing you to potentially secure a profit significantly higher than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than your desired profit margin.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to counter with a price closer to your ideal goal, and potentially secure a better deal."
