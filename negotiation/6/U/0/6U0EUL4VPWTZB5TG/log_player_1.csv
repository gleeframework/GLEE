"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth in the market."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and concessions while anchoring Bob's perception of the product's value. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""incredible value"" and ""true worth,"" the message aims to subtly influence Bob's perception of the product's value. 
* **Leaving Room:** While the initial offer is high, it's still within a potentially negotiable range for someone who values the product at $1,000,000, especially if Bob is convinced of its high potential.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:** A strong reaction (even a negative one) indicates strong interest and willingness to negotiate. 
2. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Starting high increases the likelihood of securing a higher final price.
3. **Maintain the Option of John:**  The high starting point keeps the option of selling to John open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a more reasonable price of $1,800,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase from his perceived value, it's still considerably lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and my initial ask. There's ample room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm serious about a higher price while giving me the opportunity to:

* **Understand Bob's Motivation:** His counter-offer suggests he's quite interested. My next counter will aim to gauge how flexible he is on price.
* **Gradually Reduce My Asking Price:** This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate but in a controlled manner, avoiding drastic drops. 

I'm keeping the John option open, but for now, I'm focused on maximizing profit with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, the product's value remains high for me. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this price point reflects a significant concession on my end while still recognizing the product's true worth."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I've reduced my price by $200,000, a significant amount that shows flexibility. However, it keeps me well above both Bob's offer and my minimum. 
* **Reaffirming Value:** I continue to emphasize the product's worth to justify the relatively high price.  
* **Testing Bob's Limit:** This counteroffer helps me understand how much Bob is willing to stretch his budget and how close we are to a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is important to you. I would like to propose a price of $1,950,000. This is a fair compromise considering both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is definitely engaged now, increasing his offer to $1,950,000.  However, I'm still aiming higher. I'm not overly concerned about time pressure (6 rounds left) as Bob's incremental increases show he's willing to negotiate.

My strategy:

* **Continue Gradual Negotiation:**  I'll make another smaller concession to keep the momentum going but hold firm above my $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Observe Bob's Response Pattern:**  I'm looking for signs of his upper limit to gauge how much further I can push. 
* **Keep John as a Backup:** While the negotiations seem promising, John's offer remains my safety net."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground. How about $2,050,000? This demonstrates my willingness to move towards a deal while still reflecting the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I've reduced my price by $50,000, a smaller amount than before, signaling that I'm getting closer to my limit.
* **Encouraging Words:** I'm acknowledging Bob's commitment to the negotiation, creating a more collaborative atmosphere. 
* **""Middle Ground"" Language:**  Framing the offer as a compromise encourages Bob to reciprocate with a similar move.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm subtly reinforcing the value proposition to justify the still-high price.

I'm hoping Bob will interpret this as a strong signal that we're nearing a final decision point. My next move will depend heavily on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I appreciate your efforts to meet us halfway. I would like to counter with a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a fantastic outcome! Bob's offer of $2,000,000 is well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and represents a significant profit.  

Here's why accepting now makes the most sense:

* **Excellent Price:** I've managed to negotiate a 50% increase from Bob's initial offer and a significant premium over my minimum. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing to push for more could backfire. Bob might be at his limit, or the negotiations could stall, leading to a less favorable outcome. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means I have the capital readily available for other opportunities.

While I could theoretically try to squeeze out a bit more, the risk outweighs the potential reward. Accepting Bob's offer secures a substantial profit and a successful negotiation."
