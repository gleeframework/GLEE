Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth at least $10,000, and I know it would be valuable to you.  To make this a quick and easy deal, I'm offering it to you for $14,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have a strong fallback position. This allows you to aim higher with Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Starting with a significantly higher price ($14,000) allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, it opens the door for negotiation. You can then gradually lower the price, moving closer to your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't have significant time constraints and are willing to potentially lose the sale to Bob to aim for a higher profit."
