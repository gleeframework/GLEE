"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $140. It's a steal at this price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. How about $125? I think that's fair for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a significant discount, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  If we can meet in the middle, I'm ready to make a deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  Let's split the difference - how about $132?  I'm confident you'll find this product is worth every penny, and this price gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?",132.0,Alice,5,
