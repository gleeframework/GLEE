"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I recognize the potential value of the product, $18000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. This is my top offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price given my maximum budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to your budget, but still reflects the product's value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and $14000 is closer to where I'm at.  However, I'm still a bit over my budget.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $12000.  This would allow me to purchase the product and remain within my spending limit.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and my original offer of $18000. I'm thinking of a price of $15000. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.
