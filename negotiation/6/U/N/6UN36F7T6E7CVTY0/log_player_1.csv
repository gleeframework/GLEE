Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you consider that?

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is a lot less than I'd like to get, and I think I can get a better deal with some negotiation. I'm not going to sell to John yet, because I believe I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."

Round 3
