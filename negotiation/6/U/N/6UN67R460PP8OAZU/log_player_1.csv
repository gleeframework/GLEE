{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) while ensuring the deal is attractive enough for him to accept. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a slightly higher final price.
* **Alternative Option:** We have a safety net with John's offer of $800,000, ensuring we don't lose out entirely if Bob declines.

By offering the product at $1,100,000, we strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
