"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? It's a fair price that still reflects the value you'll get from the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $14,000. Let's see if we can close this deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $16,500? It's still a good value for you, and it's a bit closer to what I'm looking for.",16500.0,Alice,5,
