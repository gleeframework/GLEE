Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John as Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale at $100 if Bob refuses.

By offering the product at $140, you're aiming for a price that's significantly beneficial to Bob (saving him $10) while still securing a profit of $40 for yourself. This strategy maximizes your potential profit while keeping the offer attractive to Bob."
