Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

This is a starting point, aiming high to see if Bob is truly interested and what his budget might be. I'm hoping to gauge his initial reaction and potentially open up a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but still below my minimum acceptable amount. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's not my ideal price,  it's close enough to my desired value.  It's a better deal than selling to John for $1,500,000 and it's likely I won't get a better offer from Bob.  I'm going to accept his offer."
