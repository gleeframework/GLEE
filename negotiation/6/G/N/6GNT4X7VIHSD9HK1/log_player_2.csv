"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  He's willing to pay up to $15,000, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offering process, potentially saving even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $10,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still potentially get a better price. He's willing to pay $15,000, so there's still some room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer again allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to his target."
