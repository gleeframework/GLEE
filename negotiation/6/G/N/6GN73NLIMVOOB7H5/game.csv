"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to consider a price of $10,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned it offers.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's as high as I can go. I think that's a fair price for the value you're offering.",11500.0,Bob,4,
