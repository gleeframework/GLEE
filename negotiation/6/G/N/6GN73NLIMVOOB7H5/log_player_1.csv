"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to consider a price of $10,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $13,500?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's as high as I can go. I think that's a fair price for the value you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving in the right direction, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a result significantly better than John's offer. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $12,000."
