"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a good price we both agree on.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but I'm still not comfortable with $92.  Would you be willing to come down to $88?  That's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $88. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $92 and $88, which would be $90. I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to accept it.",90.0,Alice,5,
