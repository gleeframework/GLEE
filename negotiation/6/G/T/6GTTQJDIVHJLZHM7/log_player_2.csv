You can do better than $100, so reject the offer and counteroffer Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.

You have three options:

You're still better off buying from John for $80 than accepting Alice's offer of $92. Reject the offer and counteroffer Alice again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $88. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $92 and $88, which would be $90. I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to accept it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

You're still better off going with John at $80. Alice's offer of $90 is higher than your target of $80."
