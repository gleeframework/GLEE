Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to part with it for the right price. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. It's a steal! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a high price ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially maximize my profits.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the product's value to me, implying that it's likely worth even more to Bob if he finds it appealing.
* **""Steal"" Language:** The ""steal"" phrase is meant to entice Bob and make him feel like he's getting a good deal, even if it's not a true reflection of the actual value to him.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I clearly state that I'm open to negotiation, signaling flexibility.

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point.  The actual price I would choose depends on factors like the perceived value of the product and my confidence in securing a higher offer from Bob.  I will need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's reactions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my absolute minimum acceptable price. 
* **No room for negotiation:**  There's no point in rejecting his offer and going through further negotiations. Even if I counteroffer, there's a good chance he'll reject it, leaving me with only the option to sell to John at the same price.
* **Time is money:**  Accepting his offer now allows me to secure the deal quickly and avoid the risk of losing time in protracted negotiations.

**Conclusion:** While I'd ideally like to get more, Bob's offer meets my financial needs. It's best to accept his offer and move on."
