Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $91? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're close, Bob. I can see you really want this product. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $90.50? It's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while.
