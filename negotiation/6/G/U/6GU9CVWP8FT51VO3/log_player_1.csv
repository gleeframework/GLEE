Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I still believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. Let me propose $1,250,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

While I could push for more, accepting $1,250,000 is a strong outcome. It exceeds my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
