Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its unique qualities. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $10,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, you can start high.  
* **Room for negotiation:** The $19,000 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still getting you a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique qualities,"" you subtly imply the product might be worth even more than Bob initially thinks, justifying the high price.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters, but don't go below $15,000 as you have a guaranteed sale at that price."
