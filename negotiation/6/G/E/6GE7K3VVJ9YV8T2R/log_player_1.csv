"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation but still reflects the product's value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm confident that I can get a better price through further negotiation. I'm still within the first few rounds, and there's plenty of room to maneuver."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's current offer.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still being within a range that's profitable for me."
