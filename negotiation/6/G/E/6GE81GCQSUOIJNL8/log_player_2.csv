"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within his budget, it's still higher than Alice's minimum selling price. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $13,000, which is halfway between Alice's minimum selling price of $12,000 and his own maximum budget of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, showing willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is closer to Bob's desired price and still within his budget. It's a good deal for Bob, allowing him to save $1,500 compared to buying from John.  There's always a chance he could negotiate further, but the risk of Alice walking away and him having to buy from John at a higher price is not worth it."
