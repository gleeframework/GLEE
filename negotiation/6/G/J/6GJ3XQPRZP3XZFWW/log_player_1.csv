Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $9,500 is significantly more than your minimum of $8,000, giving you room to potentially negotiate higher.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so he has incentive to negotiate, but the price isn't so high that he'll immediately reject it. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the value I believe the product has.  I'll try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still want to get a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $8,750 is a fair compromise. It's higher than selling to John, and the negotiation seems to be stalling. It's time to secure the sale."
