"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far more than his maximum budget of $8,000. He has room to negotiate a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  However, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you given your own valuation.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8,000, as that's below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,000 is better than $18,000, it's still outside his budget.  He should continue negotiating to try and get the price closer to his desired $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still beyond what I can afford. Let's split the difference and I'll pay $10,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is still a bit below my minimum price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $11,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than previous offers, $11,500 is still more than his budget. He should continue to negotiate, as he has more rounds available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is a fair compromise considering we're both trying to find a price that works for us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'll offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice is clearly unwilling to go much lower than $11,000, and Bob's maximum budget is $8,000.  Since he can buy the product from John for exactly his budget, it makes more sense to stop negotiating with Alice and go with the sure thing."
