{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a relatively high price, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a positive tone, making it more likely Bob will engage in the discussion. If he rejects this offer, I can then use his counteroffer to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get a higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price.  Would you be willing to pay $9,000?  I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8500. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is closer to my desired price than my minimum. While I could potentially counter again, there's no guarantee he'll accept.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to selling to John for my minimum."
