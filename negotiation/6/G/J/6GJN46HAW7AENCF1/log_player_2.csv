# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs and expectations. This product is not just an item; it's a solution tailored to enhance your experience. Given its value to you, we believe it's worth every penny of the $12,000 we're asking for. We're confident it will exceed your expectations and provide significant benefits. Let's make this investment worthwhile for both of us. If you're interested, please let me know so we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product at her own maximum value ($12,000). You can get the same product from John for the same price. There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer since you can achieve your goal (buying the product for no more than $12,000) with John."
