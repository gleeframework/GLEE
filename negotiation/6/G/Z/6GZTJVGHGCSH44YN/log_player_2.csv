"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  Bob's maximum is $1,200,000, and Alice is asking for $1,100,000. This leaves little room for negotiation and potentially puts Bob at risk of exceeding his budget.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  There's room for negotiation as the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice. 
* **Exploring alternatives:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore counteroffers and potentially secure a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000 for the product. This price reflects the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for us to negotiate further. Let's work together to find a price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,050,000 is a good starting point, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,080,000.  This offer still allows me to achieve a good return, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential value to your company. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** Although Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's ideal price range. Bob is aiming to pay as close to $1,000,000 as possible. 
* **More negotiation room:** There's still room for further negotiation, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise. 
* **Maintain leverage:** Rejecting the offer keeps Bob in a strong negotiating position, allowing him to potentially secure a better price in subsequent rounds."
