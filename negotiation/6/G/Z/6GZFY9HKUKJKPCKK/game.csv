"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This price is a good deal for both of us, allowing you to make a substantial profit while I still receive a significant return on my investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your position.  However, $900,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  This would still allow you a healthy profit margin, and it's a significant step closer to my asking price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $975,000. This is a good compromise that lets us both make a decent deal. What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $962,500. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",962500.0,Bob,6,
