"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to discuss."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a high but not outrageous price establishes a strong position.  It leaves room for negotiation while signaling that you understand the product's worth.
* **Anchoring:** This high initial price acts as an anchor. Even if Bob rejects it, his counteroffers might be influenced upwards by this starting point.
* **Justification:**  While brief, the message hints at the product's ""unique value"" to justify the high price without revealing specific details that could weaken your position. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open to discussion, making Bob more likely to engage in a counteroffer rather than walking away.

By starting high, Alice aims to maximize her potential profit while leaving room to negotiate down towards a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer. However, that price is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below both your minimum and John's guaranteed offer. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open and allows you to guide the price upwards."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product is significantly higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** Dropping $300,000 demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but the new price remains firmly above both your minimum and Bob's offer.
* **Reiterating Value:**  Re-emphasizing the product's high value aims to shift Bob's perception and justify the still-high price.
* **Guiding the Negotiation:** This counteroffer aims to steer the negotiation towards a price point where you can still make a substantial profit, ideally closer to $1,800,000 or higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product holds value, but $2,000,000 is still significantly outside my budget. I can offer you $1,250,000. This is a strong offer, reflecting my genuine interest while acknowledging the limitations of my resources. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, indicating willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still too far from your minimum acceptable price and the guaranteed offer from John. Rejecting shows you're firm but open to a more reasonable counteroffer. You are aiming to reach at least $1,700,000 to make continuing the negotiation with Bob worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To find a compromise, I'm willing to accept $1,850,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to see this deal closed. However, this is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This offer signals a willingness to compromise but establishes a clear bottom line. By stating it's your ""final offer,"" you increase the pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Justification:**  Framing the price reduction as a significant concession on your part aims to make Bob view it as a favorable outcome. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** The price is still significantly above Bob's last offer but allows room for him to counter with a price closer to your $1,700,000 target. 

By setting a firm limit, you force Bob to make a decision while keeping the option to sell to John if he refuses."
