"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let it go for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a better price than John's offer, you can potentially get the product for even cheaper.  By rejecting, you can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to let it go for $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not sure I can go as low as $85, but I can meet you in the middle. How about $92.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$92.5 is still a decent price, but you're still within your budget and can potentially get it lower. You're also within your comfort zone of negotiation, so there's room to try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant at that price.  How about $90?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to buy at that point."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet at a price that's acceptable to me. I can do $95, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is still a bit more than your initial target, it's still a good deal compared to John's offer.  You've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and Alice is firm on her price. It's likely that further negotiation will be unproductive, and you risk losing the product entirely. Accepting the offer allows you to purchase the product within your budget."
