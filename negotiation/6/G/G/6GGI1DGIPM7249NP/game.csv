"I'm willing to meet you halfway from $85, but I'm still not willing to go up to $90. How about $87.50?",87.5,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand your position, but $87.50 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $88.50? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",88.5,Alice,5,,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $86 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal at $87.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally put this negotiation to rest.",87.0,Alice,7,,
