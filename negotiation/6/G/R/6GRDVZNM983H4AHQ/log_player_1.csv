Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and still offers Bob a good deal, given the product's value to him is $15,000. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  Starting high gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Encourage negotiation:**  A reasonable offer encourages Bob to engage in a negotiation rather than immediately rejecting.
* **Maintain leverage:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $8,000 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is a decent price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I can still try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm showing Bob that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Explore a higher price:**  I have the opportunity to counteroffer at a price closer to my target.
* **Assess Bob's negotiation strategy:** By seeing how much Bob is willing to move, I can gauge how serious he is about acquiring the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $12,000, showing flexibility while still aiming for a profitable outcome. 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Signal a willingness to negotiate:**  By lowering my price, I demonstrate a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Maintain a comfortable margin:**  $11,000 still offers a significant profit compared to my minimum value of $8,000.
* **Explore Bob's final position:**  This counteroffer allows me to gauge how close we are to a deal and whether Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired $11,000, Bob's offer of $9,500 is still a good deal. It's above my minimum value of $8,000, and further negotiation may not yield a significantly higher price.  

Accepting this offer allows me to:

* **Secure a profitable sale:** $9,500 is a reasonable profit margin for me.
* **Avoid the risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to bargain could lead to a stalemate or Bob backing out altogether.
* **Maximize potential profit:**  Selling to John for $8,000 would result in a lower profit."
