"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget. There's no immediate reason to accept. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, giving myself some room for bargaining. It also demonstrates my interest in the product and shows that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I can meet you halfway at $137.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial price and still within my budget. I'm happy to accept it, as further negotiation might not yield a better outcome and could risk losing the product altogether."
