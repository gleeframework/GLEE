Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a fair starting point, as it's above my minimum price but still potentially attractive to Bob, given he values the product at $100.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. While it's tempting to sell quickly,  $90 is below my minimum value for the product. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering $105.  This is a compromise that's still above my minimum price, but closer to Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows my willingness to negotiate while also ensuring I don't sell the product for less than it's worth to me."
