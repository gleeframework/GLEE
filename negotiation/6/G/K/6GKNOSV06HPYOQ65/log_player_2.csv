"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** You are willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is asking for $14,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation:**  Since you have a higher ceiling, you can likely negotiate a better price.
* **John's offer is a backup:**  You have a fallback option with John, so you don't need to accept Alice's first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet in the middle:**  I'm offering a price halfway between Alice's offer of $14,000 and my limit of $15,000.
* **Still a good deal for me:**  I'm saving $1,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:** If Alice rejects this counteroffer, I can still adjust my offer slightly higher without exceeding my limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer, but still too high:**  Alice has lowered her price to $14,500, but it's still $500 above my initial counteroffer and only $500 less than John's offer.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that Alice will accept any further counteroffers, and continuing to negotiate could lead to more back and forth and potentially higher prices.
* **John's offer is a safe option:**  John's offer provides a guaranteed price that's within my budget, so it's a safer bet than risking further negotiation with Alice."
