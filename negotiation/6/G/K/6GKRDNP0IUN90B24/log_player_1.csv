"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's something I know you'll find very valuable. My asking price is $14,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit below what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves me with a profit.  This is a good starting point to see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only afford to pay up to $12,000 for it. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not willing to sell it for less than that. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000 to try and make this work. This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I still believe that $12,000 is a fair price for the product. I would like to stick to this figure if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not budging on his offer, and it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I've already made a concession in the previous round.  It's getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing out completely. Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum, so that's the best option at this point."
