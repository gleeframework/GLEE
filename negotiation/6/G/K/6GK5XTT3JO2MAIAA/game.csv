"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher return. Would you consider $1,100,000? I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm getting closer to that $1,100,000 mark, but it's still a touch high for me. Would you consider $1,075,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're right, we are getting close. I appreciate your movement on the price. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,087,500? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of this product.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
