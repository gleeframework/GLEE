Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm getting closer to that $1,100,000 mark, but it's still a touch high for me. Would you consider $1,075,000? I feel that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting close, but I'm still willing to hold out for a slightly better price since we have rounds to spare and Bob is showing a willingness to move closer to my price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're a tough negotiator!  I understand we're both trying to get a fair deal. How about we settle this right now at $1,080,000?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has signaled this is his final offer, and while it's not the full $1,100,000 I was aiming for, $1,080,000 is a strong price. It's a significant profit above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks him lowering his offer or me missing the deal altogether."
