Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** $19,000 is a significant markup from my minimum, but it's still within a potentially reasonable range for Bob if he values the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests I'm open to discussing the price further, allowing Bob to counter-offer if he finds $19,000 too high."
