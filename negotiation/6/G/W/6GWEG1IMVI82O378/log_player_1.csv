Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Bob's offer is too low, but I'm willing to keep negotiating with him.  I'll see if I can get a better price."

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $800,000?  I believe that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'll counter with a price closer to $900,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position, but $800,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000?  This allows us both to walk away satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
