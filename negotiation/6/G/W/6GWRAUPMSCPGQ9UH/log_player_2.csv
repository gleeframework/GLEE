"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, which is much higher.  I believe this price is fair, considering the value it holds for you.  Please let me know if you're interested. If not, I have another buyer lined up who is happy to pay full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

You can get the same product from John for a lower price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
