Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

This offer sets a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It allows for a potential compromise and maximizes the chances of reaching a deal while still securing a profit well above my minimum requirement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll reject his counteroffer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers. It shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not quite there. The risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price, and the certainty of a higher profit with John, make selling to John the better option."
