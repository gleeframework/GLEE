Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is very unlikely to go above $1,300,000.  It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
