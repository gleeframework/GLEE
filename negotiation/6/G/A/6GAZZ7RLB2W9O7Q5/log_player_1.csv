"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $11,500. This is a good starting point because it's a bit more than my minimum price, and it leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer. I'm confident he'll see the value in my product and hopefully be willing to come close to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell at that price just yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $11,000 in hopes of getting Bob closer to my desired price. It's still above my minimum, but shows I'm willing to be flexible. This should hopefully encourage Bob to come up a bit from his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but it's still below my minimum. I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000 right now.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can push him higher in the next round.  I'm still holding out hope that I can close the deal with Bob for a price closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to try one more time to meet in the middle with Bob.  $10,500 is a compromise that's still above my minimum, but shows I'm willing to be flexible.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  With only four rounds left, I'm worried that we won't reach an agreement. I'd rather not risk going any lower and potentially ending up with nothing. It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John."
