Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with your purchase."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much money as possible. While I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, there's an opportunity to earn an extra $1,500 if Bob accepts.
* **High but Reasonable:** $9,500 is a high price, but it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. It leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a decent deal while still netting me a substantial profit.
* **Confident Tone:**  By expressing confidence in the product's value, I aim to nudge Bob towards accepting the offer."
