Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,190,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, our goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's price ($1,190,000) creates a sense of urgency and a good deal for Bob. It's a price that still yields a significant profit for you.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, allowing for potential further negotiation if needed."
