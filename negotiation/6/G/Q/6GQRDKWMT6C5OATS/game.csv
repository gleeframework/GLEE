"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  $10,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $11,500? It's still a good deal for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $10,500. Would that work for you?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? That's fair for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
