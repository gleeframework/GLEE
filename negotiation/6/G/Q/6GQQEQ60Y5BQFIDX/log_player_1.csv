``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's below your minimum value of $1,200,000 but still leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.  If Bob rejects, you can then either lower the price slightly or choose to sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I am willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still below your minimum value of $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation.  You can try to get closer to your desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to accept $1,125,000.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but I'm not able to go above $1,075,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired value.  At this point, it's more advantageous to sell to John for $1,200,000 and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
