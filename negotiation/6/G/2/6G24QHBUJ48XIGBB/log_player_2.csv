{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 33% discount. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation and potentially allows Bob to secure a better price than going directly to John."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. There's still room for negotiation to try and get an even lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue exploring options and potentially get closer to his target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer, showing he's willing to compromise. This is a strategic move to show Alice he's serious about buying the product, but still trying to get a good deal. It also creates a more moderate gap between their offers, potentially leading to a quicker agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now closer to Bob's target price and represents a significant discount from her initial offer.  While Bob could potentially continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice might further increase her price or that the deal could fall apart entirely.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a reasonable price and avoids the potential for further complications."
