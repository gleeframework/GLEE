"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds to work with, and rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. However, it's not an absurdly low number, showing respect for the product's value.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still some room for Alice to counter without going below your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **Building rapport:** The message is polite and friendly, aiming to maintain a good relationship with Alice while still pushing for a favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it's a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above your maximum budget.  You're close to your limit, but there's still room for further negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, and you can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is my final offer.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This clearly indicates you're serious about this price and ready to walk away if it's not accepted. This adds pressure to Alice to make a decision.
* **Middle ground:**  $1,000,000 is a good compromise, right at your limit, but still potentially attractive to Alice as it's closer to her desired price than your previous offer.
* **Polite yet firm:**  The message is polite while conveying a sense of finality. It avoids being aggressive while still showing your seriousness."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1030000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still $30,000 above your maximum budget. You have only 5 rounds left, and Alice has indicated that this is her ""final counteroffer."" While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of failing to reach an agreement is high.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, it's a safer choice to take that option.  You'll save yourself the potential stress of further negotiations and ensure you get the product within your budget."
