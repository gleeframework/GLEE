"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for it.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it's a great value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1050000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product.  This is my final offer.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1030000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1030000.0,Alice,5,
