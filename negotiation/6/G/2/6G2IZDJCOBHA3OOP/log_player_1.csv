Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but $14000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $14,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting his offers, he might walk away entirely. It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk getting nothing at all."
