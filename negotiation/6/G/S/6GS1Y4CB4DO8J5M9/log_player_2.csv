"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know you'd find extremely valuable.  It's worth at least $1000000 to you, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns.  I'm willing to let it go for $1050000, a price that reflects both its value and my desire to see it in the right hands.  This is a one-time opportunity, so let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
