"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better price elsewhere. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
