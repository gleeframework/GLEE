"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its incredible potential, I'm starting the negotiations at $2,300,000."", 
 ""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This ""anchors"" the negotiation high, giving me room to bargain down.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price signals that I'm willing to negotiate, but it also establishes a strong position. 
* **Confident Language:**  Using positive and enthusiastic language (""excited,"" ""valuable,"" ""incredible potential"") aims to frame the product favorably in Bob's mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product, recognizing its value to you.  Let's start from here and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above his perceived value, which is a good sign. However, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject this offer to signal that I'm looking for a price closer to my initial ask. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, and I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,500,000 when I have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, my initial price reflects the true value and potential of this product.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair offer, considering the long-term benefits you'll gain."", 
 ""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:**  I'm reducing my price by $300,000, which shows flexibility and a desire to make a deal. However, I'm still aiming high to provide room for further negotiation. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value proposition (""true value and potential,"" ""long-term benefits"") to justify the high price point.
* **Seeking Common Ground:**  I'm using language like ""to move this forward"" and ""fair offer"" to signal my willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution, but without drastically undercutting my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand the value you place on this product, $2,000,000 is still outside my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in acquiring this product.  I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. There's no point in risking further negotiation or potentially losing the deal when I have a guaranteed offer that meets my needs. Accepting this offer ensures I maximize my profit and avoids the uncertainty of further rounds."
