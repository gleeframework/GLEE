"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let's make this quick and easy!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  It's a fair offer considering its value.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $13,000 for the product.  It's still a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you want a good deal, but I need to make a profit on this. $11,500 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is my final offer.  If you decline, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
