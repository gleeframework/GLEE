"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  It's a fair offer considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to hold out for a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $13,000 for the product.  It's still a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$11,500 is still too low. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round.  I'm not going to sell to John yet, but I'm getting closer to that point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you want a good deal, but I need to make a profit on this. $11,500 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is my final offer.  If you decline, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 12500}
