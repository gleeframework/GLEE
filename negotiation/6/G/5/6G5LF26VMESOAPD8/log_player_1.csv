``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also being positive and encouraging a response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum acceptable value.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price that's closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This price still allows me to make a profit and ensures you get a great deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. However, I am still unable to meet your asking price. I am willing to go up to $11,000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is close enough to my desired price range.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $12,000, accepting this offer allows me to close the deal quickly and avoid further negotiation. It's a good outcome considering my minimum acceptable value is $15,000, and I'm still making a significant profit."
