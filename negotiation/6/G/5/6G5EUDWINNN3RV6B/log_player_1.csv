"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with an aggressive offer, aiming for a significant portion of the value Bob places on the product. This is a good starting point to test the waters and see how willing Bob is to negotiate.  I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I can still push for a better price.  I'm not going to sell to John yet. The price gap between my minimum and Bob's offer is still significant enough to continue negotiating.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $1,350,000.  This shows good faith while still pushing for a price closer to my target. If Bob rejects this, I'll be more willing to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still have a few rounds left to try and get a better price. I'm not going to sell to John yet, as I'm still within my target range.  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm offering $1,300,000, which is the same as Bob's last offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still want to maximize my profit. This puts pressure on Bob to either accept or risk losing the deal to John if he rejects the offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer is my minimum price, but I've already reached round 6.  There is a good chance that I won't get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds.  It's better to secure the sale to John now and guarantee a profit."
