Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and positive tone can help encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  I'm providing a reason for my price to make it seem more reasonable.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I've made a profit and the negotiation is over.
* **Bob Rejects:**  I'll analyze Bob's counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer myself.
* **Stalemate:** If negotiation stalls, I have the option to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $13,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still $2,000 away from my goal. 
* **Potential for better deal:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my target price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John guarantees my minimum, I'm willing to take a risk to see if I can secure a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send Bob a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $13,000 is tempting, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $13,500? It's a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the conversation positive to maintain a good relationship with Bob.
* **Justification:** I'm offering a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a higher price and the deal is done.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll need to analyze Bob's next counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make another counteroffer, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my needs. I am willing to pay $13,200 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum, but not quite there:**  While Bob's offer is only $800 away from my minimum, I've already been through a few rounds of negotiation.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a risk that Bob will continue to counteroffer lower, and I might end up with a price that's too low for me.
* **Time and effort:**  I've already invested time and effort into this negotiation.  Selling to John now ensures a guaranteed profit and minimizes the potential for further frustration.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll inform Bob that I've decided to sell the product to another buyer. 
* I'll move forward with the sale to John, guaranteeing a profit of $15,000."
