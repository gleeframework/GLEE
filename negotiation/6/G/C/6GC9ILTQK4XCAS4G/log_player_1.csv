This offer gives Bob a significant discount from your minimum acceptable price while still leaving you with a healthy profit. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is a more comfortable price for me, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're close, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with the outcome. I believe I can do better and will attempt to negotiate further with Bob."

Bob is clearly not willing to go any higher, and I'm not comfortable selling the product for $950,000.  I'm better off selling to John for $1,500,000."
