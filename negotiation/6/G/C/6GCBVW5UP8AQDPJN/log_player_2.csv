"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I've done my research and believe it's worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her product's value to her ($1,200,000 vs. $1,000,000), but still within your budget. However, there's room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering your asking price and my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $1,150,000, which is still a good deal for me as it's below my maximum budget of $1,500,000. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might refuse further offers and I might end up having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price without taking any unnecessary risks."
