"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering your asking price and my budget. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium to you.
