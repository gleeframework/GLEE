"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,000, which is slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also highlighting the value of the product for Bob in my message to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price that is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,500 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find the product extremely valuable. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,800 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I think I can get a bit more, especially since I'm only a few rounds away from selling to John for $12,000. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and go with $10,150?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,600? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting frustrating.  Bob's offers are consistently below what I'm willing to accept, and we're running out of rounds. It's time to cut my losses and move on. I'll take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
