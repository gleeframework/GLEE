"Bob, I believe this product has the potential to be incredibly valuable for your company. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000, which is a price that reflects its value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is capped at $1,500,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer to my target, it's still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is a price that reflects the significant value this product can bring to your business. Let's find a middle ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,150,000, but I'm still not sure if that's the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is capped at $1,500,000, and I'm trying to be reasonable in our negotiations.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see your point about wanting to be reasonable, and I appreciate your continued interest in this product. However, $1,050,000 is unfortunately below the minimum I can accept to make this deal worth my time. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,100,000. This represents a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for your company.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I can only go up to $1,050,000. I'm trying to be fair, but I also need to make sure this deal is good for my company's bottom line.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
