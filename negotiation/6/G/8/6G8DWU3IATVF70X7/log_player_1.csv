Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have a safety net. Offering the product to Bob at a higher price first allows you to potentially maximize your profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message aims to be enthusiastic and highlight the product's value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously. 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you don't have significant time constraints.  If you need to sell quickly, a lower initial offer might be more practical.
* Bob's willingness to negotiate is unknown. He might outright reject the offer, leading you to John."
