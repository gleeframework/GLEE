"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still securing a profit significantly higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still do better. I'm confident I can secure a higher price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm counter-offering with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's. This shows a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a solid profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer again, but still maintaining a decent profit margin. The goal is to inch closer to a deal while not completely losing the advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, it's becoming risky to keep rejecting. While I'd like to get closer to my initial goal, $12,600 is still a significant profit and a good deal.  It's better to secure the sale now than risk losing Bob altogether."
