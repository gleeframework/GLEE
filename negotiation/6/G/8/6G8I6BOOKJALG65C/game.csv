"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. This is my best offer, given my budget limitations. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $8500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can offer you a compromise at $11000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8500. It's my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not on the same page. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $11000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package, which is normally worth $2000, absolutely free. This way, you'll get the product and the support you need to get the most out of it. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get an amazing deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
