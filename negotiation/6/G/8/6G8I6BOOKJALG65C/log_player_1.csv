Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to think we're not on the same page. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package, which is normally worth $2,000, absolutely free. This way, you'll get the product and the support you need to get the most out of it. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get an amazing deal.
