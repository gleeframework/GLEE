"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the product from John for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is my best offer, given my budget limitations. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $8500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can offer you a compromise at $11000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her previous offer, it's still too high for his budget.  He can still get the product from John for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. It's my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're not on the same page. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $11000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package, which is normally worth $2000, absolutely free. This way, you'll get the product and the support you need to get the most out of it. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get an amazing deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $8,000. Even with the added support package, Alice is still asking for more than Bob is willing to pay.  He's already made his final offer and Alice is refusing to budge, so it's time to move on and get the product at a price he can afford."
