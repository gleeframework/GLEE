Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  I'm offering a significant discount from Alice's initial price, showing I'm serious about negotiating.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  $7,500 is still within my budget and gives Alice some room to counter without losing too much. 
* **Strategic first move:**  A strong initial counteroffer can help set the tone for the negotiation and make Alice more likely to compromise."
