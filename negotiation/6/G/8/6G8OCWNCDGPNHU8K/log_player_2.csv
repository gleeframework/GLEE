"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good deal, Bob knows he has a backup option with John for $12,000. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend closer to $8000, but I still think this product is worth more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this product!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has moved slightly from her initial offer, but Bob is still committed to saving as much money as possible. He has a solid backup with John, so there's no rush to accept.  He can continue negotiating to see if Alice is willing to drop her price further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment. How about $8,500? I think that's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $8200. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle!

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. Bob has been persistent and has shown willingness to negotiate.  While he could keep trying to get a lower price, accepting this offer would still save Bob $3,800 compared to buying from John. This is a good outcome, considering he is still within his budget."
