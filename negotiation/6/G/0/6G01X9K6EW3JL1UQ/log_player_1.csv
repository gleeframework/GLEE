"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play in this range.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I want to see if Bob is willing to go even higher. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm raising the price slightly, to $950,000.  This shows Bob I'm serious about getting a good price, but I'm also demonstrating flexibility. I believe this offer strikes a balance between maximizing my profit and keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $925,000 is a good compromise.  It's higher than John's offer and still leaves me with a solid profit. While I could try for a higher price, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely, especially with limited rounds left. Accepting this offer ensures a good outcome and avoids unnecessary risk."
