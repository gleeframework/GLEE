"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $875,000? This gives you a significant discount and ensures a fair price for me.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but your latest offer is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to be closer to my desired price point.  I'm willing to consider $850,000 as a final offer.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to proceed with another buyer.",850000.0,Alice,5,
