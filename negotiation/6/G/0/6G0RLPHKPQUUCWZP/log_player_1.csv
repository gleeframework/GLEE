Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a steal considering its value to me, and I'm sure you'll find it very beneficial.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price that's close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the product's worth to Bob to make him more inclined to accept. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation by including the phrase ""What do you say?"" 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:** $900,000 is significantly higher than my minimum.
* **Encourage negotiation:**  This sets the stage for a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Keep John as a backup:** I can always sell to John if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum:** While it's closer to my desired price, I can still aim for a better deal.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I'm confident I can get closer to my target by making a counteroffer.
* **John as a safety net:** Having John as an option keeps the pressure on Bob to negotiate seriously. 

I'll aim for a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my initial price, but still higher than Bob's offer. This keeps the negotiations moving while maximizing my potential profit."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $875,000? This gives you a significant discount and ensures a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer.
* **Appeal to fairness:** I'm framing the $875,000 price as a ""split the difference"" solution, implying fairness and a win-win scenario.
* **Maintaining leverage:** This counteroffer keeps me closer to my target price and maintains the pressure on Bob to negotiate further. 

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:**  $875,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's offer.
* **Keep the negotiations moving:**  A counteroffer signals I'm serious about selling to Bob.
* **Maintain a strong position:** I'm still not willing to settle for Bob's first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $825,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.
* **John is a secure alternative:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a much better deal. 
* **No significant room for compromise:** At this point, Bob's offers are getting increasingly less appealing, and there's a high risk that further negotiations will only waste time.

While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for a price that is so far below my minimum. I'm confident that John will provide a more advantageous deal, so I'll proceed with selling to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but your latest offer is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to be closer to my desired price point.  I'm willing to consider $850,000 as a final offer.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to proceed with another buyer."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer is firm in its price but still leaves a slight opening for negotiation. It shows that I'm not willing to go lower than $850,000 but I'm open to a quick agreement.
* **Time Pressure:** The message subtly highlights the time pressure by mentioning ""another buyer."" This is a strategic tactic to incentivize Bob to accept my offer. 
* **Finality:** The ""final offer"" statement strengthens my position and makes it more likely that Bob will either accept or reject, leading to a swift resolution.

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize Profit:**  $850,000 is a good price, closer to my minimum and above Bob's current offer. 
* **Speed Up Negotiations:** This counteroffer aims to bring the negotiations to a decisive conclusion.
* **Control the Outcome:** By putting a final offer on the table, I'm taking control of the situation and increasing my chances of achieving a favorable outcome."
