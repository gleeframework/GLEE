Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm happy to make this offer: $1,100,000. This price reflects the product's worth and ensures a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your minimum:**  You won't sell for less than $1,200,000 because John guarantees that price.
* **Bob's valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Finding a middle ground:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets a $100,000 discount from his perceived value, and you make a $100,000 profit over your guaranteed sale.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob while maximizing your profit."
