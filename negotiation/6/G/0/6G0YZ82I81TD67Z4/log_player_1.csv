"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000). This allows for negotiation room and gives me the best chance to get closer to my desired price.
* **Value proposition:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob.  This encourages him to think about its potential benefits.
* **Open-ended question:**  By asking ""What do you think?"" I invite Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation room:** I still have 9 rounds to negotiate. Rejecting his offer allows me to explore counteroffers and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John:** While $10,000 is a guaranteed sale, I'm not desperate. I believe I can get more from Bob by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This allows for some wiggle room for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I acknowledge Bob's offer while emphasizing that it's too low for me.  ""Meeting in the middle"" conveys a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair price:**  $11,500 is a reasonable compromise.  It's significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial asking price. 
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a positive tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet at $9500? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Time to play hardball:**  I've made concessions already.  Rejecting his offer shows that I'm not desperate to sell for a lower price.
* **Potential for better deal:** With 6 rounds remaining, there's still a chance to get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. Selling to John would be a safe option, but I believe I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $9,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we settle at $10,250? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but fair:**  I'm staying firm on my minimum while making a small concession.  This shows I'm serious about my value but also willing to negotiate.
* **Appealing to logic:**  I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" and highlighting the value of the product. This is more persuasive than just stating my price.
* **Finality:**  The phrasing ""allows us both to come to an agreement"" subtly suggests that this is a reasonable final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit far from where I'd like to be. How about we meet at $9800? That's the closest I can get to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Bob's offer, while close, is still below my minimum of $10,000.  
* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to be strategic.  Selling to John at $10,000 is a safe option, but I'm not giving up on getting a better deal from Bob.
* **Counteroffer as a last chance:**  I'll make one more counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price slightly above my minimum.  If he rejects, I'll likely sell to John.

**Round 7 (Counteroffer to Bob):**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're close to your target price, but I'm still a bit far off from mine. I can come down to $10,100. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10100}
```"

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're close to your target price, but I'm still a bit far off from mine. I can come down to $10,100. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession, but still staying above my minimum of $10,000. 
* **Appealing to fairness:** I'm emphasizing ""fair price"" and ""allows us both to come to an agreement"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Finality:**  This is likely my last counteroffer, so I'm setting a firm price point. If Bob rejects, I'll likely move on to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $9800, and I'll also ask you to throw in some free maintenance and support for the product, which I think is worth at least $200? That way, I'll feel like I'm getting a better deal overall. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is running out:**  I'm down to my last two rounds, and Bob is still pushing for a lower price.
* **Uncertain value:** The ""maintenance and support"" offer is hard to assess. It's unclear if it's genuinely worth $200, and even if it is, it might not be a good trade for me.
* **Guaranteed sale:**  John offers a guaranteed $10,000, which is above my minimum and a safe bet.  It's not ideal, but it's better than risking another rejected counteroffer and potentially ending up with nothing. 

At this point, the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob outweighs the potential reward.  Selling to John ensures a certain profit, while continuing with Bob carries the risk of getting a lower price or no deal at all."
