"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm asking for $15000 for it. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $11500? This allows for some wiggle room for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet at $9500? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $9500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we settle at $10250? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit far from where I'd like to be. How about we meet at $9800? That's the closest I can get to my target price.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're close to your target price, but I'm still a bit far off from mine. I can come down to $10100. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement.",10100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $9800, and I'll also ask you to throw in some free maintenance and support for the product, which I think is worth at least $200? That way, I'll feel like I'm getting a better deal overall.",9800.0,Bob,8,
