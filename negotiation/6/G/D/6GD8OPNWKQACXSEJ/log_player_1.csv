I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters, but it's also a significant profit for me. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth pursuing or if I should cut my losses and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I'd prefer to see if I can get a bit more.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm offering $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it still leaves me with a significant profit. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still a decent profit for me, and it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Rather than risk a further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a stalemate, I'm going to accept his offer."
