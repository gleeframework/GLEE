"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price point you've suggested doesn't reflect the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the long-term benefits this product can bring to your business.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I understand your perspective on the product's value, $2,000,000 is still a significant stretch for my budget.  Let's find a middle ground.
