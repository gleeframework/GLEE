"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the value this product holds. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $900,000 is below what I can accept. How about we settle at $930,000? This reflects the product's worth while still providing you a significant return on your investment.",930000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $930,000 is still a bit above my budget. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $920,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable compromise that benefits both parties.",920000.0,Bob,4,
