Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal and I'm confident it will be valuable for you."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we want to maximize our profit. Offering it just below our guaranteed sale price to John ($12,000) gives us the best chance to get the highest possible price.
* **Creating Urgency:** By presenting a high initial offer, we establish the perceived value of the product. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, this leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly interested, potentially allowing us to secure an even higher price. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation skills or willingness to pay more than his perceived value.  If we had more information about Bob, we might adjust our strategy accordingly."
