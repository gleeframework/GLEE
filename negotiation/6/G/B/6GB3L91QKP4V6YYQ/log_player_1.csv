"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common tactic in negotiation to see how much he is willing to pay. It also sets a high benchmark for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is a decent offer, I'm going to reject it and try to push for a higher price. I can still sell to John for $100, so I have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm making a small counteroffer, increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a better price than $90."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $85 is closer to what I know the product is worth to him, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation and potentially getting a better deal, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway on this one. I've already rejected his offer of $85, and I'm not willing to go lower than $90, especially with the option of selling to John for $100. This should hopefully incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, the negotiation with Bob has stalled, and we are getting closer to the price he values the product at. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further price decreases and the potential for a stalemate increases. 

Since I have a guaranteed sale to John for $100, it's more beneficial to sell to him now. This ensures a quick and secure sale, and I don't have to risk further negotiation with Bob."
