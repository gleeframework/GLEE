"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a high-quality item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Since Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price, accepting is the best option. There's no potential for saving money by negotiating further."
