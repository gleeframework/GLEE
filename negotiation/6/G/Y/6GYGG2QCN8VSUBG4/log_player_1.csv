"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Could we settle around $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $10,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my budget.  To be honest, my absolute top price is $10,750. If you're willing to work with that, we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,750 is still below my ideal price, it's a strong offer and very close to my minimum.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob entirely and being forced to sell to John for a lower price.  It's a good time to close the deal and secure a decent profit."
