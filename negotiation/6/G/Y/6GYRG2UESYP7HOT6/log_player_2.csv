It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since Alice's offer is above your limit, it makes sense to reject and try to get a better deal."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $9,500. This is a good compromise, as it's closer to my maximum price and shows I'm serious about buying from Alice. Hopefully, she'll accept this offer."

Alice is unwilling to come down to a price I'm comfortable with. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John.  While I'd prefer a lower price, $10,000 is still within my budget and ensures I get the product."
