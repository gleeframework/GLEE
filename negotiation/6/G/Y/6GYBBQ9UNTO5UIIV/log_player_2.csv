Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to be compensated for the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and ensures we can both walk away happy with the deal. Let me know what you think.
