Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**The Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob but still nets you a profit beyond John's guaranteed offer.  

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for your specific needs."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Confident:** The message is clear and positions the product as valuable.
* **Price Point:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It gives you a $150,000 buffer over John's offer while still being potentially appealing to Bob. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth, potentially making him more receptive to the price.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher to allow room for negotiation.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you need to close the deal quickly, a slightly lower offer might be strategic.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
