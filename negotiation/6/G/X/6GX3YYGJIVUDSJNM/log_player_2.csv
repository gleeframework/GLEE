"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $90. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $100 to her, so I'm sure she's making a profit, and I'd rather pay the lower price from John.
