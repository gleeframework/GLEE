"Bob, I'm excited to offer you my product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it will be a great addition to your business. I'm willing to let it go for $900,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, but I want to see this product in your hands. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand it's a significant investment, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This price still gives you a good deal while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that work for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go lower than $800,000. This is a significant investment for you, and I believe the product will be worth every penny. Let's see if we can close this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
