Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand it's a significant investment, and I'm willing to be flexible.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.
