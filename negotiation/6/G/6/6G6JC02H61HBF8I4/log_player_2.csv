"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a unique and valuable item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. Would you like to make an offer or accept my price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since you're comfortable paying up to $150 and Alice is offering the product at that price, there's no reason to negotiate further. Accepting the offer is the best choice in this scenario."
