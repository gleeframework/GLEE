"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business.  I'm aware of its potential value to you, and I'm prepared to offer it at a price that is significantly lower than what it's worth.  I'm asking for $1,200,000, a price that provides a substantial savings for you while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. I'm confident that this offer will be mutually beneficial. Please let me know your decision.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
