Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value of $100. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95, which is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price of $100 and Bob's offer of $90.  This shows flexibility while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'll sell the product to him."
