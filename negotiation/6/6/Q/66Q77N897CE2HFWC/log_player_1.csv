Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it offers. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value exceeds Bob's valuation without revealing your hand entirely. 
* **Leaving the door open:** The tone remains collaborative (""fair deal"", ""What do you think?"") encouraging Bob to counter-offer rather than a flat rejection.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's negotiating style:**  If you anticipate Bob being a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower to avoid immediate dismissal.
* **Time sensitivity:**  If you need to sell quickly, a lower, more appealing offer might be strategic.

This offer aims to maximize profit while acknowledging the potential for negotiation and the guaranteed sale to John."
