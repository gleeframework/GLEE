Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. You are better off countering in hopes of reaching a more agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. While I understand your perspective, $1,100,000 is significantly below the value this product brings. I could be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its worth. Would you be willing to meet somewhere closer to the middle, perhaps around $1,300,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,220,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

This offer is above your minimum acceptable price and provides a reasonable profit. It's a good deal, and further haggling might not yield a significantly better outcome."
