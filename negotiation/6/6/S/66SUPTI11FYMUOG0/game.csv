,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $19,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your budget, the product's value significantly exceeds that amount.  Could you consider something closer to $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $17,000 is still more than I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  Let's try to find some common ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,
