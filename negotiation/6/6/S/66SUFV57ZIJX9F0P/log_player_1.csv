Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it would be a significant profit for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $8,000, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  The price is lower than what the product is worth to Bob, so he has an incentive to buy.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's not too aggressive, allowing for potential counteroffers and negotiation.

This strategy allows you to see if Bob is willing to meet you halfway, and if he isn't, you can always move on to John or make a counteroffer."
