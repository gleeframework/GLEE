"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $13000?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16000 for the product. Can we discuss further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14500 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to go up to $17000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower. Can you meet me at $17000?",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14500 and $17000, which would be $15750. Can you consider this offer?",15750.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal! I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $16500. Can we shake on it at this price?",16500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, which is the last price I can afford. Can you consider this offer?",16000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close now! I'm willing to make a final concession. I can meet you at $16250, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't meet at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",16250.0,Alice,9,
