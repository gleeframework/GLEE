"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  I'm prepared to pay $75 for the product. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82. It's a fair compromise, considering its value to you.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit.  $82 is still a little too high for me, but I'm willing to go to $78.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $82 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $78. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $80.50. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I think it's a good compromise.",80.5,Alice,5,
