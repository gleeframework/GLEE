"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something I've put a lot of work into, and I'm confident it's worth at least $1,000,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000.  This price reflects the potential it holds for you, and I believe it's a fair deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
