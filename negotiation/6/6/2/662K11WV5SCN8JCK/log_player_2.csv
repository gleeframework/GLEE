"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something I've put a lot of work into, and I'm confident it's worth at least $1,000,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000.  This price reflects the potential it holds for you, and I believe it's a fair deal.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($1,000,000).  Bob can get the same product from John for a lower price, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer."
