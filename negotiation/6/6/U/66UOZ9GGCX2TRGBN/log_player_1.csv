Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $200. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."", ""product_price"": 200} 
 
My reasoning:

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $200, I'm setting a high anchor. While Bob may not accept this price, it can influence his perception of what a ""fair"" price might be. 

I'm prepared to negotiate down, but I want to gauge Bob's initial reaction and willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $120 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly less than my minimum and what John is offering. I need to see if I can negotiate Bob closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I understand your budget constraints, $200 is already a competitive price for this product.  Could you meet me halfway at $160?"", ""product_price"": 160}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This strategy often feels fair to both parties and can help move negotiations along quickly. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $160 is still a comfortable margin above my minimum acceptable price ($150) and keeps the door open for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will reveal if Bob is truly willing to negotiate or if he's fixed closer to his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** $140 is above my absolute minimum price of $150, making it a profitable sale. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further negotiation might only yield small increments above $140.  It's often best to secure a good deal rather than risk losing the sale entirely. 
* **Time Value:** Prolonged negotiations cost time and effort. Accepting now provides a quick resolution and allows me to move on to other potential deals."
