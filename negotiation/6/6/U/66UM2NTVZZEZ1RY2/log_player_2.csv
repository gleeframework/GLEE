# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both of us if you were to consider acquiring this item.

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. $12,000 is still above his maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price."

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target of $8,000.  There are still plenty of rounds left to reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 7

While Alice has come down in price to $9,000, Bob is getting close to running out of time. He's only got three rounds left.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to purchase the product from John for $8,000.  This secures the product at his desired price point and avoids the risk of Alice not budging further in the remaining rounds."
