"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay $150 for the product, and Alice is offering it for $150, it makes sense to accept her offer.  There's no benefit to rejecting and then buying from John at the same price."
