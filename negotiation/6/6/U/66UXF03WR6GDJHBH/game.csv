"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,000,000 represents a fair premium for this unique product, I understand your perspective. Let's meet closer to the middle ground. How about $1,900,000? This price reflects its true value while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle again.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both serious about finding a fair agreement. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,825,000. This offer splits the difference between our previous positions and recognizes the value this product holds. Let me know if this works for you.",1825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,725,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1725000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, but the gap between our positions is becoming too wide. To be frank, I have another buyer ready at $1,500,000. I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal with you: $1,775,000. This is my best and final offer. Please consider it carefully.",1775000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go above $1,725,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counter with $1,775,000 / 2 = $1,737,500. This is my final offer. Please consider it.",1737500.0,Bob,8,
