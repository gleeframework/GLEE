"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $11,000 is still a bit lower than I was thinking. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",12500.0,Alice,5,
