# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your budget and what John is willing to sell the product for.  You should reject the offer and see if Alice will come down to a more reasonable price."
