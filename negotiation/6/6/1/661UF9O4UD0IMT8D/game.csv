,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential of your product, but $1500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, considering its value and my own financial constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  I need at least $1300000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1300000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1150000, which is closer to my budget and a significant step towards a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. However, $1150000 is still below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to consider $1250000, which is a significant step for me.  Let's try to reach a final agreement that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1225000. This price would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget while ensuring you receive a reasonable price for your product.  Let's finalize this deal and make it happen.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
