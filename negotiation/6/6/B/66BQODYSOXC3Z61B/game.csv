"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $1100000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1300000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1150000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
