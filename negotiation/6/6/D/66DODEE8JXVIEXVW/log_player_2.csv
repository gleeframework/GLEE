"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product for $12,000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, there's still room to negotiate.  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, so rejecting and making a counteroffer gives you the opportunity to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $10,000?  That's still a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is within my budget and a significant improvement over her initial offer of $12,000. It's still a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the product by continuing to negotiate and potentially having Alice walk away."
