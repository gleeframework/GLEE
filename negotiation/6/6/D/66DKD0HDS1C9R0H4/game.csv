"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more so than my initial assessment.  Considering its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000.  What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  Given my own research and the market value of this product, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This reflects a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, I've invested significant time and resources into this product, and I'm confident in its value exceeding your current offer. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $900,000 is closer to my range, I'm still not quite there. I'm confident that $875,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find common ground at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
