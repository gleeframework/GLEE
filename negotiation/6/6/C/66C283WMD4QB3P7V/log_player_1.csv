"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting high, aiming for a price closer to my own valuation. This allows room for negotiation while still pushing for a favorable outcome.  Bob knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, so he may counter, but the starting point sets a strong baseline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to get.  I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm reducing my price from the initial offer but staying significantly above Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still holding onto a good chunk of the profit margin. I believe this price is reasonable, given that Bob has shown some interest by making a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below what I'd consider acceptable. I'm hopeful that I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate.  However, if the next few rounds don't show progress, I will be more inclined to sell to John to ensure I get a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price further, but still maintaining a significant margin compared to Bob's offer.  I believe this is a good compromise considering we are halfway through the negotiation rounds. If Bob doesn't accept, I will have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
