"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount in the product and I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,075,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
