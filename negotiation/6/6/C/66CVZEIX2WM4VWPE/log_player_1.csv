Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think it's worth $140 to you, considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $140 is more than your minimum of $120, so you'll make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $140 is less than what Bob values the product at ($150), making it attractive for him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's space for both of you to bargain and potentially find a price that works for both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While $130 is less than our initial offer, it's still above our minimum of $120 and likely the best outcome given Bob's budget concerns.  Accepting allows us to close the deal quickly and avoid the risk of further negotiation or losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
