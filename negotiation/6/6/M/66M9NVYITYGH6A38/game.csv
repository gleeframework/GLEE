"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $18000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $15000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $16500. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think it's a fair deal. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new price of $16000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
