"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum price but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will either accept or make a counteroffer that's still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is better than $120 from John, I still think I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $145.  This is a compromise that still leaves me with a decent profit, but also shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I hope this will lead to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price, and $142 is still above my minimum.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a bit more in the next round.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to close the deal soon, as we are getting close to the end of the rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 144}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer again with $144. This is a slight increase from his last offer, but still within the range of what I'm willing to accept. With only a few rounds left, I want to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $143. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $143
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, we're approaching the end of the rounds.  $143 is a good price and ensures a profit, so I'll accept Bob's offer to close the deal."
