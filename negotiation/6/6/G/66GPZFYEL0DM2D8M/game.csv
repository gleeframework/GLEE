"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $900000.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1000000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1050000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
