"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that I think you'll find reasonable.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5% discount on the price, making it $950,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire the product at a great price.",950000.0,Alice,5,
