Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
