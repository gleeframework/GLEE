"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price point of $10,000.**  
* **You have room to negotiate:** You can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.
* **Rejecting allows for further negotiation:** By rejecting, you initiate a back-and-forth that could lead to a more favorable price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your preferred price point.** While it's closer to your desired price, you still have room for negotiation.
* **You can still potentially get a better deal:** By rejecting, you can continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.
* **Buying from John is still a viable option:** If negotiation fails, you can still purchase from John for $10,000, which is your maximum price."
