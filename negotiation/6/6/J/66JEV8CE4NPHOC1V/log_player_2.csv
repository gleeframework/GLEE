"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $7,000 is a good deal, it's still possible to get a better price.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $6,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 6500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $6,900. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time I've invested in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get a lower price. While $6,900 is closer to his ideal price point, he can likely get it for even less. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $6,900 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. Let's split the difference and go with $6,700. This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 6700}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to give you a small concession and offer the product to you for $6,850. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time I've invested in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $6,850, which is just $150 more than Bob's last counteroffer. At this point, Bob is close to his goal of saving as much money as possible.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice could get stubborn or simply walk away.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a decent price, saving Bob a significant amount compared to buying from John."
