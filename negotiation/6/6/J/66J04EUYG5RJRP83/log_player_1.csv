Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's also a good starting point to see if Bob is serious about buying the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90.  While it's better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer of $105. This is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe it's fair, considering the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $100.  While Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  John is guaranteed to buy at my minimum price, so I'll take the sure thing."
