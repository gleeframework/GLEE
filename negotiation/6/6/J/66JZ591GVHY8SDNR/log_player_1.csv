Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $95.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good strategy to start negotiations slightly above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed, but also increases the chances of getting a higher price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $95 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer. If Bob is really interested, he might be willing to meet you somewhere in the middle. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John. Even if Bob rejects the offer, you're guaranteed to sell the product for its minimum value to you."
