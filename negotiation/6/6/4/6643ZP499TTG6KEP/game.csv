,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that 120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for 105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  However,  $105 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's my final offer.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to go as low as 90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between 105 and 90. How about we try 97.50? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate the compromise, but $97.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $90.  It's a fair price, and I'm ready to purchase if you agree.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm not willing to sell at 90. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we try 95? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",95.0,Alice,7,
