Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so anything above that is pure profit.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is only worth $800,000 to Bob. He won't rationally pay more.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $800,000 (Bob's max) and $1,200,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob walks away. Since you have a guaranteed sale with John, you're in a strong position. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential returns. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,100,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Confident Language:** The message frames the offer as valuable and emphasizes ""fairness.""
* **Open to Discussion:**  Ending with ""Let me know your thoughts"" encourages Bob to counter-offer and engage in negotiation.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared for Bob to:

* **Accept:**  Great! You've secured a profit above your minimum.
* **Counter-Offer:** Be ready to negotiate down slightly, but hold firm closer to your $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Reject:** No problem. You have John as a guaranteed buyer."
