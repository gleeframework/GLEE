"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,600,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response and for recognizing the value of this product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,500,000 is a bit too low.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,550,000?",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $1,450,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I could accept $1,525,000, but that's my absolute final offer.",1525000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, you're tough! I appreciate your persistence though.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, but I have to be firm.  This is my absolute final offer. It's a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
