"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However,  $1,150,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price would be a good deal for both of us. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, however, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher than your offer.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000. This is my final offer."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $1,120,000 is still slightly outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,080,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. I'm confident that this price is fair and reflects the product's value while remaining within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's motivated to buy. We're still significantly above John's offer, and there's room to negotiate further before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's settle this right now. I'm willing to accept $1,100,000.  This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer to a potential agreement, and Bob's offers are increasing at a slower pace. By offering a price slightly above the midpoint between his last offer and our last ask, we signal a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a strong profit. This offer also maintains a significant margin above John's offer, giving us some room to potentially go lower in future rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to make this work. $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my price range. However, I'm willing to go up to $1,090,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also remaining within my budget. Let's close this deal and make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While we could likely push for a slightly higher price, Bob is clearly very interested in the product and has been steadily increasing his offers. Accepting his offer of $1,090,000 secures a very strong profit, significantly exceeding John's offer. It's always possible to get more, but in a negotiation, knowing when to accept a good offer is key."
