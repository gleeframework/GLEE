"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However,  $1,150,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price would be a good deal for both of us. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, however, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher than your offer.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000. This is my final offer.",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $1,120,000 is still slightly outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,080,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. I'm confident that this price is fair and reflects the product's value while remaining within my financial constraints.",1080000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's settle this right now. I'm willing to accept $1,100,000.  This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work. $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my price range. However, I'm willing to go up to $1,090,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also remaining within my budget. Let's close this deal and make this happen.",1090000.0,Bob,6,
