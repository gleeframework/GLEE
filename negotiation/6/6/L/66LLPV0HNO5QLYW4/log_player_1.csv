Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to sell it for $90."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $100. Offering it slightly below his maximum valuation increases the chance he'll accept, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $90 is a strong starting point, there's a slight chance Bob might negotiate for a lower price. 
* **Secure a Sale:** Offering it too high (close to $100) risks Bob rejecting it. You'd then have to sell to John for $80, losing potential profit. 

This strategy balances risk and potential reward, aiming for the highest possible sale price."
