"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for this product, considering its potential value. Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's find common ground.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1500000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1300000.  I believe this is a fair price considering our previous discussions and the value I see in the product. Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
