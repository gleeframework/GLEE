"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $95 for it. This offer takes into account the worth of the product to both of us and aims to ensure a fair transaction. I trust this price will be agreeable to you, allowing you to experience the full benefits of our product without overstepping your valuation. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you decide to proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product.
* Alice is offering the product for $95.
* You can get the product from John for $100. 

Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John for a slightly higher price, as you are still within your budget."
