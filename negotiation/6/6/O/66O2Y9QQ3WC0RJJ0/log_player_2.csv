"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You can likely negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value to me, and it gives you a good return as well.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still higher than Bob's maximum budget. This allows for room for negotiation while still giving Bob a chance to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering the product to you for $10,200. This is a fair price, considering the value to you and the value I place on the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $10,000.  Since John is offering the product for Bob's maximum, it's the most sensible option to avoid any further negotiation and secure the product at the best possible price."
