"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value to me, and it gives you a good return as well.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering the product to you for $10,200. This is a fair price, considering the value to you and the value I place on the product. Let me know what you think.",10200.0,Alice,3,
