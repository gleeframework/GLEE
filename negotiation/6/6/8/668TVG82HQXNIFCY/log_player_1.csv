Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm suggesting a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 allows some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Strong Alternative:** I have a strong backup offer from John at $800,000, giving me leverage.
* **Confidence:**  The message projects confidence in the product's value, making it more likely Bob will accept a high price."
