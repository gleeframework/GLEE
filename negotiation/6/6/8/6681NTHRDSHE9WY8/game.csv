,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $105.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's try to close this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a little bit higher than that.  Let's split the difference. How about $100?  It's fair for both of us, and we can close this deal. ",100.0,Alice,5,
