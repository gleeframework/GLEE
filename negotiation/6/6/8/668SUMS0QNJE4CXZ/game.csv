"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $720,000?",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $720,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $780,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",780000.0,Alice,5,
