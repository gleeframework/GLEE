Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort in coming down on the price. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to pay $812500. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $815,000, Bob's offer of $812,500 is very close and likely the best I can do at this point.  It's more than what I'd get from John and only a small distance from my ideal price.  I'll accept it."
