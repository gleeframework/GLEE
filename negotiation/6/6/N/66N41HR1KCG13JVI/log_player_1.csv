"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $150, but not so high as to scare Bob away immediately. I want to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $180 is better than my minimum, it's still lower than my initial asking price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
