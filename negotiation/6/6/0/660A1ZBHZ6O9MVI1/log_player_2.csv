Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $75, but I'm willing to make another concession. How about we try $85? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you.

While Alice is getting closer to your ideal price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $85. You can get the product for $80 from John, so it makes the most financial sense to buy from John at this point."
