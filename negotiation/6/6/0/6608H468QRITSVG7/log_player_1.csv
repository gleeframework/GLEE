Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

This strategy aims high while still leaving room for negotiation. It acknowledges the product's value to Bob, making him more likely to engage in a back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your proposal, but I believe we can reach a more favorable agreement for both parties. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to suggest a counteroffer of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While $1,200,000 is a good offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's message suggests he's motivated to buy and willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a significant step down from my initial ask.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, given my financial constraints, I must respectfully decline your latest offer. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,225,000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise that allows us to move forward with the transaction while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob is clearly very interested in the product and is negotiating in good faith. Accepting $1,225,000 secures a substantial profit above your minimum and avoids the risk of pushing Bob away with further counteroffers."
