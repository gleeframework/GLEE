I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's continue this conversation and find a solution that works for both our needs.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. $1,000,000 is getting closer, but we're still a bit apart.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects the value proposition for you. Let's find a way to make this deal work.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
