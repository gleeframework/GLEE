Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Considering the negotiation so far, I propose a price of $12,000 for the product. This aligns closely with your last offer and also respects the value we both see in the product. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations.

Alice has come down to her product's value.  It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and this is a good price for me."
