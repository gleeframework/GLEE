"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is high-quality, I think $15,000 is a little steep. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $12,500 for the product. This still reflects its high value, but it's more in line with what we've discussed. Let me know if this works for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, I'm still finding it hard to justify $12,500. Could we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. Considering the negotiation so far, I propose a price of $12,000 for the product. This aligns closely with your last offer and also respects the value we both see in the product. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations.",12000.0,Alice,5,
