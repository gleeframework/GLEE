Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $120 as possible, but still offer a price enticing to Bob. 
* **Bob's Value:** You know Bob values the product at $100. Offering it slightly below your guaranteed sale price of $120 creates a potential win-win.
* **Slight Negotiation Buffer:**  The $119 price leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly eager, but still nets you a great profit."
