"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $130? ",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, $130 is still a bit too steep for me.  Could you do $75?  That would be a fair deal.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I can't do $75, I could be persuaded to go down to $110.  This is my final offer.",110.0,Alice,5,
