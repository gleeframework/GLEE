"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's a valuable asset, and this price reflects its worth while still allowing you a healthy profit margin. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800,000. I would like to make a counteroffer at $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is significantly below what this product is truly worth. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This price still allows you a good margin and ensures a mutually beneficial deal. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budgetary limitations, Alice. While $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my range, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer at $950,000. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to get for this product. Let's split the difference and settle at $1,025,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've carefully considered your proposal, and I'm willing to move forward with a counteroffer at $1,000,000. This brings us closer together, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us. I look forward to your response.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
