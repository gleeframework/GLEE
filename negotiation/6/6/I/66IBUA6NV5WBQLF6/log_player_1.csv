Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible from Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit above his perceived value.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, so there's no risk of losing money. This strong position allows us to be firm in our negotiation with Bob. 

By offering a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than our guaranteed sale price, we create a win-win scenario if Bob is willing to negotiate."
