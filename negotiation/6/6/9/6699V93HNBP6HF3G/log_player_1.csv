Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $149. It's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $149 makes it seem like a ""deal"" compared to John's offer. This might entice Bob to buy even though it's slightly above his perceived value. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate, or he might reject it outright."
