"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still above Bob's desired price point.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to Alice's valuation as possible, as that is likely to be the point where she's most willing to sell. $10,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's desired price point, it's still too high. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better deal if he continues to counteroffer.  Buying from John at this point would be more expensive than accepting Alice's offer, so it's not the optimal choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his desired price point, but still wants to save as much as possible.  $11,000 is a compromise between Alice's previous offer and Bob's desired price.  It also leaves room for Alice to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price.  While it's closer to Bob's preferred price, there is still potential to negotiate a lower price.  The risk of buying from John is still greater than the risk of continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to inch closer to his target price, but is mindful of not pushing Alice too hard. $11,500 is a compromise that demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate, but also shows that he values the product and is prepared to pay a fair price.  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining a good chance of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price point.  While it's getting closer, Bob still believes he can negotiate a lower price.  The risk of buying from John is still higher than the risk of continuing the negotiation, and there are still several rounds remaining to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to increase his offer slightly, recognizing that time is running out. $12,000 is a significant increase from his previous offer but still allows for some profit for Alice. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's seriousness in reaching an agreement, while also staying within his budget. With only a few rounds left, this offer may be the last chance to secure a deal before resorting to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than he's willing to pay.  There is only one round left, and Bob is still hoping to secure a better price.  If Alice is unwilling to budge, then buying from John is still a viable option in this situation.  

Bob is taking a calculated risk by rejecting this offer. There's a chance Alice might not counteroffer, but there's also a chance she might drop her price to make a deal happen. The final round is a gamble, but the potential savings are worth it for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final offer.  He's increasing his bid again, demonstrating his commitment to reaching an agreement.  $12,500 is still a significant discount from Alice's last offer and leaves her with a profit.  This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial deal, and Bob is willing to walk away if Alice rejects it.

If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will have no choice but to buy from John for $15,000.  This final offer is a last-ditch effort to secure a better price."
