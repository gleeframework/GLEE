"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000? I'm very interested in purchasing the product and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that your budget is limited, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $18000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but unfortunately, I am still unable to meet at $18000. I would like to propose $16000 as my final offer. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $16000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to know you're serious about buying the product. I'm offering it to you for $22000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",22000.0,Alice,5,
