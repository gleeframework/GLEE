"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your target price of $1,500,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. While I understand you have a budget, the product's value to you is significant. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000. This allows me to make a profit while still providing you with a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,000,000 is still above your ideal price, but it's significantly lower than her initial offer and brings the price closer to your budget.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll end up paying more to John. It's more strategic to accept this offer and save $500,000 compared to buying from John."
