Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I'm open to some negotiation. How about $10,500?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable going below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $10,900?

Alice doesn't seem willing to budge much below $10,900.  It's unlikely we'll get a better deal from her than John's offer of $10,000."
