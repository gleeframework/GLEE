"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I believe it will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start the negotiations with a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive offer, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000.

"Hello Alice, thank you for the opening offer. This product is definitely interesting to me, but your initial price is a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000.  I believe that's a fair offer considering its value and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a significant concession, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the value you'll get from the product. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000. I believe this demonstrates my serious interest in the product while acknowledging the need for a price that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $975,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to give up too much more. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product and the value you'll get from it. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my target price. However, I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is a final compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. If not, I'll need to reconsider the deal and explore other options.
