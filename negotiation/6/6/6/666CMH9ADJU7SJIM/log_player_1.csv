Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed while still potentially securing a higher profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $150 offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer and feel like he's getting a deal if the price lowers during the negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option (John):**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 seems a little steep for me. Would you consider $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $75 is significantly below both your minimum price ($100) and his own perceived value of the product ($100).  Accepting this would mean a significant loss for you. It's highly likely there's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness to Negotiate:**  By countering, you demonstrate flexibility and a desire to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Significant Jump from Bob's Offer:** While moving closer to your minimum, the $120 counteroffer is still a significant increase from Bob's $75, signaling that you're serious about a higher price point. 
* **Reasoning with Bob:** The ""meet in the middle"" approach aims to make the offer seem more appealing and fair to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However,  $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to come down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Close to Bob's Value:**  Bob's offer of $90 is above your absolute minimum ($100) and quite close to his own stated value of the product ($100). 
* **Diminishing Returns in Further Negotiation:** While you could potentially squeeze out a few more dollars, it's unlikely Bob will go much higher. Continuing the negotiation risks him walking away entirely.
* **Guaranteed Profit vs. Uncertainty:** Accepting $90 secures a profit and avoids the risk of having to settle for John's offer of $100, which would be the same as your minimum acceptable price from Bob."
