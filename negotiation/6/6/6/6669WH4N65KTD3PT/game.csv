"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I have to make a living too! I can meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $160 for it. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still more than I can afford.  I'm firm at $100. If that doesn't work for you, I'll need to look at other options.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I really appreciate you trying to work with me, but $140 is still out of my price range. I'm sticking with my offer of $100. It's a fair price, and if you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to move on.",100.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $145 for the product. That's my final offer. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,7,
