"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of [Product Name], but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $500000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in [Product Name]. While $500000 is a significant amount, it doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1200000, which is still a fair price considering the potential benefits it offers.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I am still not able to meet your current offer. I would like to propose $900000 as a counteroffer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is still significantly below the value of [Product Name]. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1000000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain from owning this unique product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
