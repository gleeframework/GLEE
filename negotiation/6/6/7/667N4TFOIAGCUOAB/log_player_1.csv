"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $130, which is a bit above my minimum of $100, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  Using a friendly and positive tone encourages Bob to engage and hopefully see the value of the product.
* **Open to negotiation:** By asking ""What do you think?"", I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. I would like to propose a price of $110 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for better deal:** While $110 is better than John's offer of $100, I believe there's still room for a higher price, given the product's worth of $150 to Bob. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer and try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $110 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can get a bit closer. How about $120? That would still give you a great deal, and it would be more in line with what I'm looking for.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  
* **Highlighting benefits:** I'm emphasizing that a price of $120 is still a great deal for Bob, and helps me achieve a better outcome.
* **Collaborative tone:**  I'm emphasizing finding a solution that works for both of us, promoting a more positive and cooperative atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'd like to counter with $115 for the product. This still saves me some money compared to the other option available to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** $115 is only $5 away from my previous offer of $120. This is a good compromise, and I'm getting closer to my desired outcome.
* **Limited time:** We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Bob seems willing to negotiate, and I believe this is a good price considering the product's value to him.
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  While John is a fallback option, accepting this offer ensures a higher profit than selling to him."
