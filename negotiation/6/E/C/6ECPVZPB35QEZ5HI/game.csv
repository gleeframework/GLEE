"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $7,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we compromise at $8,500? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $8,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I think I can do a bit better than that. How about we meet at $8,200? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too.",8200.0,Alice,5,
