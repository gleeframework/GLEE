# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,600.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

It's unlikely Alice will come down significantly from this point. She's sticking to a price above your maximum, and you have a guaranteed option with John at your target price."
