"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a good deal on a valuable product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
