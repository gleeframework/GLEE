"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $9,500?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can we try to meet somewhere in between?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,500 simply doesn't cover my costs. To make this work for both of us, how about $10,000? It's a fair price that considers your budget while still allowing me to make a profit. Let's close this deal!",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $10,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I'm not willing to go any higher. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",9500.0,Bob,6,
