Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John, it's always best to try for a higher profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $145 is slightly below your guaranteed price but still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($120). 
* **Potential for Acceptance:** There's a chance Bob might find the offer appealing enough to accept, especially if he perceives the product as having some additional value not factored into his initial $120 valuation.

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
