"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere. Let's make this happen!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,500,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value, and allows us both to walk away happy.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your initial offer and my previous offer, which would be $1,350,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there. While your offer is closer, I'm willing to drop to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope you can understand my position.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
