Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $125. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I don't actually know how much Bob values the product.  Assuming he's a rational buyer, he'll buy it for any price at or below $80, but I want to maximize my profit.
* **Starting High:** I start with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Leaving Room for Profit:** Even if Bob accepts this offer, I'm still making a significant profit compared to selling to John. 

**Important Note:** This assumes I have no way of knowing Bob's true valuation. If I had more information, I could adjust my strategy accordingly."
