"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer you a great deal on it. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9500. This is a fantastic price, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a decent price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000).  There's room for negotiation, and I have 9 more rounds to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This reflects its value and allows for a fair profit for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still willing to negotiate further. I have more rounds available, and Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise. I'll try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000.  I'm still a bit higher than where I want to be.  I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8750. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $8800. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $8,800 is close to my target price.  I've already rejected two of her offers and we're nearing the midpoint of the negotiation. It's likely that continuing to bargain might not yield a significantly better price, and I risk losing the opportunity to purchase the product from Alice altogether. 

Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a reasonable price, and I can avoid the risk of having to buy it from John at a much higher price."
