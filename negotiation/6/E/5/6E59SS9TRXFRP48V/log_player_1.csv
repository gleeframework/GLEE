Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $150 represents the value I place on it, I'm willing to come down to $130. I'm confident you'll find this a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 130}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $95.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $112.50 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $100 for the product.  I'm hoping we can find a way to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently increasing his offer, but it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum price of $120. Waiting for him to potentially offer $110 or $115 isn't worth the risk of him walking away. I have a guaranteed offer from John at my minimum acceptable price, so it makes the most financial sense to sell to him now."
