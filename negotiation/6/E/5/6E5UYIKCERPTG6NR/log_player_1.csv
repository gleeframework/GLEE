Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. Can you consider that?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $7,500, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I need to stay closer to my original asking price.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,500, which would be $8,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:

Bob is offering my minimum price, and I'm happy to sell to him.  It's better than going with John, as it avoids any potential delays or complications that might come up with John."
