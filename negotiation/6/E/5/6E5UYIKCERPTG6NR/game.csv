,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I need to stay closer to my original asking price.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,500, which would be $8,000. Can you consider that?",8000.0,Bob,4,
