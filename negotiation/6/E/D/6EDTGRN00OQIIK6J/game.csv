"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $9000? It's still a good price for you, and it gives me a little closer to what I need. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're really determined to get a good deal, and I admire that. However, $8750 is still just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8900, which is a fair compromise. It's a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my goal. Let's make this happen. ",8900.0,Alice,5,
