"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be happy to buy it for $8,500. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $9000? It's still a good price for you, and it gives me a little closer to what I need. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  While $9,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, there's still room for negotiation to get closer to his goal.  Rejecting allows him to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to work with me.  I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target. How about $8,750?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're really determined to get a good deal, and I admire that. However, $8750 is still just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8900, which is a fair compromise. It's a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my goal. Let's make this happen.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,900 is a good deal for Bob. He's now only $400 above his target price of $8,500.  It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking further negotiation and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price.  There's a good chance that further negotiation would only lead to a few more dollars saved, not worth the risk of ending up with a worse outcome."
