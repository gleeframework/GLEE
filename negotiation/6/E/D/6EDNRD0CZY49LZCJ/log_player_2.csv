"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John offers. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $180 is too high for my budget. I'm interested, but only if it's closer to $100."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, which might seem aggressive.  However, it accomplishes a few things:

* **Establishes a strong starting point:**  It leaves room for negotiation while making it clear you're serious about a lower price.
* **Gauges Alice's flexibility:**  Her response will tell you how willing she is to negotiate.
* **Keeps the John option open:** You haven't committed to anything and can still buy from John at $120 if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $180 is my initial asking price, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet halfway at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $140 is still above your maximum price and John's offer. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about $110? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy right now at that price."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Splits the difference (almost):** This offer is close to the midpoint between your previous offer ($100) and her current one ($140), showing you're willing to compromise.
* **Creates urgency:** By stating you're ""ready to buy right now,"" you add a bit of pressure for Alice to accept.
* **Still above John:** Your offer is still slightly better than John's price, giving Alice an incentive to accept."
