"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's discuss a price point that works for both of us. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $900,000 is still higher than her own valuation of $800,000, indicating there's room for negotiation. 
* Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John at $1,000,000."
