"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but her starting price is already $900,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so you can try to get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  You want to see if you can get a better deal with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair, considering the value you place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still well above her minimum desired price.
* **Sets the tone for negotiation:**  It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate seriously and shows you're not afraid to push for a better deal.
* **Provides space for a middle ground:**  This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to counter with a price closer to your target while still allowing you to save a substantial amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my minimum target. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and I'm confident we can work together to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she's shown willingness to negotiate, $850,000 is still above your target price. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You have 7 rounds left, so there's time to try to get a lower price.
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.**  You want to continue negotiating with Alice to see if you can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value you place on the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this figure."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Alice halfway:**  This counteroffer is exactly halfway between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows you're willing to compromise while still trying to get a good price.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  The message highlights that $800,000 is a fair price for both parties.
* **Setting the stage for a potential deal:**  This offer positions you closer to Alice's preferred price while still leaving some room for negotiation if necessary."
