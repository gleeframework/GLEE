"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair, considering the value you place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my minimum target. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and I'm confident we can work together to finalize the deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value you place on the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this figure.",800000.0,Bob,4,
