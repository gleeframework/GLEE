"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is a good price, you can potentially get a better deal. By rejecting the offer, you open the opportunity for Alice to lower her price further, especially since she values the product at $8,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, and it's very close to what I would pay for the product from John. It's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price, even if it means potentially paying a little more to John in the end."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is showing that she's not willing to drop her price significantly.  At this point, it's getting closer to the price I'd pay John, and I'm not confident I can negotiate a better deal with Alice. It's better to just buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
