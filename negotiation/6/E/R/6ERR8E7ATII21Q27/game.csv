"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your offer. However, $70 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $80 to make this worthwhile. How about $85? It's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from $90. However, $85 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $85. How about $77.50? It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $77.50 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $82.50? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $82.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about $79.50? It's a small adjustment, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's try to find a deal that works for both of us.",79.5,Bob,6,
