"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1100000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1200000 is above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $850000 for it. This is a fair price considering my value for the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $950000, but I think that's as low as I can go. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $950000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $900000.  Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $920000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What are your thoughts?",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $920000 is a good offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $850000. To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to increase my offer to $880000.  This is a fair price, considering my value for the product, and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal and find a price we're both happy with.",880000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current offers. I can offer it to you for $900000, which is the same price I offered in round 4. This is my final concession, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.
