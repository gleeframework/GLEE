"I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $11000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate that. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to compromise again. I can do $10500. That's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",10500.0,Alice,5,
