"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its high quality and unique features, it's valued at $150 by me. Considering its worth to you is $120, I believe we can find a fair deal. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is closer to your $120 valuation than her initial $150, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  It makes the most financial sense to go with the guaranteed lower price."
