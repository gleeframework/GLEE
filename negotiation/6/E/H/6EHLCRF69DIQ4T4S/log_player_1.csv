Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a sample offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to him. 
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000. This is your leverage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away. Since his value matches your minimum, you have some room to negotiate.

**Sample Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique features and market potential, I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you.  I'm proposing a price of $950,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:**  The message starts by highlighting the product's value, setting a positive tone.
* **Strong Price:**  $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while securing a significant profit if Bob accepts.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The phrasing encourages Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (e.g., $900,000).
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, a less aggressive starting point might be preferred.
* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** This is just the opening move. Be ready for Bob to counter-offer, and have a strategy for how low you're willing to go. 

Remember, you always have John as a backup, guaranteeing you at least $800,000!"
