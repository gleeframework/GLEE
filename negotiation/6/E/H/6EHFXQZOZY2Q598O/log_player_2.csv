"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, even if there's a chance she won't budge.  You can always fall back on buying from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a deal, but also sets a clear limit.  If Alice rejects this, we can then start adjusting the price upwards."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget. Although it's closer to my maximum, I still want to try and negotiate a lower price.  If Alice rejects my next counteroffer, I'll be happy to buy from John."

I'm increasing my offer by $150,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway. This leaves room for further negotiation if necessary, but it's still within my budget."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum.  There's a chance I can get a better deal with another counteroffer. However, if this fails, I'll be comfortable buying from John."

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, this time by $50,000.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want to keep the price within a reasonable range.  If she accepts, great! If not, I'm ready to buy from John at $1,000,000."
