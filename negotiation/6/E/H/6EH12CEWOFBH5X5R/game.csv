"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $25000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to offer $12000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $12000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $20000 is still out of my range.  I'm firm on $15000.  This is my final offer, let me know if it works for you.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid $15000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about the value of this product. Let me think for a moment... Okay, I'll make a new offer: $22000. This is my best and final offer, I'm afraid.",22000.0,Alice,5,
