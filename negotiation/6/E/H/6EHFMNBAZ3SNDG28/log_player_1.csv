Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would bring you significant value at $11,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a baseline of $10,000, it's always best to aim higher initially.
* **Leave Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $11,500 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere above your minimum. 
* **Perceived Value:** Highlighting ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant value"" subtly anchors the product's worth in Bob's mind. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and potential counter-offers. Remember, any price above $10,000 is a win!"
