"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fantastic opportunity"" to emphasize the potential value to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to engage in the conversation, showing flexibility. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value as possible while keeping the negotiation open.  I'll use the subsequent rounds to assess Bob's willingness to pay and adjust my offers accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and I'm willing to make a serious offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as there's still room for improvement.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:** While I'd prefer to get a better price from Bob, selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed option if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions.  I'll also be mindful of the remaining rounds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, recognizing your interest.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and its potential for you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer is $400,000 higher than Bob's offer, but $150,000 lower than my previous offer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential value to him, while also highlighting my willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and open to further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to get a price closer to my minimum, while also leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. I'm keeping in mind the remaining rounds and the possibility of selling to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1400000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob has moved closer to my price, $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Opportunity to close the gap:**  There's still room for improvement, and I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Time is running out:**  I have only 6 rounds remaining, so I need to carefully consider the risk of further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my minimum, aiming to find a compromise that works for both of us. I will also factor in the remaining rounds and the possibility of selling to John if negotiations with Bob stall."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000, which is closer to your offer and still reflects the value I place on the product.  I'm eager to reach a mutually agreeable solution and finalize the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground on this price."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  This offer is just $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price, demonstrating my commitment to reaching a deal while still protecting my interests.
* **Compromise Signal:**  By lowering my offer to $1,450,000, I am showing willingness to meet halfway again and create a sense of urgency for Bob to finalize the deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a positive and encouraging tone, hoping to motivate Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Risk Assessment:**  I'm taking a slight risk by dropping below my minimum, but I believe this is necessary to get a deal done quickly.
* **Time Factor:**  With only 5 rounds left, I'm taking a more aggressive approach to close the deal, recognizing the possibility of selling to John if negotiations with Bob fail.
* **Negotiation Tactics:**  I'm using a ""meet halfway"" strategy to create a sense of urgency and push Bob to accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1350000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, the risk of further negotiations with Bob is too high.
* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $1,350,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John is a guaranteed deal:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed way to achieve my minimum goal.

**Strategy:**

I've reached a point where the risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential reward.  Selling to John now ensures I meet my minimum target and avoid the uncertainty of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
