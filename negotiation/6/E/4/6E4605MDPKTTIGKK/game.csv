"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer of $600,000 is lower than I anticipated, I'm willing to negotiate. Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $900,000. This price still provides a significant benefit to you, and allows me to move forward with a deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is closer, but I still need it to be a bit lower. How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to keep working with you.  $700,000 is still a bit too far off from what I need, but I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This offer reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome.  Let's make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,5,
