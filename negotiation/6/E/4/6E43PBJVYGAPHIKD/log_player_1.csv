Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to do $8,500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

I'm going to try to get a bit closer to my target price of $10,000 before considering John's offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your budget, $8,500 is a bit lower than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would like to get closer to my target price of $10,000,  $9,000 is a good deal and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely."
