"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value it offers you.  Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,250,000?  This still provides you with a significant savings, and it allows me to make a more reasonable profit.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
