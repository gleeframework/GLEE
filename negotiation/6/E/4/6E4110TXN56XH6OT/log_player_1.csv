Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know its value is significant to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000. Let me know your decision, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a significantly higher price ($1,800,000) sets a strong anchor. Even though it's unlikely Bob will accept this initial offer, it sets the stage for negotiation and makes your fallback price of $1,000,000 (to John) seem more reasonable.
* **Scarcity:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob reinforces its importance and justifies the high asking price. 
 
**Important:** This is just an opening move. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters.  You know your walk-away price is $1,000,000, giving you room to maneuver."
