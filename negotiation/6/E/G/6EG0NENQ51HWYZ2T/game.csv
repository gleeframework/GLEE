"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While the product sounds interesting, $750000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $500000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $675000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",675000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $675000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $600000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $600000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $650000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a great value for the product.",650000.0,Alice,5,
