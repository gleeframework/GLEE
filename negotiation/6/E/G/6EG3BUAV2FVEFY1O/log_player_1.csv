Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. I think it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $110 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 right now. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $85 is better than nothing, I can likely get closer to my target price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $90, which is a fair compromise.  Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $90 is a good price considering my minimum target was $100, and it's a significant improvement over his previous offer. There are still rounds left, but it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
