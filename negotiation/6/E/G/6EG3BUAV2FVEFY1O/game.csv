"Alice, $110 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 right now. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make a deal.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $90, which is a fair compromise.  Let's make this happen!",90.0,Bob,4,
