The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $1,800,000. This is too high. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2

It's the final round, and Alice's offer is still above Bob's ideal price.  While there's a chance Alice could lower her price further, it's too risky to gamble.

This ensures Bob gets the product at his desired price and avoids the risk of ending the negotiation without a purchase."
