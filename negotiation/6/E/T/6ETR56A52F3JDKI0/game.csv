,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,750 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $8,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product.  Let's try to close this deal.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,250. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to me. I think it's a fair compromise.",8500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While I see the value in the product,  $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,100.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",8100.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your final offer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,050. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to give away the product at a price that's below its worth to me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,200. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",8200.0,Alice,9,
