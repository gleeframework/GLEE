"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product but my budget is a bit tighter. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $975,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit. I'm still not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll offer the product to you for $950,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,5,
