Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you a compromise at $11,500. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you $11,000. This is the best I can do, considering the value of the product to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been diligently negotiating and is close to his ideal price point.  Accepting the offer at $11,000 saves him a significant amount compared to buying from John and keeps the negotiations moving forward.  There's a chance that Bob could continue negotiating and potentially get an even lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away or the deal falling apart is increasing. It's a good time to lock in a favorable price."
