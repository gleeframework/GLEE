"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000, as I want to maximize my profits. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price, but I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm also hoping that Bob's perceived value of the product is higher than $10,000, which would make him more likely to engage in negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than my minimum, it's still lower than my initial offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore it further. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate, but still leaves me with a decent profit margin. This counteroffer allows me to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway while also keeping me within my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the limited time we have.  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate and meet me halfway. If I reject this offer, I risk losing him as a buyer and having to accept the lower price from John."
