Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer of $8,200. I'm trying to get as close to the product's value to Alice ($8,000) as possible, while still saving some money.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,200 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $8,800 to make this worthwhile. What do you think?

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to negotiate a better price. I'll make a counteroffer of $8,300. This is still a bit above the product's value to Alice, but I'm hoping she'll be willing to meet me in the middle.
