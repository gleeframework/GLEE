I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, I'm willing to take a risk and see if Bob bites."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's a decent price, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round, trying to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $16,500. It's still above what Bob offered, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping to find a compromise that's beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  He's moved up a bit, and while I'd like to get more, I'm not sure how much wiggle room he has left.  This is a good deal, and I'm not confident I can get a better offer before I need to sell to John."
