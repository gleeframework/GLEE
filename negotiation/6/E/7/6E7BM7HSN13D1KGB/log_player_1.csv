Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's value for the product but below my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and creates a potential win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is too low. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $130 is still below what I'm willing to accept.  Since I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150, I'll take that option and avoid any further negotiation."
