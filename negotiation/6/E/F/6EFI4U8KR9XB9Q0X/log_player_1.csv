"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still within a range that Bob might consider (knowing his value is $80).
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer in a friendly and positive way to build rapport. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counter without sounding inflexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it shows he's still interested. There's potential to reach a compromise.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  I'm keeping in mind that selling to John for $150 is always a viable alternative if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $60 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  Would you be willing to consider $120?  This would still give you a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** $120 is a significant step down from my initial offer but still above my minimum. It shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Focus on value:** I highlight the value of the product to encourage Bob to see it as a good deal.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a friendly and open tone to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about $80? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $80 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, even though it's closer.
* **There's still room for negotiation:** Bob has shown he's willing to increase his offer. I believe there's still potential to reach a deal closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob continue to fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $80 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's split the difference. How about $100? It's a fair price for both of us and ensures you get a great product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a price that is halfway between my previous offer ($120) and Bob's offer ($80). This shows a willingness to compromise and meet in the middle.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing that the price is fair for both of us, rather than focusing on what I'm losing. 
* **Highlight value:** I'm reminding Bob that he's getting a great product for a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, $90 is still below my desired price. 
* **Potential to reach a better deal:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and is closer to my minimum. I believe there's still potential to reach a higher price.
* **Selling to John is a safe fallback:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and see we're getting closer. However, $90 is still a little below what I need to make this worthwhile. Would you consider $105? That's a fair compromise, and you'd still be getting a great product at a great price."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight increase:**  I'm increasing the price slightly from my previous offer, showing I'm not willing to drop below $100. 
* **""Fair compromise"" framing:** I'm emphasizing that this price is a compromise to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Reinforcing value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and the good deal he's getting."
