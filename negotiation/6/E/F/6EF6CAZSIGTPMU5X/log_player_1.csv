Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 
 
Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** By starting at $140, Alice aims to capture the majority of the value Bob places on the product ($150). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but still ensures a significant profit margin.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $100 provides a safety net.  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't risk going below her minimum acceptable price.
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** Offering the product for a price significantly lower than Bob's perceived value might make him suspicious or undervalue the product."
