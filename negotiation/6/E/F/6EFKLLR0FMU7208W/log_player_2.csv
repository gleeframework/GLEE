# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it!

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $12000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further. You could potentially get the product for a price closer to your limit."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. If you're open to that, we can make a deal. Otherwise, I'm going to have to go with another option."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $11500. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $11,500 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  While it is tempting to continue negotiations, it's likely that Alice won't go any lower.  Therefore, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $10,000, saving me $1,500."
