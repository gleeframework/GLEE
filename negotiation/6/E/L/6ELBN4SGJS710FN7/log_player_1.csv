Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $1,850,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000.

We're getting closer, but I still think there's room for Bob to come up a bit. It's too early to settle for anything less than $1,875,000 at this point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we split the difference again and land at $1,875,000?  This feels like a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $1,825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,825,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I'd prefer to hold out for more, Bob is clearly anchored around a price point well below my ideal.  Accepting at $1,825,000 secures a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely."
