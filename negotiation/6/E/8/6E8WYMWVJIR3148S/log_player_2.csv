"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $1,000,000 is still outside his desired price range. It's best to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to Bob's desired price range, it's still a bit high.  He has a backup option with John for $800,000, so there's no need to rush into an agreement. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $900,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $925,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his goal of $800,000, but $925,000 is still too high. There are still rounds left, and Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. It's important to remember that Bob has a backup option with John, which gives him leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my target price, but $925,000 is still a bit out of reach. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $910,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 910000}
