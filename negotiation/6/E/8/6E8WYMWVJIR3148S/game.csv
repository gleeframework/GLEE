"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's make a deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $900,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $925,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's work together to make this happen.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my target price, but $925,000 is still a bit out of reach. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $910,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to finalize this deal.",910000.0,Bob,6,
