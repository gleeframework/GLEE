"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, close to my minimum, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'm leaving some room for negotiation but not giving away too much value in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, but it's getting closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round.  I want to see if I can squeeze a little more out of him before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping he sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not acceptable.  I'm going to reject his offer and continue to negotiate with him. I have several rounds left and I don't want to settle for a price that's too low, especially when I have a guaranteed buyer in John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,000. This is a further compromise from my last offer, and it's only slightly above Bob's last offer. I'm hoping that by showing a willingness to meet him halfway, I can finally reach an agreement with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me.  I'm not going to settle for a price that's below my minimum.  I'll reject his offer and try to reach a higher price with him in the next few rounds. I still have several rounds left before I have to decide to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750} 
```

I'm going to counter with $9,750. This is a significant reduction from my last offer, and it's only $750 above Bob's last offer.  We are getting close to a deal and I want to make sure I don't lose him.   I'm hoping that this compromise will be enough to convince Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate with Bob. Although I'm getting closer to my minimum price, his offers are still below what I'd like to earn. It's not worth risking another rejection and potentially having to sell at a price lower than my minimum. I'm going to take the guaranteed offer from John and sell to him for $12,000."
