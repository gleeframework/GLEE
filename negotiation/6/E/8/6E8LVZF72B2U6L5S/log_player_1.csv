Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $125. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation or allows you to settle closer to your minimum.
* **Staying Above Bob's Value:** The price of $125 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $80. While it's unlikely he'll accept this price, it keeps the door open for further negotiation.
* **Below Your Guaranteed Sale:** This price is still comfortably below your guaranteed sale price of $150 from John. This means even if Bob negotiates you down a bit, you're still making a profit.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly if Bob counters or shows reluctance.  The key is to find a price that works for both of you."
