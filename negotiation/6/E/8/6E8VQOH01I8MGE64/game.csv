"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is truly significant. I could be flexible, but $1,100,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're right, we are getting closer.  I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To show my good faith, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $1,200,000 even? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging our progress in this negotiation.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is getting us very close!  I appreciate you coming down. How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,196,250? ",1196250.0,Bob,8,
