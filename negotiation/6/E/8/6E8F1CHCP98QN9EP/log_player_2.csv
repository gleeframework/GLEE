"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a very competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's a good deal, but Bob can likely do better. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit and me to acquire the product within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Bob is still looking to save as much money as possible. He should continue negotiating with Alice, trying to get a price closer to his ideal range."

# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,125,000. This is a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Bob has negotiated a good price. While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might walk away, and he'd have to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer saves him $375,000 compared to buying from John."
