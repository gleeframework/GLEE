"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a very competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I do appreciate the value this product holds, $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit and me to acquire the product within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This would be a fair price, and I'm confident we can both be happy with the outcome.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,125,000. This is a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
