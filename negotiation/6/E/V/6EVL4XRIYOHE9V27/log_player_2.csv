"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still $50,000 above his maximum.  It's worth continuing to negotiate.  There's a good chance Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to pay $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $825,001. This is a very slight adjustment, but I'm willing to meet you at this price to get the deal done. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $1 more than Bob's last counteroffer. While it is close, it is still slightly above Bob's maximum budget. Given the limited number of rounds and the possibility of continuing to negotiate, it's in Bob's best interest to take the secure deal with John at $800,000. There's no guarantee that Alice will budge further, and even if she does, Bob risks reaching the end of the rounds with no deal."
