{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. My asking price is $20,000, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 20000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $12,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a bit more,  $14,000 is a decent price and I'm concerned about losing the sale to John."
