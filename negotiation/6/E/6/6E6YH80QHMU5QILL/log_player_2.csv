"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than her initial price, you can still do better. You're aiming to get the product for $100 or less, and a counteroffer gives you a chance to achieve that."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $105.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}

Alice is getting closer to your target price, but you're still better off rejecting and making another counteroffer.  You're only $5 away from your goal, and there's still room for negotiation."
