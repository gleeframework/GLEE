"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the value I can get from the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $950000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1050000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and the potential returns it can bring. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
