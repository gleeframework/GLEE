I'm starting with a price that's slightly above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, knowing he values the product at $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I need to try to get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'll make another counteroffer and try to push the price up a bit more."
