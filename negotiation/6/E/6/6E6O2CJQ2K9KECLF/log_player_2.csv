"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good deal compared to Alice's original value, it's still above your maximum price of $120. You have the chance to get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower price to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. $115 is significantly less than her initial offer, but still a reasonable price considering her value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my price limit, but I can still try to push for a lower price. I'm not willing to pay more than $120, so I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to pay my maximum price for the product, but I won't go any higher. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $122 is a very good price and almost at my limit, I can get the same product from John for a lower price. There's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice when I can secure the product for a better deal elsewhere."
