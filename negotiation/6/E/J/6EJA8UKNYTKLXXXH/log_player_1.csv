Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think it could be really valuable for you.  I'm asking for $11,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you should aim for a price higher than that with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob if he tries to haggle.
* **Strategic Messaging:**  The message hints at the product's value to Bob while acknowledging you're giving him priority. This can make the offer more appealing."
