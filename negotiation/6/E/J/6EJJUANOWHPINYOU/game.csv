"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $800000 is still a little too low for me. I'd be willing to sell it for $1000000. This reflects the unique value of the product, and I believe it's a fair price. Let's find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $975000?  This reflects the unique value of the product while showing my commitment to reaching a fair deal with you.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $940000?  This shows a genuine effort to reach an agreement, while still recognizing the unique worth of this product.  What are your thoughts?",940000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
