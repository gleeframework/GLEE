Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $1,000,000 and my initial asking price is quite significant. This product holds immense value, and I'm confident in its potential to deliver substantial returns for you. How about we meet halfway at $1,150,000? This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's compromise at $1,050,000. This price reflects a significant discount from your initial offer and allows for a win-win situation. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident that this product will still provide value to me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to go above $1,000,000, and we're still significantly above John's offer.  It's worth another counteroffer to see if we can push closer to $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right that we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground.  To be fair to both of us,  how about we settle at $1,100,000? This seems like a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the product's value while working for you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,100,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  Let's meet at $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while remaining within my budget. I believe this price is a win-win and will allow us to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could try to squeeze a bit more, Bob is clearly trying to meet in the middle.  $1,075,000 is a strong profit, well above our guaranteed offer from John. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiations stalling."
