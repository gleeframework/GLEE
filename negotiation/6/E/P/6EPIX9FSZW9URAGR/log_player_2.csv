"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  While it's within your budget, it's not a good starting point. It's best to counteroffer and see if you can get a better price.  There's still a lot of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $1,000,000 and my initial asking price is quite significant. This product holds immense value, and I'm confident in its potential to deliver substantial returns for you. How about we meet halfway at $1,150,000? This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I want to keep pushing for a lower price. There's still room for negotiation, and I can likely get a better deal by continuing the process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's compromise at $1,050,000. This price reflects a significant discount from your initial offer and allows for a win-win situation. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident that this product will still provide value to me at this price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right that we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground.  To be fair to both of us,  how about we settle at $1,100,000? This seems like a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the product's value while working for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high.  I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. It's worth pushing a bit further before considering buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,100,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  Let's meet at $1,075,000.
