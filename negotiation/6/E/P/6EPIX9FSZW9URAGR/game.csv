"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $1,000,000 and my initial asking price is quite significant. This product holds immense value, and I'm confident in its potential to deliver substantial returns for you. How about we meet halfway at $1,150,000? This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's compromise at $1,050,000. This price reflects a significant discount from your initial offer and allows for a win-win situation. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident that this product will still provide value to me at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're right that we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground.  To be fair to both of us,  how about we settle at $1,100,000? This seems like a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the product's value while working for you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,100,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  Let's meet at $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while remaining within my budget. I believe this price is a win-win and will allow us to finalize the deal.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
