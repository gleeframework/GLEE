Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to me ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Building rapport:**  The message is friendly and expresses a belief that Bob will value the product.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message ends with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That price is a bit high for me though. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for higher price:**  While Bob's initial rejection indicates he values the product less, there's still room for negotiation.
* **John as a safety net:**  Selling to John for $100 is a viable alternative, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $65 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $85? That gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering with justification:** I'm not just rejecting Bob's offer outright. I'm providing a reason (too low) and suggesting a compromise.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  $85 is the midpoint between my initial offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $65. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Focus on fairness:** Emphasizing a ""fair deal"" for both parties can appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to consider the counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer. Would you be willing to do $75? That's a fair price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not close enough:** While Bob's offer of $75 is closer to my minimum of $100, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Time is money:**  Further negotiation could take longer, potentially costing me opportunity. 
* **John's offer is secure:** John provides a guaranteed $100, which is a comfortable profit and a reliable alternative. 
* **Avoiding risk:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer or delaying the sale further. 

I've decided to take the sure thing and sell the product to John. While I'd ideally like a higher price, John's offer is a safe and reasonable option."
