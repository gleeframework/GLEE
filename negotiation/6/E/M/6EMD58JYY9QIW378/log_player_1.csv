{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $100. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential profit for me. 
* **Message:** I'm trying to be friendly and highlight the value of the product for Bob.

**Reasoning:**

This is a starting point. I don't want to start too low and risk leaving money on the table, but I also don't want to scare Bob off with an unreasonable price. By starting at $100, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a price that is closer to my desired $120.  

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will consider the following:

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** If his counteroffer is reasonable, I might accept it. If not, I will make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer:** If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I'll consider selling to John for $120. This will ensure that I don't lose money on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I consider the product to be worth.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my minimum target of $120. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe I can potentially get a higher price from Bob if I continue negotiating.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting Bob's offer would secure a sale, but it would result in a significant loss compared to my desired $120. Rejecting his offer allows me to attempt to maximize my profit.
* **John's Offer as Backup:**  Knowing I have John as a buyer for $120 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get a price closer to my desired $120 while still remaining within a reasonable range for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a great deal on a high-quality product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering a price of $95. This is a compromise, bringing my offer closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a healthy profit margin.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and trying to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation:** This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. It's a good balance between getting closer to Bob's offer and maintaining my desired profit.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** The knowledge of John's offer at $120 gives me the confidence to hold out for a price closer to my desired minimum. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait to see how Bob responds to my counteroffer.  I'll be prepared to negotiate further based on his response, or  accept his offer if he agrees to my counteroffer. If his counteroffer remains too low, I'll ultimately consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is now only $10 away from my minimum target of $120.  Given that John is offering me a price of $120, accepting Bob's offer would mean losing out on $30 in profit. However, continuing to negotiate further may not be worth the time and effort. The risk of Bob rejecting further offers and me having to accept John's offer (which is a sure thing) makes it more attractive to accept Bob's offer.

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimizing Loss:**  While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, accepting Bob's offer still allows me to make a decent profit of $10 over my minimum target. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Bob will reject further offers, leaving me with only John's offer of $120. 
* **Time Efficiency:**  Negotiating further could be time-consuming and might not result in a significantly higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and sell him the product for $90. This ensures I secure a sale and make a reasonable profit."
