"Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need it to be much closer to $80 to make sense for me.",80.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",110.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate you moving on the price, Alice. However, $110 is still pushing my budget. I could go up to $90, but that's the absolute highest I could consider.",90.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm getting closer to your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $90. I can meet you halfway between $90 and $110, which is $100. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",100.0,Alice,5,,
