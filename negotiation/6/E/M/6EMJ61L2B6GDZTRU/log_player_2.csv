"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
 
Alice's starting price is way too high. It's much higher than your limit and even higher than its value to Alice. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need it to be much closer to $80 to make sense for me."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:** Starting with a much lower offer signals that you're serious about getting a good deal and won't easily agree to a price near Alice's initial offer. 
* **Setting the Stage:**  By suggesting $80, you're aiming for a price around $90 after some back and forth. This leaves room for negotiation while staying well below your $100 maximum.
* **Leaving John as Backup:** Remember, you can always buy the product from John for $100 if the negotiations with Alice don't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $110 is still above your budget.  You have some bargaining power because you know John will sell it to you for $100. Let's see if you can get Alice closer to your range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving on the price, Alice. However, $110 is still pushing my budget. I could go up to $90, but that's the absolute highest I could consider."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer shows Alice you're willing to negotiate but are firm on your budget limits. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $90 puts you in a strong position.  
    * If Alice accepts, you've gotten a good deal. 
    * If Alice counters, it's likely to be close to $100, giving you a final decision point.
* **John as Leverage:** Remember, John's offer is your safety net. You don't have to settle for a price you're uncomfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $90. I can meet you halfway between $90 and $110, which is $100. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your bottom line. There's no point in rejecting and trying to negotiate further. You've successfully bargained her down to the same price John is offering, so you might as well buy it from Alice."
