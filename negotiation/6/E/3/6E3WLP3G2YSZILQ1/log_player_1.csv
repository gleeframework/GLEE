Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a great deal, but I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning that you believe the product is ""worth a great deal,"" you're subtly suggesting that the price is justified and piquing Bob's interest.
* **Time Pressure:** The phrase ""before I list it publicly"" creates a subtle sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.

While there's a chance Bob might reject this initial offer, it positions Alice for a potentially higher profit. If he rejects it, she can always fall back on John's guaranteed $100 offer."
