"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to this amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $10,000? This price still allows me to make a profit, and it's closer to your budget. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, I am still unable to go above $8,000 due to my budget constraints. I would like to propose $9,000 as a compromise. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my financial limits.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Given the value of this product, I believe $9,500 is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement.  This price is only $500 more than your last offer and would be a great compromise.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but unfortunately, I cannot agree to $9,500. I would like to propose $9,200 as a compromise, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.",9200.0,Bob,6,
