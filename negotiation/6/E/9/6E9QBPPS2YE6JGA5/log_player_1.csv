Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** This allows you to potentially make a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** It leaves no room for ambiguity.

By starting with this offer, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a final price that is favorable to both of us. However, I also have the option of going to John for $15,000 if Bob is unwilling to meet my needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't accept a price that is so low.  I'll make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $10,000? This price still allows me to make a profit, and it's closer to your budget. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, I am still unable to go above $8,000 due to my budget constraints. I would like to propose $9,000 as a compromise. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I won't settle for a price that is significantly below my desired price point.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Given the value of this product, I believe $9,500 is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement.  This price is only $500 more than your last offer and would be a great compromise."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but unfortunately, I cannot agree to $9,500. I would like to propose $9,200 as a compromise, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $9,200 is getting closer to my desired price, I've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to significantly increase the offer. Given the time and effort already invested in this negotiation, it's now more beneficial to sell the product to John for $15,000. This will ensure I achieve my minimum acceptable price and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
