"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its potential. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit on this sale, and $1000000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1400000.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1100000,  which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I'm confident this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1100000 is enough to justify the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1300000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's true value.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1300000 is still beyond my current budget. I'm willing to go up to $1150000, which reflects a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm confident this is a fair price that allows both of us to achieve our desired outcome.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1450000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
