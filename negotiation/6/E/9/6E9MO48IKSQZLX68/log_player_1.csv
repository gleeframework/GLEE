"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my desired $120.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 just isn't feasible for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? This still gives you a good price, and it gets me closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm offering $90, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to maximize my profit. I'm also reminding Bob that he's getting a good deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $90. I'm still a bit below my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$92 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'd prefer more, I've already rejected Bob's offer twice, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely.  $92 is a reasonable compromise and ensures I don't have to sell to John for less than my desired price."
