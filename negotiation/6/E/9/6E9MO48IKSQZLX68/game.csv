"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 just isn't feasible for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? This still gives you a good price, and it gets me closer to what I need.",90.0,Alice,3,

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $90. I'm still a bit below my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $92?,92.0,Bob,4,
