"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering our respective needs.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $850,000 is quite a ways off from what I had in mind. This product has immense value that I'm confident will benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my price point. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This reflects a genuine attempt to find common ground and reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While Bob is moving in the right direction, it's unlikely he'll reach a price point that makes staying in the negotiation worthwhile. Accepting $950,000 is a significant loss compared to John's offer. It's time to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
