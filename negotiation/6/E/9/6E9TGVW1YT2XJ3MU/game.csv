"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering our respective needs. ",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $850,000 is quite a ways off from what I had in mind. This product has immense value that I'm confident will benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my price point. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This reflects a genuine attempt to find common ground and reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
