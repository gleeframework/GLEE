I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value, but not so high as to scare Bob away immediately.  I'll be ready to negotiate based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I believe I can get a better price. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm dropping the price to $1,300,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some room for potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer is a good compromise. It's above my minimum and worth taking. I'm also concerned about potentially going back and forth with Bob further and risking him walking away completely."
