"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Gauge Bob's Response:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's eagerness and potential for a quick deal versus a longer negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping in mind the guaranteed $1,200,000 offer from John provides a safety net and influences the acceptable range for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is our absolute minimum acceptable price. While we could accept and close the deal now, there's still room for negotiation. We started high, and Bob countered low â€“ a common negotiation tactic.  We'll try to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,340,000.  This reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 1340000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We've lowered our price by $60,000, a significant amount that demonstrates willingness to negotiate.
* **Holding Ground:**  We're still aiming for a price significantly above our minimum. The $1,340,000 offer leaves room for further negotiation while keeping us in a strong position.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""fair price"" reinforces the value proposition and encourages Bob to move closer to our desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,280,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to our range, we're still in a position to negotiate further. He's acknowledging the product's value to him, and we have some leverage with John's standing offer. We'll counter-offer again to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you finding a middle ground.  It seems we're getting closer. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm willing to accept $1,310,000. This is a significant price reduction on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1310000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's last offer and our previous asking price. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Final Offer Tinge:**  By phrasing it as a significant concession and a fair deal, we subtly hint this might be our final move before considering John's offer more seriously.
* **Time Constraint:** We are approaching the halfway point of the rounds, so adding a subtle sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000. This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,300,000 is a significant profit above our minimum and a good deal overall. 
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob's language suggests this is likely his final offer, and pushing further could make him walk away.
* **Time Value:**  While we have more rounds, closing the deal now provides certainty and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or us having to settle for John's offer later."
