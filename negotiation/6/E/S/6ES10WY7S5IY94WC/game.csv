"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,340,000.  This reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring a fair price.",1340000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,280,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",1280000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you finding a middle ground.  It seems we're getting closer. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm willing to accept $1,310,000. This is a significant price reduction on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1310000.0,Alice,5,
