"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,600,000 is far above his maximum budget of $1,000,000. He has plenty of rounds left to negotiate and can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is quite high for my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm aiming for a higher number, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, $1,300,000 is still above Bob's budget. He has several rounds left to negotiate and can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand where you're coming from.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above Bob's budget.  He has several rounds left, but at this point, the negotiations seem to be stalling.  It's better to secure the product from John for $1,000,000 and avoid further potential delays or complications with Alice."
