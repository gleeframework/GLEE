Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts.  Here's why:

* **Profit:** This price nets you a $4,000 profit, which is a good return considering your minimum acceptable price.
* **Attractiveness to Bob:**  While Bob could get the product for less from John, the $1,000 difference is likely small enough that he'll want to avoid the risk of losing out on the product entirely."
