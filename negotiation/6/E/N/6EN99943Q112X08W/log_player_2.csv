"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's still significantly more than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000). 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds, so you have time to try and lower the price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  If the negotiation fails, you can still purchase the product for $1,500,000, which is your maximum limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, considering its value to you and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value to you is worth more than that. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still significantly more than the product's worth to her ($800,000).
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  You have seven rounds remaining.
* **Buying from John is still a fallback option.**  You're not desperate yet, and you have time to try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000.  This reflects a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $850,000, so I'm thinking $875,000. Let's see if we can seal the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still slightly too high.** While it's getting closer, it's still above the product's worth to her ($800,000). 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You have five rounds left. You can try to push for a lower price.
* **Buying from John is still a backup option.** If negotiations fall through, you have that option, but you want to maximize your savings."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $875,000 is closer to my target, I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $860,000. This reflects a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my financial limitations. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 860000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're committed to finding a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $860,000, so I'm thinking $867,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $867,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $867,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your desired price.** It's just slightly above your previous offer of $860,000.
* **You have limited rounds remaining.**  With only 3 rounds left, it's getting risky to continue negotiating, especially since Alice has indicated this is her final offer.
* **Buying from John is significantly more expensive.**  The difference between Alice's offer and John's price is substantial ($632,500), making this offer a much better deal.

While you might be able to squeeze out a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John outweighs the potential savings."
