"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go below $105. Let's meet in the middle, and I'll let you have it for that price.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105, which would be $97.50. Can you consider that?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I can't go any lower than $100. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let's finalise this, and I'll let you have it for $100.",100.0,Alice,5,
