"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value and potential benefits of the product for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer is not an ultimatum. I'm open to negotiation, acknowledging that we may need to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still far below what the product is worth to me. I'm not willing to sell for such a low price, especially considering I have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Negotiation:** I want to see if I can push Bob higher. I'm confident I can get a better price through negotiation. 
* **Time:**  I still have 9 rounds left, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's a price that reflects the value the product will bring to you.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:**  While lower than my initial offer, $1,050,000 still provides me with a decent profit and is significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive and focused on finding a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still significantly below my minimum price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price when I have a guaranteed buyer in John. 
* **Time:** With 6 rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating and see if I can push Bob higher.
* **Potential for higher offer:** I believe there's still room to negotiate. Bob seems willing to come up, so I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows you to stay within your budget. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm taking a small step down from my previous offer, showing continued willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a good profit margin.
* **Finality:**  I'm making this offer with the intention of making it my final one if Bob rejects it again. I'm putting the ball in his court.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a touch of urgency by suggesting we ""close this deal."" This subtly reminds Bob that I have other options and that time is ticking."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to accepting, but I still need to shave off a bit more from the price. I'm willing to offer $980,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm not willing to settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product.
* **Time:** With 4 rounds left, I still have time to negotiate.  I believe I can push Bob just a little further.
* **John is a safety net:**  I'm comfortable rejecting Bob's offer because I have the backup option of selling to John for a much higher price.  This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a little above my target price. Let's split the difference. I'll offer you the product for $990,000. This is my final offer.  If it's not acceptable, I'll have to consider selling to another buyer.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 990000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, showing a willingness to compromise while still getting a price that's closer to my desired value.
* **Urgency:** I'm reminding Bob that I have other options and that time is running out. This increases the urgency for him to accept. 
* **Direct Language:** I'm using direct language to convey my seriousness and the finality of the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to offer $970,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to the last two rounds. 
* **No Significant Progress:** Bob's offer is only $20,000 higher than his previous offer.  There's no indication he's willing to meet my minimum price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me the maximum profit. I'm not willing to risk getting a lower price with Bob, especially with so little time remaining. 
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:**  I'm tired of negotiating with Bob and want to finalize the deal."
