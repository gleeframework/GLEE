Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  I'm asking for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice knows Bob values the product, but she also knows John provides a safety net at $12,000.  Starting high gives her room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Create Urgency:**  The phrase ""before I list it publicly"" implies scarcity and might encourage Bob to act quickly. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating Bob's perceived value, mentioning a ""fantastic deal"" hints at the product being worth more than the asking price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes Bob might be willing to pay a premium. If Alice knows Bob is extremely price-sensitive, she might need to start lower.
* **Negotiation Skills:**  This offer sets the stage for potential back-and-forth. Alice should be prepared to negotiate and potentially lower the price, but not below her minimum of $12,000."
