"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is within his budget, it's still a significant amount. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds remaining, giving Bob ample opportunity to try and reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $150,000. This shows Alice he's serious about negotiating a better price.  The $950,000 offer is still significantly higher than Alice's valuation, giving her room to compromise, while still leaving Bob with substantial savings compared to the original offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her offer, it's still not as low as Bob's counteroffer. Bob still has time and leverage in this negotiation, making rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate the best option. There are still 7 rounds left, and Bob can likely get a lower price than $1,050,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of incremental negotiation. He increases his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better price. This $975,000 counteroffer is closer to Alice's likely acceptable range, increasing the chances of a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice has lowered her offer again, Bob is still holding out for a better deal. He has already successfully pushed the price down and has 5 rounds remaining. It's likely that Alice will continue to lower her price, so it's worth continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's likely acceptable price. By offering $1,000,000, he's showing a willingness to meet halfway, while still maintaining a significant saving compared to the initial offer.  This offer creates a win-win scenario, as it's within Alice's acceptable range and still leaves Bob with a significant amount of money saved. This also leaves Alice with only one round to counteroffer before Bob can resort to buying from John."
