"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,380,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,390,000?",1390000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit above the original offer. I'm willing to go slightly lower, to $1,370,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1370000.0,Bob,4,
