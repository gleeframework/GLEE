"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $100 by you. Considering its worth and the quality it offers, I would like to propose a price of $120 for you to consider.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the pitch. However, I'm on a tight budget and $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80? I think that's fair given my budget.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your feedback. To find a middle ground, I would like to propose a price of $95 for the product. This is higher than your offer but still within a reasonable range considering the value it provides. I hope this proposal works for you.",95.0,Alice,3,
