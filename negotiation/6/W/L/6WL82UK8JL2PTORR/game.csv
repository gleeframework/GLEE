"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving towards a compromise, Alice. How about we settle at $11,500? That feels like a fair deal to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to your target price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $12,500, and that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
