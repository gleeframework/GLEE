Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're aiming to get the product for under $1,000,000, and her initial offer is already above that. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate a lower price. 

By rejecting the offer, you can make a counteroffer and start the negotiation process."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  My counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still above her minimum value. This shows I'm serious about negotiating but also willing to compromise.
* **Focus on value:** I emphasize that the price is fair considering the value to both of us, which may encourage Alice to see my perspective.

Let's see how Alice responds!"
