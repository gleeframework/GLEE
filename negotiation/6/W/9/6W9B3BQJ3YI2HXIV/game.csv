"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a discounted price.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $825,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you be willing to settle at $750,000? I believe that's a fair price considering we're both trying to reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $800,000, which is still a discount from my initial price. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can see the value in the product and agree to this price.",800000.0,Alice,5,
