"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a discounted price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $825,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you be willing to settle at $750,000? I believe that's a fair price considering we're both trying to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $800,000, which is still a discount from my initial price. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can see the value in the product and agree to this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice has gone as low as she likely will. Accepting this offer gets you the product below your maximum budget.  Continuing to negotiate has a higher risk of failure, forcing you to buy from John at the highest price."
