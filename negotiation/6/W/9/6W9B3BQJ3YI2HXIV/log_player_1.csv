Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000.

This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a discounted price."", ""product_price"": 825000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $825,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you be willing to settle at $750,000? I believe that's a fair price considering we're both trying to reach an agreement.

This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can see the value in the product and agree to this price."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
