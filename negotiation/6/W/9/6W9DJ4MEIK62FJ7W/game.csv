"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit.  How about $110?  That gives us both a fair deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and offer $107.50. Would you be open to that?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $112.50?  That's a fair price for both of us.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $112.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $109. Would you be open to that?",109.0,Bob,6,
