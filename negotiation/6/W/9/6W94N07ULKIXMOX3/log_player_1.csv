Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'm selling, and I think you'd be very interested. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Highlighting the product's value (even without specifics) can entice Bob to think about its worth to him. 

This initial offer sets the stage for a negotiation where I can potentially get closer to my desired price while still leaving room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8500? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** I want to maximize my earnings.  While $8,500 is better than $8,000 (John's offer), I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates I'm not desperate to sell and I'm willing to negotiate further.  This will hopefully pressure Bob to come closer to my price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still above $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows you to stay within your budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:**  Offering a price halfway between my last offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($8,500) signals a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Value and Budget:** I re-emphasize the product's value and acknowledge Bob's budget constraints, showing I'm trying to find a solution that works for both of us. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly tone encourages continued negotiation.

This counteroffer demonstrates my commitment to the negotiation while also pushing for a price that's more favorable to me."
