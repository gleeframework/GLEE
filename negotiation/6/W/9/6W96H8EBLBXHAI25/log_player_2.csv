Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  To be transparent, $1,050,000 is a bit too far from what I had in mind.  Let's aim for a win-win scenario. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price considering the product's significant value to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
