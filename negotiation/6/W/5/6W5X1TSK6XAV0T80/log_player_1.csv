Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable, for $140. It's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $150, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($100).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($10 saved). 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John, aiming higher with Bob first gives you the chance to earn more."
