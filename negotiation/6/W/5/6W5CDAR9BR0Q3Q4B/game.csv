"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $8000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can offer you a compromise at $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we meet in the middle at $9500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $10800. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise.",10800.0,Alice,5,
