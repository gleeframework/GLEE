{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This offer starts by building a positive relationship with Bob, highlighting the value of the product for him. The price is set at $120, which is significantly higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob and gives you a good starting point for a profitable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still significantly below my desired price point.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a price closer to my ideal $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than selling to John and close to my desired price point. Accepting the offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids further negotiation."
