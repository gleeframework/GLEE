"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's but still too high for Bob.** Bob's goal is to pay as little as possible, and $11,500 is still above his target of $12,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** Alice is willing to sell for less than $12,000, and Bob is willing to pay more than $10,000. This means there's a potential price range where both parties can benefit.

By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within Bob's budget:** $11,000 is still within Bob's maximum price limit of $12,000.
* **It's a significant reduction:**  $11,000 is a $500 reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's seriousness in negotiation.
* **It's still above Alice's value:** $11,000 is above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $10,000, leaving room for compromise. 

This counteroffer sets a strong starting point for further negotiation, aiming for a deal that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $11,250 is still within Bob's maximum price limit of $12,000.
* **It's a good compromise:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, and Bob has saved $250 compared to his initial counteroffer. 
* **Further negotiation might be time-consuming:** While Bob could continue to try and get a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or that the negotiation will become drawn-out. 

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob secures a good deal within his budget and avoids the potential for further negotiation complications."
