Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming to get more than your $10,000 minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's space for him to counteroffer without immediately hitting your minimum. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  A price slightly higher than halfway between your minimum and Bob's valuation shows you're serious about getting a good deal.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still in a good position to negotiate further.  There's still a $1,000 difference between his offer and my desired price.  I'll try to meet him in the middle with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway on his last offer.  This shows I'm willing to be flexible, but I still want to get a good price for the product."
