,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is my maximum.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $18,000. This is a compromise, reflecting the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer.  $18,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000,  but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the product's value warrants a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept.",15000.0,Alice,5,
