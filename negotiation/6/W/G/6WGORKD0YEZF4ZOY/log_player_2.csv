"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I believe a price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worthwhile to try negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $12,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counter-offer:**  This shows Alice you're serious about negotiation but also sets a firm starting point.
* **Be polite and direct:** Maintaining a good relationship is important, but be clear about your financial limitations.
* **Leave room for compromise:** $12,000 is still above your ideal price, but it allows for some wiggle room during the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $22,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $17,000 is still above your maximum budget of $10,000. You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  It's important to stick to your budget and not get pressured by Alice's ""meet you halfway"" statement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $12,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we've both discussed.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stick to your price:** You've already established $12,000 as your limit. Reinforcing this strengthens your position.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  By framing it as a ""fair price"" based on the value both of you see, you appeal to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Show willingness to compromise:**  The phrase ""Let's see if we can make this work"" signals a willingness to find common ground.  

This approach keeps the pressure on Alice while leaving room for a potential compromise in the coming rounds."
