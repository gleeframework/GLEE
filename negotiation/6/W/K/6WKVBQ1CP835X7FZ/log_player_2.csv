"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. Given its features and potential, I'm asking for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to negotiate a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $650,000."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

This counter-offer accomplishes a few things:

* **Polite and Professional:** It maintains a positive tone, important for successful negotiation.
* **Significant Counter:**  The initial offer was $1,200,000.  By countering at $650,000, I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate but aiming for a price well below Alice's starting point. 
* **Leaves Room for Movement:** I'm prepared to go higher, but this strong initial counter puts the pressure on Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could you do $950,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $950,000 is still too high. I need to hold firm and encourage her to move closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. To be frank, I'm targeting a price closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in that range?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Direct but Respectful:** I'm being more direct about my budget limitations while maintaining a professional tone. 
* **Slight Increase:**  Increasing my offer to $700,000 shows some movement on my side but still keeps me well below her ask. 
* **Putting the Ball in Her Court:** By suggesting a ""range"" around $700,000, I'm encouraging her to make the next move and hopefully come down significantly."
