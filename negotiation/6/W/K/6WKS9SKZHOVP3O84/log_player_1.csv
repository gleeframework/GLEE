Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $9,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving space for bargaining:** I'm offering $9,000, giving Bob some space to counter-offer without making me feel like I'm losing out immediately. 
* **Showing confidence:**  A higher initial offer demonstrates confidence in the product's value and helps set the tone for a negotiation.

**Remember:**  I can always lower my price if necessary, but it's best to start strong and work your way down.  If Bob rejects my initial offer, I'll assess his counter-offer and decide whether to accept, counter-offer again, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my minimum. 
* **Selling to John is still an option:** If the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory result, I can still sell to John for $8,000.

I will proceed to the next round and counter-offer Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $7,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $8,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer of $8,500 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my desired price and Bob's offer.
* **Showing flexibility:** This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and reach a fair price.
* **Maintaining a reasonable margin:**  $8,500 is still above my minimum price, ensuring I get a good deal.

If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I will have to decide whether to lower my price further or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested, but $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  That way, we both get a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $8,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  While I could try to negotiate a bit higher, it's likely Bob won't budge much further.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing him as a buyer altogether. 
* **Good deal:**  $8,250 is a good deal for me, considering I can always sell to John for $8,000 if this deal falls through.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that's almost at my target price and minimizes the risk of losing a buyer."
