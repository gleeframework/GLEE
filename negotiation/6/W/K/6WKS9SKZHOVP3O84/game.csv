"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $9,000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $7,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $8,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  That way, we both get a fair deal.",8250.0,Bob,4,
