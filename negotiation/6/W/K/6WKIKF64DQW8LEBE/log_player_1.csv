Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it offers significant value, and this price reflects its worth in the current market."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher than that with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $19,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might try to haggle, and you can always come down slightly while still staying above your minimum.
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the product's value and market conditions can help justify the higher price to Bob. 

**Important Note:** While you know Bob's perceived value is $10,000, he doesn't know you have another buyer.  Don't anchor your offer too close to his perceived value, or you'll limit your potential profit."
