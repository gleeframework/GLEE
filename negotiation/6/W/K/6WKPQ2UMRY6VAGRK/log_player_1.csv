Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'll reject Bob's offer. $70 is too low, and I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $85? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 85}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $77.5 is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. However, $77.50 is still a bit below what I need. Let's try $82.50. It's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $79.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, I'm running out of time and $79.50 is still slightly lower than what John is offering. It's time to secure the deal with John and get my desired price."
