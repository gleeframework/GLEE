"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm prepared to come down to $10,000, which is still a great price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $9,500 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,750? I believe this is a fair price that benefits us both.",9750.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $9,600, but no higher. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9600.0,Bob,6,
