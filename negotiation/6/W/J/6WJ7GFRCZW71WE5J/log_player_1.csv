"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation. I'm also trying to be friendly and positive in my message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $95? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! However, $95 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I could continue to negotiate, I've already gone through a few rounds and I'm concerned I might not be able to get to a price I'm happy with. Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. This ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoids further potential negotiation with Bob."
