Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also leaving room for negotiation, but I won't go below my minimum of $12,000.  If Bob rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide if I want to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, so I'll accept it.  It's not ideal, but it guarantees a sale and avoids further negotiation."
