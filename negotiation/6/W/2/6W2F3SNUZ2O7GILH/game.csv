"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $950,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $700,000. Can you meet me halfway?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I understand your position, $700,000 is unfortunately far too low for me.  The value this product brings to your business is significant, and I'm confident we can find a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, reflecting a substantial discount from my initial offer.  This price reflects the significant value you'll gain.  Let's continue the conversation and find a solution that benefits both parties.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm going to counteroffer at $825,000. Can you consider this price?",825000.0,Bob,4,
