"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's an extraordinary opportunity that could significantly enhance your business operations. I believe its value to you is well above my asking price. Let's discuss how we can make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than her stated value of $1,000,000. This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer, potentially securing a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm going to need to come in lower. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate.  
* **Strategic Consideration:** This offer is still within Bob's budget and is above Alice's stated value, leaving room for further negotiation while giving her a reason to consider. 
* **Building a Relationship:** The message acknowledges Alice's enthusiasm and emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable price, creating a more collaborative tone for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Considering the value you see in our product, I am willing to consider a price closer to your offer. Therefore, I am proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and budget.
