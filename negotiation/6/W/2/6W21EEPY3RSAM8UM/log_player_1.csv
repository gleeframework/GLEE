Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $115 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate or counteroffer, while still ensuring a significant gain if he accepts immediately.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John gives me leverage. I won't accept any offers below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're selling. I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my fallback price with John, I know the product is worth $120 to him. There's still room for negotiation to secure a better deal. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $108?"", 
""product_price"": 108
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $108 is still a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm avoiding a large drop from my initial offer, signaling that I believe in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Let's try $105 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:**  $105 is a good profit margin above my minimum ($100).
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further negotiation might only yield small increments, and there's a risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations."
