You can do better than $12,000. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if you can get a lower price."

Alice's offer:

You're still saving money by rejecting Alice's offer and countering. You can likely get the price even lower."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $12,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.

While you might be able to squeeze out a bit more, at this point it's likely Alice is firm on her price.  You're saving $2,750 compared to buying from John, which is a significant amount.  Accepting the offer is the best choice at this point."
