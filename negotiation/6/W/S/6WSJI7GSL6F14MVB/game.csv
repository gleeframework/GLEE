"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer. I'm looking for $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking to invest a bit less initially. Would you be willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product?  I believe this price reflects the value we both see in this investment, and allows for a smooth and mutually beneficial transaction. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This price still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges your willingness to invest in it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference -  I'm offering $1,025,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to move forward with the transaction. ",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to reach a fair price, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the $1,025,000 offer. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This price is closer to your original offer, but still reflects the product's value to me.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  Let's try to bridge the gap once more. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while still allowing us to reach an agreement.  I hope we can find common ground at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1,070,000. This price is closer to your original offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1070000.0,Alice,7,
