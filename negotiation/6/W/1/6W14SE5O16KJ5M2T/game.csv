"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is truly exceptional and in a league of its own.  I can adjust my previous offer slightly, and propose a price of $2,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the product's worth and potential.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  However, we're still quite a ways apart.  To be frank, I can find similar products for closer to $1,500,000. If you're able to come down to $1,300,000, I think we have a deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but comparing this product to others at the $1,500,000 mark is like comparing a masterpiece painting to a simple sketch.  The inherent value and long-term potential of this product are significantly greater. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,900,000. This offer takes into account our discussions while still reflecting the true worth of what's on the table.",1900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you explaining the value further.  However, I have a strict budget I need to adhere to. I can't go any higher than $1,400,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your budget constraints, but I also have to be mindful of the value I'm offering. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,700,000? This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and ensures you're still getting an incredible deal on a truly exceptional product.",1700000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I understand this product is valuable to you, but I'm really at my limit.  Would you consider $1,450,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",1450000.0,Bob,8,
