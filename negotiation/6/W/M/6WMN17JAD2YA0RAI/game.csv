"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,800 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $10,200. Can you consider that?",10200.0,Bob,4,
