Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:** It's always good to start the negotiation with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($80). This gives you room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Offering $120 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, and for you to potentially meet in the middle while still staying above your desired profit. 
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  The initial offer will help you understand how interested Bob is in the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 

Remember, you have John as a backup buyer at $80, so you're not under pressure to accept an offer below your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I am only able to pay up to $80 for it. Would you be willing to accommodate this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob immediately offering your minimum suggests he might be willing to go slightly higher.  Rejecting his offer opens the door for a counter-offer where you can try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility:** By coming down from $120 to $100, you demonstrate willingness to negotiate.
* **Aim for a middle ground:** This counter-offer is exactly halfway between your initial ask and Bob's offer, making it a fair and potentially appealing compromise. 
* **Maintain a profitable position:** $100 still provides a $20 profit margin, which is a good outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am still unable to meet you at $100. I would like to stick to my original offer of $80 if possible. Is there any way we could reach an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is firm:** Bob has now countered twice with the same $80 offer, indicating he is unlikely to go any higher.
* **Time cost of negotiation:** Further negotiation rounds take time and effort, with no guarantee of a better outcome. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Accepting $80 meets your minimum acceptable price and guarantees a profit.

While you could try for a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob walking away and the time cost of further negotiation make accepting $80 the most sensible option at this point."
