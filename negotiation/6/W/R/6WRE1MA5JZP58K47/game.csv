"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible opportunity to acquire a product that could be a game-changer for your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to you. My initial price is $1500000. Let's discuss this further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your position, $1200000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1350000.  This price reflects the significant value I believe this product holds, and I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1350000, so how about $1275000? I think that's a fair price for the product.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
