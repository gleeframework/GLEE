{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a valuable product that I know would be of great interest to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and represents a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, Bob's higher valuation allows me to aim higher. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,350,000 is strategically placed:
    * It's significantly below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000), making it attractive to him.
    * It's well above my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), maximizing my potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is my initial offer, the message leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 

This approach balances risk and reward, aiming for the best possible outcome while having the security of a backup buyer."
