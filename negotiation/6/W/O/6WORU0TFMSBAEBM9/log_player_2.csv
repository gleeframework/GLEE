Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get at least $150 for this product. That's my bottom line.  Does that work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has revealed that her absolute lowest price is $150.  This is above your maximum budget of $120. There's no point in continuing the negotiation. You can get the product for a guaranteed $120 from John, which is a better deal."
