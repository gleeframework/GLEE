"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though! I can offer it to you for $8250. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8250 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a lower offer. How about $7000? I'm really interested in the product, and I think it's worth it to me at that price.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go down to $7000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment, though. I can offer it to you for $8000 minus a small discount. How about $7800? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",7800.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a slight adjustment, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about $7500? I'm really interested in the product, and I think it's worth it to me at that price.",7500.0,Bob,6,
