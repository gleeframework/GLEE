"Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $16,000 for this product, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",16000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $18,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $17,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.",17000.0,Bob,4,
