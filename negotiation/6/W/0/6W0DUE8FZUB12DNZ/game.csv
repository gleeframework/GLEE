"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  That's still a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $8,000.  Let's find a middle ground and make this happen.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  This feels like a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
