"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you be willing to come down a bit on the price?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower offer ($80) to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This is a common tactic in negotiation, as it leaves room for me to potentially meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm still looking to make a good profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price I'm happy with. Let's counter again and see if we can get closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we split the difference between my previous offer and your current one? Would $87.50 work for you?"",
""product_price"": 87.5
}
```

We're aiming for a compromise here. By suggesting a price directly in the middle, it shows Alice we're willing to negotiate but also standing our ground on getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll meet you at $92, and that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and while it's not the $87.50 I was hoping for, it's still a decent deal compared to John's $100 price. It's better to accept now and secure the savings rather than risk losing the deal entirely."
