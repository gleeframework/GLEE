"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $9,500 feels fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiations, as it's closer to Alice's value of the product.  Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible, but he's also showing his willingness to compromise and move forward with the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I had a higher price in mind, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, her counteroffer is still too high for Bob. He's looking to save as much as possible, and $9,000 is still further from his ideal price than Alice's value. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $8,750?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to meet Alice halfway. It's a good compromise, demonstrating his desire to reach an agreement while still trying to save money.  $8,750 is close to Alice's value, making this offer more likely to be accepted."
