Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a reasonable offer. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $900,000}

This is a 10% discount from the product's true value to Bob, which is $1,000,000. I'm hoping Bob will find this offer attractive and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'm hoping to get a better price for the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer. Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": $850,000}

This is a 5% discount from the product's true value to Bob, which is $1,000,000. I'm hoping Bob will find this offer more appealing than his original offer of $800,000."
