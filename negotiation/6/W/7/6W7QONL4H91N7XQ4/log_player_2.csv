"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than her product's worth to her, you know you can get a better deal from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can purchase the product for $1,000,000 from John, saving yourself $100,000."
