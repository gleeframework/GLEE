"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $850,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's value. I'm thinking $975,000 is a fair price. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you have a firm limit, Bob. I'm willing to make one final push to meet you in the middle. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000, which is $25,000 above your limit. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",950000.0,Alice,7,
