``` 

I'm starting with a price a bit higher than my minimum, knowing that I can always go lower if needed. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is interested and how he reacts to the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider something closer to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too low for me. I'm not willing to sell for less than $150. I will make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $125 is closer, I'm still hoping to stay under $100. Could you do $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'm not willing to accept anything less than $100 right now. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. How about $105? This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
