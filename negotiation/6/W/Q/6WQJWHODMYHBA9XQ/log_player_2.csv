Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $125, but that's as low as I can go.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $125.  While we could try another counter-offer, we risk her walking away, forcing us to buy from John at $150. Accepting $125 secures the product at a reasonable price."
