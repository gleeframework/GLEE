"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,200,000.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000.  This reflects the value of the product to you while still allowing me to achieve a fair price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value to both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $1,400,000 is a good offer, but I'm still a little hesitant. How about we settle on $1,450,000? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us. It's a small step closer to your offer, and I'm confident it will be a good deal for you.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting close to my limit. I'd be willing to go up to $1,425,000, but that's my final offer. I believe this is a fair compromise.  If it doesn't work, I may have to explore other options.",1425000.0,Bob,6,
