Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  To be fair, the product's value is quite high, and $1,400,000 wouldn't be doing it justice. How about we meet halfway at $1,600,000? This would represent a significant discount from my initial offer and still be a win for both of us.
