"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  I'm prepared to accept $1,300,000 for the product.  This still represents a great value for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high. I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price, as it's very close to my maximum budget. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
