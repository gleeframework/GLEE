"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high. You are aiming to save money, and $1,400,000 is above your maximum budget. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  I'm prepared to accept $1,300,000 for the product.  This still represents a great value for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still too high. You can still try to negotiate a lower price, as you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000. It's not worth buying from John yet, as you might be able to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high. I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price, as it's very close to my maximum budget. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
