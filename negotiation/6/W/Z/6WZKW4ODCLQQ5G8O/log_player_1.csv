Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant amount above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and ensures that I get a good return on my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is a decent amount, it's still lower than what I'm aiming for.  I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully it will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd ideally get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is still a good deal. It's above my minimum of $800,000 and represents a decent profit.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially result in a lower price or even no sale at all."
