Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth at least $1,400,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with an offer of $1,400,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to entice Bob. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects, I can make a counteroffer closer to his perceived value of $1,500,000.

**Important Note:**  This is just the first step in a potential negotiation. I'll need to be flexible and adapt my strategy based on Bob's responses. I'll also need to consider John's offer of $1,200,000 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1250000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $1,250,000 is above my absolute minimum, it's still significantly below my initial offer and leaves very little room for profit.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe Bob's offer reflects a willingness to negotiate. I'm confident I can secure a price closer to my initial $1,400,000 or even higher.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer that bridges the gap between our positions and encourages further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,350,000. This counteroffer shows flexibility while still leaving me with a substantial profit. 
* I'll carefully monitor Bob's responses and be ready to adjust my strategy if necessary. 
* The offer from John serves as a fallback option, but I'm determined to maximize my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be a bit closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the true value of the product and allows us to make a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer of $1,400,000 and Bob's offer of $1,250,000. This shows flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasizing Value:** The message reiterates the product's value to justify the price.
* **Creating Urgency:** The phrase ""allows us to make a deal"" subtly suggests that this might be my final offer, putting a bit of pressure on Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely observe Bob's response to this counteroffer. He might accept, counter again, or reject. If he rejects, I will need to weigh the potential benefits of further negotiation with the risk of losing him as a buyer and potentially having to accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1300000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my Target:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is very close to my target price of $1,350,000, and well above my minimum of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for Delay:** If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I might be forced to sell to John at a lower price.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  This offer ensures a significant profit and minimizes the risk of losing out entirely. 

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most rational decision in this situation. It secures a good price and avoids the uncertainties of further negotiation."
