Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $18,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $15,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth and is a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but $15,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
At this point, Bob is offering $11,000 which is a $1,000 profit from your minimum acceptable price and only $1,000 less than your guaranteed sale to John. It's unlikely Bob will go higher and you risk him dropping out of the negotiation altogether if you counter. Take the $11,000.
