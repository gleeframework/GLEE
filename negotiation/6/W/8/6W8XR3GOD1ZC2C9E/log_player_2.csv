"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. This product is worth more than $8000 to me, but I'm willing to start our negotiation at $10000. Let's discuss how we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's initial offer is your maximum price, it's unlikely she'll be willing to sell at that price.  By rejecting, you signal that you are willing to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
