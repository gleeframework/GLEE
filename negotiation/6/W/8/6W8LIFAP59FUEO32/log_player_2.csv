"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can attempt to get a lower price and save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, but also wants to avoid pushing Alice away. A $100,000 reduction is a reasonable starting point, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate seriously while still leaving room for potential further concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a much better price. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price without risking further delays or potential deadlocks."
