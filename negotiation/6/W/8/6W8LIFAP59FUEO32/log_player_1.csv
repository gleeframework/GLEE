Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price as close to Bob's value of $1,200,000 as possible, while still ensuring I get a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still below my target. I believe I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm increasing the price slightly to $950,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product highly.  Hopefully, this is close enough to Bob's value to incentivize him to accept."
