"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. I'm willing to pay a premium for a high-quality item, but I'm also trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. Considering the value I place on it, I'm unable to accept $75. My next offer is $80. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",80.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $80. Can you consider $77.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision today if we can come to an agreement.",77.5,Bob,4,
