"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  This price still gives you a good value, and it's a fair compromise for me. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that we're getting closer, but I'm still a bit shy of $12,500. How about we meet in the middle at $11,200?",11200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close, but $11,200 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down a little further, to $12,000. This is my final offer. I believe it's fair to both of us, and I hope you'll accept it. ",12000.0,Alice,5,
