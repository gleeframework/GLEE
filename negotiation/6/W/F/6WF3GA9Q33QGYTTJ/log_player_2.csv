"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a competitive price. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. My initial offer is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get the product for a much lower price than $1,000,000. Alice's minimum selling price is $800,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,075,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It's better to continue negotiating, trying to get a price closer to Bob's target. There's still room for Alice to lower her price, and Bob can offer a price closer to $850,000 in the next round."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1,025,000, which is a bit higher than your last offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her previous offer, it's still above Bob's target price. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should aim for a price closer to $950,000. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $987,500, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to make it more appealing. How about we meet at $1,012,500, and I'll throw in some additional support and services that will enhance the product's value? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,012,500 is getting closer to Bob's target price and is significantly lower than John's offer.  The added support and services can be valuable to Bob, making it a good deal overall. It's likely that further negotiation won't yield a much better price, so it's a reasonable point to accept the offer."
