"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product significantly exceeds $900,000, especially considering the benefits it offers.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
