Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, his counter-offers are not moving fast enough. It's unlikely we'll bridge the gap to a satisfactory price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is the safest option at this point to ensure we get a fair value for the product."
