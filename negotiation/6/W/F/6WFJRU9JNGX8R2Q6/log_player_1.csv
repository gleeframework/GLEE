"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000. I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you can't go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $12,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close.  I appreciate you working with me.  Could you do $12,000?  I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum price, and I'm running out of time. It's better to accept his offer now than risk losing him entirely and having to sell to John for the same price."
