"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too close to our maximum price. We have room to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still above her valuation. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while aiming for a good deal.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is polite to maintain a positive negotiation environment but also direct in expressing that the initial offer was too high."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $70 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $87. I believe this product will be very beneficial for you and it's a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved a bit from her initial offer, but we still have some negotiating room. While $87 is a tempting price, we can try to push for a slightly better deal before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $78?"",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer suggests a compromise by meeting Alice halfway between her last offer ($87) and our previous counteroffer ($70). 
* **Testing the Waters:** This price point allows us to gauge Alice's flexibility and see if she's willing to move closer to our desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you clearly see the value in this product. I'm happy to negotiate, but I need to stay closer to my original price. How about $83? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $83. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $83
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to anchor the negotiation closer to her initial price. However, $83 is still above our target price. We'll continue to negotiate, but we need to show Alice we're willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on the price, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I can do $80, which is a fair offer considering your initial price and my valuation of the product.  If we can't agree on this, I might have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're holding our ground at $80, which is already pushing our maximum budget. The message is firm but fair, acknowledging Alice's position while also stating our limits.
* **Introducing Alternatives:**  By mentioning ""other options,"" we subtly remind Alice of John's offer. This introduces a mild sense of urgency and competition without being overly aggressive. 
* **Final Push:** This counteroffer is likely our best shot at getting the lowest price from Alice. If she rejects this, we'll need to seriously consider taking John's offer to avoid overpaying."
