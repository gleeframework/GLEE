Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $120. I believe it's something you'll find valuable."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate a bit, but still ensures a significant profit above our minimum. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80 gives us leverage to aim higher with Bob."
