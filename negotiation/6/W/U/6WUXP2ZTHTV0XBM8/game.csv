"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better offer elsewhere.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks again for working with me. $14,500 is getting closer, but I'm trying to stay closer to $13,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $13,750?",13750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to $13,000, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,500 and $13,750, which is $14,125. This is still a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better offer elsewhere.",14125.0,Alice,7,
