"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I can see you're a serious buyer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. Let's see if we can shake on a deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,250,000 is closer, but it's still a bit more than I can manage right now.  I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1,225,000 is a bit short of that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,225,000, so I'm counteroffering at $1,237,500. Let's see if we can seal the deal.",1237500.0,Alice,5,
