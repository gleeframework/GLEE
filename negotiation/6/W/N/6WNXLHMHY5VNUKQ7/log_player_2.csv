"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,300,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While $1,300,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still above Bob's maximum. He has room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I can see you're a serious buyer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. Let's see if we can shake on a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $1,250,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he can still try to negotiate further. He could potentially get closer to his goal of $1,200,000, especially since Alice has already moved from her initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,250,000 is closer, but it's still a bit more than I can manage right now.  I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1,225,000 is a bit short of that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,225,000, so I'm counteroffering at $1,237,500. Let's see if we can seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,237,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,237,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice's offer of $1,237,500 is closer to his desired price, it's still above his budget and leaves very little room for further negotiation.  John offers a price that is within Bob's budget and saves him time and effort in continuing the negotiation."
