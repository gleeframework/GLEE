I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."

{""product_price"": 12500}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $11,500. This is a further concession, but I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob at this price, but I'm also aware that I'm nearing the point where I might be better off selling to John for $12,000."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell to John.  While I'd like to get a bit more from Bob, the negotiations have become increasingly difficult, and I'm concerned that I might not be able to close the deal with him.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, and it's the safest option at this point."
