Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong offer that still leaves me with a substantial gain. It's less likely Bob will find a better deal elsewhere.
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob immediately avoids potential delays involved with John.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations beyond his product valuation."
