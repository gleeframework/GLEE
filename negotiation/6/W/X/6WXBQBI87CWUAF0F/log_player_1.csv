Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefit you'll gain from it."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to get as much profit as possible from Bob, who values the product significantly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A starting price of $1,300,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down, while still ensuring you get significantly more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight Value:**  Framing the offer around the product's unique value to Bob makes it more appealing than just stating a price.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's negotiation style.  If he's known to be very price-sensitive, you might start lower. 
* Be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet a price that's acceptable to you. You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000."
