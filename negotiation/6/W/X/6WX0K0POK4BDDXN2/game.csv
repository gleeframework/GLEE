"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, however,  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I must respectfully decline the $1,600,000 offer. My budget allows me to consider a maximum of $1,400,000 for this product. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
