Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $13,000 is better than my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my initial offer.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm offering $14,000. It's a compromise from my original offer and still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,050
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,050 is only slightly higher than his previous offer, and it's getting closer to my desired price. At this point, it's likely that further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price. It's better to secure a sale at a price that's still good for me."
