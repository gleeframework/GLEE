``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is not terrible, it's still above your maximum budget. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $820,000 is still a bit high, but it's getting closer to your maximum budget.  It's worth another round of negotiation to see if you can get closer to $800,000."
