"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $780000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's make this deal work!",780000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $780000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $820000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",820000.0,Alice,3,
