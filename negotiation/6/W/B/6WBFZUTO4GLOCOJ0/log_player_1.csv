"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,800,000 is below what I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? I think this is a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers, but I think this is the maximum I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to the $1.8 million mark. I'm willing to push a little further to see if I can get him closer to $1,850,000 before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we settle this right now at $1,850,000?  This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that this is your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one more counteroffer of $1,750,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher and we're getting very close to my walk-away point. Accepting $1,750,000 ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
