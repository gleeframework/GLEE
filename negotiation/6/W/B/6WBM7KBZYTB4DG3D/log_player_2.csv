Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal. How about we settle at $800,000?  This is my final offer.

Alice has met your upper limit and it's unlikely she'll go any lower.  You can try a lower offer in the next round but there is a risk she won't budge. Taking the deal now guarantees you get the product at your maximum price."
