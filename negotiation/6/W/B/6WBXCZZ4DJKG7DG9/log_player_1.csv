Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This price is a good starting point, as it's below Bob's perceived value of $150, but still leaves me with a profit above my minimum of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and sell the product, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I will counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a profit of $20. It's also significantly higher than Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum price. It's not ideal, but selling to him for $110 is better than getting $100 from John or potentially getting stuck in further negotiations that might not lead to a better outcome."
