"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject the offer and counter-offer Alice. You can likely get a better price than $12,000, and you're still significantly below your maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but it's still within your budget and hopefully appealing enough for Alice to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is still above your ideal price, it's closer to your limit and likely a better deal than going through more rounds of negotiation. You can always try to find a better deal later, but this offer presents a reasonable compromise."
