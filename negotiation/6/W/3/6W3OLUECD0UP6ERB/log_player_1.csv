Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $90 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $90 is a good starting point. It's a significant markup from my minimum price, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This price will gauge Bob's interest and how willing he is to pay.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** If Bob counters, I can adjust my offer without going below my minimum.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $80 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. However, I am looking to spend no more than $85 on the product. Would you be willing to adjust your price accordingly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:**  $85 is only $5 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee he'll come back with a higher offer, and I risk losing him entirely.
* **Risk of John:**  While selling to John for $80 is a guaranteed outcome, I'm confident that I can negotiate with Bob to get a better price than that.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale that's almost at my minimum acceptable price. I'm also keeping the door open for future negotiations with Bob if he's willing to pay more."
