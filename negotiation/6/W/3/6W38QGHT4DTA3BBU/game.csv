"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $15,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000.
