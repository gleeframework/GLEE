Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize the value you see in it, the product's true worth is reflected in its potential, which justifies a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1450000

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,450,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

We're getting closer, but we're still leaving money on the table. Bob is clearly engaged and showing willingness to negotiate. Let's keep the conversation going."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go a bit further and offer $1,250,000. Can you meet me at this point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,250,000 is a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating serious interest.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to push for a higher price risks losing the deal altogether. Bob might walk away, leaving you with John's offer as the only option. 

Accepting $1,250,000 secures a great outcome at this stage of the negotiation."
