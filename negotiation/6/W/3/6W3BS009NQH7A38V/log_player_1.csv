Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. This creates a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, encouraging him to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While I could sell to John for $150, I still have room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Negotiation is key:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable outcome for myself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $145? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer and proposing a new price, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $145 is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Reinforcement:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and tries to frame the price as an investment, not just an expense."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.
* **Time is money:**  Negotiating further with Bob risks losing valuable time.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit of $150. 

At this point, I'm  comfortable with the guaranteed profit from John, as the potential for a higher price from Bob isn't worth the risk of further negotiation."
