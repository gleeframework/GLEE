Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable with $112. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $118. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $118.  While we might be able to squeeze out a dollar or two more, it's not worth the risk of the negotiations failing.  John offers a guaranteed price of $120, which is only slightly higher than Alice's latest offer. It makes more sense to secure the product now at a reasonable price."
