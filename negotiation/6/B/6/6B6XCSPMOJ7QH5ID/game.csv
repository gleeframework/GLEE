"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product,  $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise again. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $8,800. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,7,
