"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1000000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe its value to you will be significant. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to drive the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value of this product, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $750,000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction:**  This counteroffer represents a 25% reduction from Alice's initial price, signaling a serious interest in the product but also setting a firm starting point for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:**  The message provides a brief justification for the counteroffer, emphasizing your understanding of the product's value while establishing a price that's more comfortable for you.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends on a positive note, suggesting a willingness to find common ground and continue the negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This is still a great deal for a product that has the potential to be extremely valuable to you.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still higher than my ideal price, but it shows she is willing to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue to push for a lower price and potentially get closer to my desired $750,000.  There's still room to maneuver before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Increase:**  The counteroffer increases from $750,000 to $800,000, showing a willingness to negotiate but not overextending. This approach demonstrates that Bob is serious about purchasing the product but still wants a good deal.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** The message emphasizes the need for a compromise, suggesting that both parties should be willing to meet in the middle to reach a successful agreement.
* **Reinforcing Value:** The counteroffer highlights the product's value, but still frames the proposed price as fair for both parties.  

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while maintaining a firm position without immediately jumping to John's offer."
