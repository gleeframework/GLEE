Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to maximize my profit. I know the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, so $20,000 is a good starting point.  I'll see if Bob is willing to pay that much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$10,000 is far too low for me. I know the product is worth more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price from him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer to $17,000. It's still significantly higher than Bob's counteroffer, but I'm willing to be flexible to see if we can reach an agreement. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is still too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $15,000, which is what John is offering. I'm going to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John and end the negotiation with Bob."
