"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially even more so than to me. To be fair, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is already a very competitive offer considering the value this product holds. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, I can still try to negotiate a lower price.  The middle ground seems like a fair compromise, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if we can get even closer to my target."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget at $1,100,000. Let's try $1,075,000 as a compromise. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to secure the product within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
