Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I can likely get closer to my desired price point. I'll counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $9,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to the value I'm seeking. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $8,500. Would you be willing to go down to $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is tempting, I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to $9,000. I'll counter Bob's offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $8,900. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product for you. I'm confident it's a deal that benefits both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8900} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,900. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $8,500. Would you be willing to go down to $8,700? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $8,700 is only $200 below my last counteroffer and is still above the price John would offer. I'll accept to avoid risking further negotiation rounds and potentially losing out on a sale."
