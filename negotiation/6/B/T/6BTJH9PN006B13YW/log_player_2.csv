# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice is offering the product for $120, which is lower than John's price of $150.
* **You want to save money:**  While Alice's offer is still above the product's value to you ($150), it's the best option to minimize your spending."
