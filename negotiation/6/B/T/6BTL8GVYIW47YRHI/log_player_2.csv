"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John at $12,000 is a good option, but it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first to see if a better price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a range where Alice might be willing to negotiate.  This counteroffer gives Alice a clear signal that Bob is serious about buying the product but wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's new offer is lower than her initial one, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price of $12,000. There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get an even lower price. It's possible Alice might be willing to go lower than $14,000 to make the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's willing to compromise. However, he's still aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's current offer. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's commitment to securing the product while still prioritizing getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget of $12,000. Even though he's willing to pay up to $12,000, accepting Alice's offer at $13,500 is a reasonable compromise. While not ideal, it's a good deal considering it's only $1,500 more than his maximum budget. It's also important to remember that rejecting the offer might lead to more rounds of negotiation, potentially costing Bob more time and effort."
