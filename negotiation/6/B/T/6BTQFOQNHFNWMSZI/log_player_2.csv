"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique and valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is only worth $8,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $9,500.  There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my interest in the product. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $8,200 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, it's still above his maximum value of $8,000. There's still potential to negotiate further and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I can go at this time.  I'm willing to offer $8,500. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a fair price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $8,800. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $8,800 is getting closer to his maximum value, there's still potential to get a better price.  He can try to counteroffer and see if he can get Alice down to $8,500 or even closer to his desired $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you getting closer to my range.  I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to go up to $8,600.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as we'd both be getting a fair price."", ""product_price"": 8600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,600. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,800 and $8,600, which would be $8,700. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's tempting to take it, it's still above his maximum value of $8,000.  He only has 3 rounds left, so there's not a lot of room for negotiation, but he can try one more time to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,700 is still a bit higher than I can go at this time. I'm willing to offer $8,500 one last time. This is my final offer, and it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,700 and $8,500, which would be $8,600. This is my final offer, and I hope you can consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  He only has one round left, and Alice is unwilling to go lower than $8,600.  While it's tempting to try and negotiate further,  it's unlikely Alice will budge. John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, which is the best option for Bob at this point."
