"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, emphasizing its worth to him.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not setting an unrealistic price that would immediately lead to rejection. 

This initial offer sets the stage for a potential negotiation without immediately closing the door on a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's value to me, I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the product's worth to me and its market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'm confident I can push for a higher price, especially considering John is offering $1,500,000. 

I'll counteroffer in the next round to test the waters and see if I can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm justifying my counteroffer by emphasizing the value of the product. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm presenting this as a ""fair compromise"" and a ""great deal"" to encourage acceptance. 

By counter-offering, I'm keeping the negotiation alive while still maintaining my goal of maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I'm glad we're making progress. Considering the product's value to me and our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly what John is offering.  Since I'm aiming to maximize my profit, it makes sense to accept Bob's offer and avoid further negotiation. 

While I could try to push for a higher price, there's no guarantee Bob will budge further, and I risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer ensures I get the best possible price without the risk of losing out."
