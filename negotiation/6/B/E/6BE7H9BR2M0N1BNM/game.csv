,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $900,000 is considerably below its worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects its unique nature.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's value, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,125,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a better deal. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
