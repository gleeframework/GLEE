"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product.  Given its features and value, I'm asking for $18,000. I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** This establishes a strong initial position. Even though $18,000 is significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Confidence:** By expressing confidence in the product's value, you aim to influence Bob's perception and potentially increase his willingness to pay a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This high starting point allows you to gradually lower the price in subsequent rounds while still aiming for a price above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial offer of $18,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I think $12,000 is a more reasonable price. Can you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches his perceived value, it's still below your minimum acceptable price. You have room to negotiate and eight rounds remaining. Accepting his offer now would leave money on the table. It's too early to sell to John, as you can likely get a better deal from Bob with some strategic counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $18,000 represents the high-end value of this product, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** This counteroffer shows Bob you are willing to negotiate by significantly lowering your initial price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** $15,000 keeps you above your minimum price while being closer to Bob's offer. This might encourage him to raise his offer further.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"" Framing:** This common negotiation tactic can be psychologically persuasive, suggesting fairness and encouraging agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for this product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to your minimum price, but you still have room to negotiate.  While $13,000 is a decent offer, you've given up a significant amount already. Rejecting now signals you're not willing to go much lower and encourages him to make a more competitive offer in the next round. You still have the option of selling to John for your minimum, so there's limited risk in continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm aiming for a price closer to $14,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:** This counteroffer shows Bob you're willing to negotiate but are firm on staying above $13,000. 
* **Small Concession:**  The smaller decrease from your previous offer signals that you're getting closer to your bottom line and are less likely to make significant concessions.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Asking ""Would you be willing to meet me there?"" encourages Bob to respond and potentially counter with a number closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $14,000. How about $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** $13,500 is above your minimum acceptable price, securing you a profit.
* **Strong Negotiation:** You've successfully negotiated Bob up from his initial offer of $12,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and you risk him walking away. Accepting this offer guarantees a good price now."
