"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  How about we start with $8,500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $8,750. This is a good middle ground that would allow us both to benefit from this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9,375. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,375 is still a bit too high for me. Let's compromise once more and aim for $9,000. This would be a fair price that benefits us both. ",9000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $9,125. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9125.0,Alice,7,
