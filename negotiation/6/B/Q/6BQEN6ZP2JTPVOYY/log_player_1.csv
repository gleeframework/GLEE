{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to haggle.  This approach balances getting a good price with keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, it's still below my target price. I'm going to try to push for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit closer to my original asking price.  How about $135?  That's still a good deal for you, considering what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure about $135. I was thinking more like $128. I really need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $128 is still slightly below my target, it's only $8 away and it's a better deal than selling to John.  I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
