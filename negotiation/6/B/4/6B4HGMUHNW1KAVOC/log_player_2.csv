"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm asking for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can definitely negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We want to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $120 maximum.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is friendly but clearly indicates the initial offer is not acceptable.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $85 puts us slightly above Alice's perceived value of the product, giving us a good chance of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is quite valuable to me. Could you do $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate. While $100 is closer to our desired price range, we're aiming to save as much as possible. Let's see if we can get her to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $92?"",
""product_price"": 92
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $92, we're splitting the difference between her offer of $100 and our previous counteroffer of $85. This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Moving Closer to Our Limit:** While we're still aiming lower, we're getting closer to our $120 maximum. This gives us some wiggle room if Alice counters again.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and collaborative, fostering a good negotiating environment."
