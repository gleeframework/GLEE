Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to discussion by asking for Bob's thoughts.

This approach aims to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open and potentially securing a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept an offer that drastically undervalues the product. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the new price, highlighting the value of the product to Bob. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, focusing on the mutual benefit of the deal.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still ensuring I receive a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $775,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired value.  It's clear that further negotiation with Bob might result in a lower price, potentially below my minimum threshold.

To ensure I secure a price that meets my needs, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $800,000. This guarantees me my minimum desired profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower price."
