"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $12,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  

I'm aiming to maximize my profit, and this price is within a reasonable range considering Bob values the product at $15,000.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a higher price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $8,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still going to reject it. I'm confident I can get a better price.  I have 6 rounds remaining, and I'm not willing to settle for this amount just yet. There's still potential for a more favorable deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, showing him I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves me room for profit. I'm hoping this will be the sweet spot, as we're getting closer to an agreeable price. We've got 5 rounds left, so there's still some time for negotiation."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. Considering we have only 4 rounds left and John is waiting to buy the product for $8,000, I'm going to accept this offer.  It's a decent profit, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale altogether."
