"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with a price that I think is fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $650,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a counteroffer. After reviewing my options, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice seems firm in her negotiations and unwilling to go much lower. Accepting at $825,000 is a reasonable deal considering it's significantly less than John's offer and still well below my $1,500,000 maximum."
