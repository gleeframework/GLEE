I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and also takes into account your willingness to pay $8,000.

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a better price, but $10,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair compromise.  It's closer to your price and still within my budget.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the price John is willing to pay, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",10000.0,Alice,5,
