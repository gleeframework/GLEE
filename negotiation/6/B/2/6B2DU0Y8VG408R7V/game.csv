"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  $9,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better deal, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,750. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $8,750 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $8,600. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can close the deal.",8600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $8,600. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $8,700. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs.",8700.0,Alice,5,
