"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is within his budget, it's still a higher price than he ideally wants to pay. He can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to be aggressive with his first counteroffer. He knows Alice values the product at $10,000, so he's offering a price slightly above that.  He hopes this will encourage Alice to negotiate further, but he's also prepared to walk away if she's unwilling to come down closer to his price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is slightly higher than her initial offer. While it's still within Bob's budget, it's not a good deal. He's still willing to negotiate further and see if he can get a better price from Alice. He's also keeping in mind that he can buy from John for $12,000 if the negotiations with Alice don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice he's serious about buying the product. However, he's still staying below $11,000, showing that he's willing to negotiate but also has a limit.  He's hoping this offer will be more appealing to Alice than her last counteroffer, but he's still prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting higher each round, but it's still within Bob's budget. However, he's still hoping to get a better deal. He's also aware that he can buy from John for $12,000 if he doesn't get a better price from Alice.  Therefore, he decides to continue negotiating and see if he can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10900}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, showing Alice that he is serious about buying the product. However, he is still careful not to go too high and risk losing the potential savings. He believes that this offer is close enough to Alice's valuation to be acceptable, but he is still prepared to walk away if she rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting increasingly closer to Bob's maximum budget, but it's still not a good deal for him. The negotiations seem to be stalled, and Alice is unwilling to come down significantly.  Considering that Bob has already made multiple counteroffers and Alice continues to reject them, it's highly likely that she won't accept his next counteroffer either.  It's becoming clear that a better deal is unlikely, and Bob is starting to run out of rounds.  Rather than risk getting stuck with a higher price or running out of time, Bob chooses to buy from John, securing the product at his maximum budget of $12,000."
