"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,500, which is still a fair price for the value of this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,250 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $11,750. This is a fair compromise, and I think it reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",11750.0,Alice,5,
