Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but still lower than my minimum value of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Space:** This gives us room for negotiation, allowing for potential counteroffers.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the price as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to consider it seriously.

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** My goal is to get closer to $12,000. Bob's counteroffer of $9,000 is still too low.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially push him closer to my desired price point.
* **John's Offer:** While John's $12,000 is tempting, there's still a chance I can get a better deal from Bob through negotiation.

**Next Steps:** I'll counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to $10,000, and see how he responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer represents a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Fairness Again:**  I reiterate the ""fairness"" of the price to subtly influence Bob.
* **Strategic Move:** This offer is closer to my ideal price while still remaining potentially acceptable to Bob. 

This counteroffer maintains the negotiation momentum and increases my potential earnings."
