Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Secure a Deal:**  While aiming high, the offer is still attractive enough compared to Bob's $12,000 valuation to likely secure a deal. It's important to remember that if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed $8,000 from John."
