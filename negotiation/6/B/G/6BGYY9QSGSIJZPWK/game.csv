"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. This is a great value considering the product's potential to revolutionize your business.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I recognize the value of this product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $650,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential to bring significant value to your business.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $750,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  I'm prepared to offer $700,000, which I believe is a fair price given my budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",725000.0,Alice,5,
