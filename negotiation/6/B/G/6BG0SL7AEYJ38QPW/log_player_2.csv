"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $110 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to you ($110 vs. your $120 maximum).  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $95 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $95 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $105 is still within my budget of $120. It's a better deal than buying from John for $120.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the product entirely or having Alice walk away is higher than the potential savings."
