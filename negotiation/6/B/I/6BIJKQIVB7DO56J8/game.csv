"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your position, my valuation of the product remains significantly higher.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This price reflects the true value and potential of the product.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $1,700,000 is still a bit higher than I can go.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and my budget.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, your offer demonstrates serious interest, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance to close this deal. I'm willing to accept $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
