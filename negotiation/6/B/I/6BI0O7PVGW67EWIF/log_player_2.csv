"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $1,400,000 is still a bit high, and there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects its value while also leaving room for both of us to profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,200,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price recognizes the value of the product while also demonstrating my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is closer to his desired price, he can likely still negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows him to potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high.  I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring the product, while also leaving room for us both to be satisfied with the deal. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. $1,250,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference - I'll accept $1,275,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and ensures both of us walk away with a positive outcome.  I'm hoping you'll agree to this final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still focused on saving money. While $1,275,000 is getting closer to his desired price, he still has room to negotiate.  There are only 5 rounds left, so it's important to keep pushing for a better price. Rejecting the offer allows him to counteroffer and potentially secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm genuinely interested in acquiring this product. However, $1,275,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,260,000. This reflects the value of the product while also providing a fair return for you. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that allows us to close the deal without further delays. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1260000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution. $1,260,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll accept $1,265,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also acknowledging your constraints.  I hope we can reach an agreement on this final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,265,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,265,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** There are only 3 rounds left, and it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. 
* **Small difference:** The difference between Alice's offer ($1,265,000) and Bob's last counteroffer ($1,260,000) is only $5,000. 
* **Better than John:**  $1,265,000 is still significantly cheaper than buying from John for $1,500,000.

At this point, it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer. He's saving a considerable amount of money compared to buying from John, and he's securing the product before the negotiation window closes."
