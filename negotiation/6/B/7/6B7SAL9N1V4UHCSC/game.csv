"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. I believe it's a fair price given the value it holds for you. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I understand the value of the product is significant to you, but I can only afford to pay up to $1,050,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1,100,000?  This would still give you a significant value for the product, and it would be a fair price for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I can consider a price of $1,075,000. I hope this helps move us closer towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your continued interest.  However, $1,075,000 is still below what I need to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,087,500.  Let's make this deal happen!",1087500.0,Alice,5,
