"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is tempting, you know you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can see if she'll lower her price further, potentially getting a better deal.  If not, you can always fall back on John's offer."
