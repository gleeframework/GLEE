"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our product to you. This unique opportunity is valued at $1200000, reflecting its exceptional quality and value. To make this proposition attractive, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $1100000. This is an exclusive chance to secure such a valuable asset at a reduced cost. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good deal, you can potentially get it for even less. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $1,100,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  This would be a win-win situation for both of us, as it gives me a good deal and still ensures you make a profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. Considering your offer, I am pleased to counter with a price of $1050000. This reflects a fair compromise, providing you with a substantial discount while ensuring a reasonable profit for us. I hope this proposal aligns with your expectations and we can move forward towards a successful transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is a significant reduction from her original price of $1,100,000.  This is a good deal, especially compared to buying from John for $1,200,000.  There's a chance you could negotiate further, but the risk of her rejecting your offer and ending up paying more from John outweighs the potential savings."
