"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  I believe it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows me to get a good return on my investment while also giving you a fantastic deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand it's a tough negotiation, but I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price still gives me a reasonable return on my investment, and it's closer to what I believe the product is worth. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,250,000. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay that much. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,225,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that balances my budget with the value the product will bring to my business.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
