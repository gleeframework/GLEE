"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe the product has potential, the price point is a little high for me right now.  I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to consider a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,100,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price for the value the product will bring to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
