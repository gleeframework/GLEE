"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,375,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
