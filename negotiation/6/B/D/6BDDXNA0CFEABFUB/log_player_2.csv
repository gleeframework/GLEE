"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $18,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth exploring negotiation with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $14,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my limit.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
