"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth.  I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle on $1,100,000? I think that's a fair price that would work well for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 isn't quite enough for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000. This price still allows me to achieve my desired value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,250,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we land at $1,175,000? This offer represents a significant investment from me while still acknowledging the value of the product.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  However, $1,175,000 is still below my desired price.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1,225,000. This compromise demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that benefits us both.  Let's see if we can bridge this gap and finalize a deal.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
