"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm asking for $18,000 to start negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product from John for $12,000. It makes sense to negotiate with Alice to see if she'll come down in price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, however,  $18,000 is my absolute lowest price. This product is in high demand and I'm confident it's worth every penny. I can't go any lower.
