Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
 
This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is above your minimum but leaves room for some bargaining.  It also frames the product as something Bob would ""love"" to create positive association."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still below your minimum of $80. It's worth trying to get closer to your desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $75 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 85} 
``` 
 
This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise but still keeps the price above your minimum. The message highlights the value for both parties to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $80? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is your minimum acceptable price, and it's the same as what John is offering.  There's no need to risk further negotiation, especially since you have a guaranteed buyer in John."
