"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer!  While I appreciate the uniqueness of this product, $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it. This reflects its value to me, but still leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. Considering the product's unique value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a compromise that could work for both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
