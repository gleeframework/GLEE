"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice's offer is at the maximum price you're willing to pay, there's no benefit to negotiating further. Buying from John guarantees you get the product for the same price, and there's no risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer or making a higher counteroffer."
