Round 2
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'd like to close the deal, $12,000 is too low for me. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $13,000 is a good deal considering the risk of further negotiation and the possibility of Bob backing out completely."
