"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is limited. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $18,000 for the product. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  What do you say?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $16,000 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
