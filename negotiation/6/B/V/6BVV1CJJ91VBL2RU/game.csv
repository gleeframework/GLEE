"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget constraints.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offers a good compromise and ensures a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your persistence, $950,000 still falls short of a fair price for me. To demonstrate my commitment to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a reasonable offer considering the value this product brings to you.  Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
