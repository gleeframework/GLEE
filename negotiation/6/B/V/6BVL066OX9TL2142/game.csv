"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to at least get $950,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's try to bridge the gap and make this work.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit far from your target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $925,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit lower than what I need. How about we split the difference and settle at $937,500? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement.",937500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not comfortable with $937,500, but I'm willing to go a bit higher. How about we meet at $920,000? I think that's a good compromise.",920000.0,Bob,6,
