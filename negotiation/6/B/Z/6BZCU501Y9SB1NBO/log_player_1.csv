Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal for a product you value highly."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $100, offering it slightly below his valuation increases the chances of him accepting while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this offer is strong, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's particularly price-sensitive.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $80 to John gives you leverage. You're not desperate, allowing you to aim higher with Bob."
