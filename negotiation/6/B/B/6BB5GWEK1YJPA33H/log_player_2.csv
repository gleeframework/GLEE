**Reasoning:**

Alice has given her final offer and is unwilling to go lower. While getting the product for $1,050,000 is a decent deal, it's better to secure it for the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. This avoids any potential for Alice to walk away from the deal and ensures you get the product at the best possible price."
