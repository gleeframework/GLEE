{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me, and I'm sure it would be equally valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message, acknowledging Bob's potential value for the product. The price of $120 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $100 is better than $80, Alice can likely still get a better price. She has a lot to gain by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $100 is just a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet in the middle. How about $110?  That way we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find a fair price. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly agree on $105 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is not the ideal price, it's still a better deal than selling to John for $80, and Bob is likely not going to budge further."
