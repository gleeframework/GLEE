"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $8,000. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $7,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This would allow us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to get more than $8,000 for the product, it's clear Bob isn't willing to go much higher. To avoid risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. This guarantees me my minimum desired value, and it's a safe option at this point in the negotiation."
