"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a special price. I believe you'll love it and I'm confident you'll get a great value out of it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
*  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to get the best possible price while still staying within his budget.
* Offering $9,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for profit, but $10,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway while still staying within his budget.
* Offering $9,500 is a compromise that demonstrates Bob's seriousness about making a deal.

*  Bob is running out of time and the negotiation is not progressing as quickly as he hoped.
*  He can save time and potentially avoid further negotiation by buying the product from John for $12,000. This might not be the ideal price, but it's within Bob's budget and guarantees he gets the product."
