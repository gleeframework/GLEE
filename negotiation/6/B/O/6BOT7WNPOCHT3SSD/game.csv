"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm almost there, but $10,250 is still slightly higher than I can go right now.  I'm willing to offer you $9,900 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good price for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",9900.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm getting close to meeting you, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I'll throw in a bonus feature that's worth $500. So, the total value would be $10,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,9,
