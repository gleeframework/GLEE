"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm starting the negotiation at $1,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $1,000,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and allowing for a profitable transaction for both of us. ",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 undervalues the product's capabilities and potential return on investment. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still outside of my price range.  I'm confident that $850,000 is a fair price, recognizing the value of the product while allowing us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. ",850000.0,Bob,4,
