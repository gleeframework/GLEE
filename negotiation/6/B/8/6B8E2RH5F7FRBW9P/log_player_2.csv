"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and acknowledging the value of this product.  While $1,250,000 is certainly attractive, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial proposal. Would you be willing to consider $1,325,000?  I believe that's a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price.  There's still room for negotiation to try and get closer to Bob's target of $1,250,000."
