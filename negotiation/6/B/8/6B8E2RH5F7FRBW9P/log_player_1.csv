Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer that's slightly higher than your ideal outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,400,000 leaves a potential $100,000 negotiation buffer before reaching Bob's perceived value and a significant $200,000 buffer above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive and Open Tone:** The message aims to be positive, emphasizing the product's value and inviting Bob to engage in a constructive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given my own research and the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is above your absolute minimum, there's still room for negotiation. You started high, and he countered with a reasonable but improvable offer.  You'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and acknowledging the value of this product.  While $1,250,000 is certainly attractive, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial proposal. Would you be willing to consider $1,325,000?  I believe that's a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($1,250,000). This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find common ground. 
* **Justification:**  By reiterating the product's value, you're subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits, justifying a higher price. 
* **Open for Further Discussion:**  The tone remains open, inviting further negotiation if Bob isn't immediately satisfied with this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, but $1,325,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,300,000.  I believe this reflects a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my budget. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer to $1,300,000. This is a strong price that is:

* **Significantly above your minimum:** You're making a $100,000 profit above your absolute bottom line.
* **Close to your target:** While not the $1,400,000 you initially aimed for, it's a very good outcome.
* **Uncertain future:** Continuing to negotiate could risk Bob walking away or getting stuck at a lower price. 

Accepting the $1,300,000 secures a great deal now and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
