You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is within his budget, it's still above what he could get from John.  It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a moderately aggressive counteroffer. He's aiming to get as close to his target price of $1,000,000 as possible while still leaving room for negotiation. It's likely Alice will reject this offer, but it sets the stage for a back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is closer to his target price, it's still above what John is offering. He should continue negotiating with Alice, seeing if he can bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly from the previous round. He's trying to show Alice that he's serious about buying the product but also that he's not willing to pay her full asking price. By offering a price closer to John's, he's putting pressure on Alice to accept his offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, Bob is still aiming to save more. He's within a reasonable range of his target price with John, so he should continue trying to negotiate with Alice, hoping she'll drop her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1090000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to increase his offer, but only slightly. He's aiming to meet Alice halfway while still staying within his budget. This approach shows persistence and a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,140,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,140,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached a point where Alice's offer is still too high.  He's only got a few rounds left, and Alice doesn't seem willing to budge significantly.  It's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product from John at a price he's comfortable with.  While he may be able to get a slightly better deal with Alice if he continues, the risk of not closing the deal outweighs the potential gains."
