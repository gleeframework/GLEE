You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price than $12,000, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 
I'm still confident I can get a better price than $12,000, so I'm counter-offering at $15,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is a significant drop from my initial asking price, I'm still holding out for more.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to try and reach a price closer to my desired $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price again to $13,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.  This shows I'm serious about making a deal, but I still want to maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of time.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the sale than to risk another rejection and potentially be forced to sell to John for $12,000."
