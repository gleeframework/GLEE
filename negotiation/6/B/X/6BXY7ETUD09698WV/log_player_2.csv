"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is less than Alice's value of $12,000, it's still above Bob's maximum of $10,000. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm able to go right now.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  I believe this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $10,500 is a bit lower than I'm aiming for, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This would still allow me to get a fair price for the product while giving you a significant saving.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his limit.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get the price down even further.  There are still several rounds left, and he might be able to get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit high at $11,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  I think this would be a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can close the deal at this point. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been steadily negotiating with Alice, but the price is still above his limit of $10,000. While there are still rounds left, it's becoming increasingly likely that Alice won't budge further.  It's better to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $10,000, ensuring he gets the product within his budget."
