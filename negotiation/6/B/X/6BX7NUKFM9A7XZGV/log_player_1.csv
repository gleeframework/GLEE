"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,800,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still aiming for a profit significantly higher than my minimum value.  I'll see if Bob is willing to bite at this price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,500,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get more.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,700,000.  This is a slight decrease from my initial offer but still significantly above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will show I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000.  This is a further decrease from my previous offer, but it's still a good amount. I'm hoping that by demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, I can get Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,350,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still do better. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,450,000. This is a significant decrease from my previous offer, but it still puts me well above Bob's latest offer. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to compromise and helps us reach a deal quickly before I have to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting late in the game and Bob seems unwilling to budge much further.  I'm not confident I can get a better price from him in the next round. To guarantee I at least reach my minimum, I'm going to sell to John."
