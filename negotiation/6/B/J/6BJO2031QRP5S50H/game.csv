"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget constraints, $11,500 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $13,000? This price is still fair considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a chance to make a deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12,500? I'm confident we can make a deal at this price.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $12,500 is getting closer to where I need to be, but I'm still a bit short.  Would you be willing to consider $13,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to close the deal with you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
