Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $75.  Would you consider $100? It's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $100, and you have a guaranteed option at $80 with John.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation."
