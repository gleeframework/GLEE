Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling flexibility, which is important in any negotiation.

This approach allows for potential profit while also keeping open the option of accepting John's offer if negotiations with Bob stall."
