Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you are still making a profit and getting closer to your desired price.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  Bob understands what you're offering and what you expect.

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's worth trying to get a bit closer to that by making a counteroffer to Bob. You can still walk away and sell to John for $12,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a little above that price point. How about we split the difference at $9,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer is higher than Bob's but lower than your desired price:** This shows you're willing to negotiate, while still staying within your own boundaries.
* **Focus on fairness:**  The message emphasizes that this is a ""fair price"" for both of you, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise.
* **Clear and concise:**  The offer is easy to understand, making it easier for Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to go up to $9,200 for the product. This is my final offer. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer is still $2,800 below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, it's likely that you won't be able to get much closer to your desired price.  You're guaranteed a sale with John at your desired price, so it's the most sensible option."
