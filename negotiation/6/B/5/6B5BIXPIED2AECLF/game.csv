"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $22,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle? I could let it go for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $18,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still quite a ways off from what I need. This product offers a lot of value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we settle at $16,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This price reflects the value of the product and my budget, and I hope we can find common ground.  What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,6,
