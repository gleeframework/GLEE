Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100?

While $100 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 
While I'd prefer to get a bit more, I've already gone down significantly and it seems Bob is firm on $100. John is a guaranteed $100, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob altogether."
