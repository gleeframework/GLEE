"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value proposition, I'm valuing it at $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have significant interest from other parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $800,000 from John, which is significantly less than Alice's $1,150,000 offer."
