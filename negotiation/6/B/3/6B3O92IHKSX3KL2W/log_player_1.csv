{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation.  It's also important to be friendly and encouraging to keep Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $125. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150).  It's better to try and get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $150?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's fair for me.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $150 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $135. This is a fair compromise, and it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $135 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell at a loss.  John is offering my desired price, so it's best to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
