"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $125. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $150?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's fair for me.  What do you say?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $150 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $135. This is a fair compromise, and it's a good deal for both of us.",135.0,Bob,4,
