Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my target price of $100.  I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit too high to go that low. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll still get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I can do $87.50. It's a fair offer and would allow me to get a good deal while you still make a decent profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a bit more, $87.50 is close to my minimum and a much better deal than selling to John. I'm happy to close the deal and move on."
