"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my desired price.  How about $1,500,000?  This is still a good deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
