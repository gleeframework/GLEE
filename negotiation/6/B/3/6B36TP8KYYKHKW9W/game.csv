"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? It's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  I understand your budget constraints but $9,500 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  How about we settle at $11,000 and we have a deal?",11000.0,Alice,5,
