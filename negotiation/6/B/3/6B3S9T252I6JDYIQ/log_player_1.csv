Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1400000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my profit. I believe Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my target. I believe Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me halfway."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiations.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether, and selling to John would be a significant loss for me."
