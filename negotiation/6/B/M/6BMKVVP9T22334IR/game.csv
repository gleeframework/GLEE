"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product worth $1000000 to you. My initial price is $1200000. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value you'll gain. Let's discuss!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1200000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for this product, which is still a significant gain for you. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.  Let's find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000. This offer acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement in this round.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 still falls short of what I need. I'm willing to go down to $1000000. This is my final offer, and it aligns with the value you've stated the product holds for you. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
