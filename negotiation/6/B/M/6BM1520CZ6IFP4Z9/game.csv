"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and it gives you a significant profit. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's try to find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a good deal for both of us - you'll make a solid profit, and I'll get the product within my budget. Let's try to meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $925,000.  This is a fair price that considers both of our needs. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to offer $875,000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers our respective positions.  Let's try to reach an agreement before the negotiation window closes.",875000.0,Bob,6,
