"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I do see the value in the product, $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe this is a reasonable price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate the movement. To be totally honest, $10,000 is the very highest I can go.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to close the deal today.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000, as it's worth at least $12,000 to me. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $11,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
