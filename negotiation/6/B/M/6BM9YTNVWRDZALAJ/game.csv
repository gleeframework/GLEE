"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $850,000. I appreciate your honesty about your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that considers both our positions. Let's try to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still below my minimum price. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. This is a very fair price considering our previous discussions, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you too. Let's finalize this and call it a day.",975000.0,Bob,6,
