"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,600,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I'm confident in the significant benefits this product offers and need to stay closer to my initial assessment. Would you be willing to consider $1,450,000? This feels like a reasonable compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm happy to continue this conversation.  $1,450,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'll go up to $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering the value I place on this product.  This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
