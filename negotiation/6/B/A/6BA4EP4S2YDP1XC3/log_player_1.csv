Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This gives me a decent profit while still potentially being attractive to Bob.  Since he values the product at $8,000, he might be willing to negotiate up to that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and still gives me a decent profit. Accepting his offer is the best option in this situation."
