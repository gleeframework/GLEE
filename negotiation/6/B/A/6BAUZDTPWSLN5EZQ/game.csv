"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? I'm confident this price will still represent a great value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's work together to make this happen!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm open to finding a compromise, $8750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9250. This price still leaves room for both of us to get a good deal, and it shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
