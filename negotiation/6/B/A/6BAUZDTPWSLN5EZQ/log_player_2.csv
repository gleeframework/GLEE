# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject Alice's offer and counteroffer. You can likely get the product for closer to your $8,000 limit by negotiating further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? I'm confident this price will still represent a great value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's work together to make this happen!

While $9,000 is closer to my budget, I can still try to get a better price. I'll reject Alice's offer and see if I can get closer to $8,500."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm open to finding a compromise, $8750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9250. This price still leaves room for both of us to get a good deal, and it shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer of $9,250 is still higher than my budget. While I can try to negotiate further, it seems like we are not going to reach an agreement. It's best to buy the product from John for $8,000 and save time and effort."
