``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still within a range that he might consider.  I'm also leaving room for negotiation, as I'm aware that he might counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm really looking to stay within my budget of $8000. Would you be willing to consider $8500 for the product?  I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial budget, it's still significantly lower than what I value the product at and what I could get from John.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm confident this price will still represent a great value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's work together to make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we split the difference and go with $8750? This would be a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:

While $8,750 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than what I value the product at. I'm going to reject this offer and try one more time to push for a higher price.  I'm hopeful that Bob is genuinely interested in the product and will be willing to compromise a bit more."
