Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable for you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is too high.  While it's within your budget, you want to save as much money as possible. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to present the product.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, based on my research and its potential value to me.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly significant, and I believe my initial offer is reflective of that.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down a bit, $1,050,000 is still above what you're hoping to pay. It's worth pushing for a lower price. There's still a significant gap between her offer and your desired price, and you have several rounds left to negotiate."
