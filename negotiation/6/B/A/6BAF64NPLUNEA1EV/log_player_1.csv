Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $100. I believe it's a great deal and would be valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you insight into how much he values the product and how much he might be willing to pay.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob."
