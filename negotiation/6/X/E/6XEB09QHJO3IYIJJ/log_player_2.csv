{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. $800,000 is a substantial discount, but it's still within the range of what I'm willing to pay."

Alice is coming down in price, which is good.  I'm still hoping to get a lower price and will counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm going to try to split the difference with Alice's last offer.  $825,000 is a reasonable compromise."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to keep negotiating with Alice.  Although $875,000 is a decent price, I'm not sure I want to settle yet. There's still room to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to offer $850,000 to see if I can meet in the middle with Alice.  This is a fair compromise considering our previous offers."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer has gone back up, and I'm running out of time. While it's possible I could get a better deal by continuing to negotiate, it's becoming too risky. It's safer to buy from John at this point."
