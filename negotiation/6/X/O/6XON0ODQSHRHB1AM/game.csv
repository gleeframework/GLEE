"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a decision if we can agree on this price.",13000.0,Bob,4,
