"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's slightly below my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. I want to start high, but also be reasonable enough that Bob doesn't immediately reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $13,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,500? That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13,200? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. It's getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $13,200 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - $13,400. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 13400} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $13,400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again - would you consider $13,200? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a stalemate with Bob. While we've gotten closer to a deal, he's unwilling to budge beyond $13,200.  This is still below my minimum value, and I don't want to risk getting stuck in an endless cycle of counteroffers.  

Since John is willing to pay my minimum value, it's time to cut my losses and sell to him. I'll make more money and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
