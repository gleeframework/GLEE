"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our exclusive product. We believe its value to you is immense, and we are offering it at a special price of $950,000. This is an opportunity not to be missed, given the high value you would derive from it. We look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Signals Interest:** It acknowledges Alice's offer and expresses continued interest in the product. 
* **Establishes a Position:** The counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaves the Door Open:** The message encourages Alice to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, I am pleased to offer the product to you at a price of $825,000. This is a competitive offer, considering the value you see in the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

While Alice is coming down, she's still quite a bit above John's price.  It's time to nudge her closer to your walk-away point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I could make a deal at $750,000. If that works for you, I'm ready to move forward."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

Here's the strategy:

* **Acknowledgment:** We thank Alice again to maintain a positive tone.
* **Firmness:** We make it clear that her previous offer is not acceptable.
* **Compromise:** Our counter-offer shows movement, but we're staying closer to our target.
* **Call to Action:** We end with a clear statement of our intent if she accepts. 

This approach aims to balance firmness with a willingness to negotiate, hopefully leading to a price closer to our ideal outcome."
