"Alice, thank you for the offer. $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your desired selling price. Let's see if we can make this deal work.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save as much as possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you and my desired selling price.",750000.0,Alice,3,
