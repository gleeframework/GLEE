"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm starting with a price of $150.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $120 is still below my minimum, and I think I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $135?  This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $135. How about $127.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price,  $127.5 is a decent compromise and above my minimum of $100.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and move on."
