"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  $900,000 is still a lot of money, and you have room to negotiate. You can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

You should start with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price.  A price of $750,000 is still above what the product is worth to Alice, giving her incentive to negotiate, but it also gives you a good starting point for a potential deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what the product is worth to her. You have room to negotiate further.  The longer the negotiations go on, the more pressure Alice will feel to sell to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

You should offer Alice $800,000. This is the minimum price that Alice is likely to accept since it is what the product is worth to her. By offering this price, you are showing Alice that you are serious about buying the product, but you are also not willing to overpay."
