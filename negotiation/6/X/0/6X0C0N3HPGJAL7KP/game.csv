"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $750,000 is a good starting point, it's a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $775,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $825,000. This is a fair price that accounts for the product's value.  Let's finalize this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
