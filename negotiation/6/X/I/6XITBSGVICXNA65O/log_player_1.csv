Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act swiftly."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob is worth the attempt.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's buying price ($1,400,000) creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob. 
* **Limited-Time Pressure:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" I increase the chance of Bob making a quick decision without overthinking and comparing it to the market value (which is unknown to him).

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the security of John's offer."
