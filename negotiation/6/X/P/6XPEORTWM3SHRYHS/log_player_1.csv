Round 2
Bob's offer:

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and while Bob is willing to pay close to my desired price, I'm running out of time.  To guarantee a sale and avoid risking a deal falling through, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. It's a safe option, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale."
