It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a better price.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but there's likely room for improvement."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to half of Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying but am also prepared to walk away."

$825,000 is still too high. I'll counteroffer again, trying to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4

Alice's offer is still too high.  We're getting closer, but I'm going to counteroffer one more time to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 775000}

Alice's offer: The product price will be $807,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $807,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

We've reached a point where Alice's offer is within my budget, and it's likely that further negotiation won't get me a significantly lower price. It's time to close the deal before running the risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away, or losing out on the opportunity to buy the product at a reasonable price from John."
