"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $14,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is a fair starting point for negotiations. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,500 is too low for me. This product has a lot of value that I think justifies a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's compromise at $9,500. This would allow us both to walk away with a deal we can be happy with.",9500.0,Bob,4,
