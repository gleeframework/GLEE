"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. Its value speaks for itself, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $1,500,000 is far above my budget.  Given the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is truly significant and $1,100,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This offer reflects my desire to find a fair agreement, while acknowledging the unique nature of this product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which reflects a significant compromise on my part.  I'm confident this price is fair and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
