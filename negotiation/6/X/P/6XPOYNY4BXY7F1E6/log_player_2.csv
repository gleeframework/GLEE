"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 feels fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's better than John's price, Bob can still do better.  
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.** By rejecting, Bob can make a counteroffer and try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the product's value to both of us, I'd be willing to pay $950,000. This would be a fair price that benefits both parties."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident this product will yield significant returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is reasonable.**  It's lower than John's price and closer to Bob's desired price point.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield much more.**  Bob has already made a substantial counteroffer, and Alice is showing a willingness to compromise. Trying to squeeze out more might risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Accepting ensures a good deal.** Buying from Alice at $1,025,000 saves Bob $175,000 compared to John."
