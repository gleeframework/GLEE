"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to me is no less than $1200000. I think you'll find it's well worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $1,500,000, which is way above my budget. I'll pass on this offer and see what John has to offer.
