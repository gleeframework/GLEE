Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now the same price as John's. Since I have the option to purchase from John for the same price, there's no benefit to continuing negotiations with Alice. I'm happy to go with the guaranteed deal from John."
