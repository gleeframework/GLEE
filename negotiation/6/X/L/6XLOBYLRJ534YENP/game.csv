"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay $9,500, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,200 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're getting close to your target, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,200 and $11,000, so I'll offer it to you for $10,800. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",10800.0,Alice,5,

"I can see you're really close to getting a deal, Bob! I'm willing to make a slight concession to $10,600. It's a great price considering the value you'll get from the product, and I think it's a fair compromise.",10600.0,Alice,7,

"I can see you're really close to getting a deal, Bob! I'm willing to make one last concession to $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,9,

"I'm not comfortable with $10,500, Alice. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",10000.0,Bob,10,
