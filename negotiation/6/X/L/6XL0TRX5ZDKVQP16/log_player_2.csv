"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1200000. This is a fair and competitive offer, considering the product's worth to me is at least $1500000. I believe you'll find it's a steal at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price point. While it seems like Alice is getting a good deal, your goal is to buy the product. There's no benefit to rejecting the offer and then buying from John for the same price."
