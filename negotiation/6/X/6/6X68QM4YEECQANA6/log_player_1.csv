{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value of $120, but still below my minimum of $150. This gives me room to negotiate while also leaving a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $145 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $130 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a great price for the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $140, but I'm still a bit hesitant at that price. How about $135? That seems like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $135 is closer to my minimum, I'm not comfortable settling for that price. John is offering me my minimum, and I'm confident I can get a better deal with John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
