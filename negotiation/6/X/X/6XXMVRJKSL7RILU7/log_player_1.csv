{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is above your minimum price of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation while still being attractive to Bob, who values the product at $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, there's still some room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I'm looking for something closer to $9,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is only $250 less than your previous counteroffer of $9,000.  It's likely that further negotiation won't get you much more, and you risk losing the sale entirely if you keep pushing for a higher price.  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale that's within a reasonable distance of your target price."
