"Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant price reduction, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $987,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny.  What do you say?",987500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $956,250?",956250.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle once more.  How about $971,875?  This is a fair compromise and a good price for both of us.  I'm confident you won't regret this purchase.",971875.0,Alice,7,
