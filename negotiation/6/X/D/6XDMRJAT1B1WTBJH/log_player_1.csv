"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you about this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $1,800,000."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both our valuations. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's eagerness. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, I'm aiming to set a reference point that influences Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Preserving the Option of John:** I'm aware that I have John as a backup buyer, but I want to explore maximizing my profit with Bob before resorting to that option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my valuation and his own stated valuation. While I want to make a deal, accepting such a low offer would be leaving a lot of money on the table. I believe I can negotiate a better price by countering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 is considerably below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,400,000?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** I've made a substantial decrease from my initial offer to signal flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, the drop is not so drastic as to appear desperate.
* **Still Above Valuations:**  My counteroffer remains significantly above both my own and Bob's valuations, ensuring that even if further compromises are made, I'm still aiming for a strong profit.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** By explicitly mentioning ""middle ground,"" I'm reinforcing the collaborative nature of this negotiation and encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I understand the value, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress, but $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept and secure a profit over John's offer, I believe I can push for a slightly better deal in the remaining rounds. Bob's incremental increases suggest he's willing to move closer to my price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer. I can sense we're both motivated to make this work.  How about we land at $1,200,000?  That's a significant move on my part to meet you closer to your budget."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Encouraging Progress:** I'm acknowledging Bob's movement and framing the negotiation positively to keep momentum going. 
* **Substantial but Strategic Concession:**  Dropping to $1,200,000 is a significant concession, but it still keeps the price well above my minimum and allows room for potential further negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** By emphasizing it as a ""significant move,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the concessions I'm making to reach an agreement. 
* **Time Consideration:**  We're over halfway through the rounds, and I want to increase the pressure slightly to reach a deal soon without appearing overly eager."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we are getting close!  To bridge the gap, I can do $1,050,000. This offer reflects how serious I am about purchasing this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above John's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,050,000 exceeds what I can get from John, guaranteeing a profit.
* **Strong Position:** While I could potentially push for a little more, Bob's offer is now in a reasonable range above my minimum. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation reaching an impasse. Accepting now secures a good deal. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal sooner allows me to utilize the funds for other potential investments or opportunities."
