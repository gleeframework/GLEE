Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. This is a one-time offer, so what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for potential negotiation with Bob, should he try to counter-offer. 
* **High but Reasonable:** While the price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it's not outrageously so. It might entice Bob if he really wants the product and considers it a ""good deal"" compared to the unknown future market. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
