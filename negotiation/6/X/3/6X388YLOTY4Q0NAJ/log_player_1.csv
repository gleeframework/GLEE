Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it presents a great value at this price and would be a valuable addition for you."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a price closer to my valuation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($12,000), but it's presented as a ""take it or leave it"" deal, potentially prompting him to act quickly before reconsidering.

It's a calculated risk, but if Bob accepts, I earn more than selling to John. If he rejects, I still have my guaranteed sale."
