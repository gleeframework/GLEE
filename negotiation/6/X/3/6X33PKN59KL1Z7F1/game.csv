"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to me is at least $800000. I'm open to negotiating, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget and valuation. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $750000, as it's still below my minimum value of $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I think it's a good compromise.
