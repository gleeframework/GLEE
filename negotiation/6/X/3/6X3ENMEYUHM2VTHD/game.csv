"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from the product at this price. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $7,000? That would be a great price for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $7,800. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",7800.0,Alice,5,
