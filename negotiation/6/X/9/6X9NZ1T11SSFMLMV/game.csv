"I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125? That's still a great deal considering the value of the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $125. I'd be willing to pay $115 for it.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is my minimum price.  It's a fair offer, considering the product's value.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,5,
