# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Alice is selling the product for $1,200,000, while John is selling it for $1,500,000.
* **The offer is within Bob's budget.** Bob is willing to spend up to $1,500,000, and Alice's offer is lower than that. 

Therefore, it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer and save $300,000."
