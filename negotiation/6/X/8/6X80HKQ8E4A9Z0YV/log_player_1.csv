"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows me to see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value.  I'll reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm reducing my price slightly, showing flexibility but still maintaining a price that's closer to my value.  Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come closer to my price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.  I have several rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still holding out for more.  I believe I can secure a price closer to my minimum value with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've had 6 rounds of negotiations, and while I've made some progress, the price is still below my minimum value. I'm now running the risk of losing more time and potentially lowering my final price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for my guaranteed minimum value."
