"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'd be willing to pay $150 for it. What do you think?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, but I was thinking more along the lines of $180. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $180 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $160 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still a bit far from being willing to part with the product for $160. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $180 and $160, so I'll offer it to you for $170. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,5,
