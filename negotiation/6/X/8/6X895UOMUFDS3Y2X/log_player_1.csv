Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to aim high with Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Starting with a significantly higher price ($1,500,000) allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a much higher profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, it opens the door for negotiation. You can then gradually lower the price, knowing your minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price."
