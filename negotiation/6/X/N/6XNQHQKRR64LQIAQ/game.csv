"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm afraid $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Can you consider a more reasonable price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Alice. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and my previous offer of $12,000, which would be $13,000. Can you consider this price?",13000.0,Bob,6,
