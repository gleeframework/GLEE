"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is significantly higher. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I do see the value in this product, $900000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to still make a good profit.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value is significantly higher. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
