"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $10,500. This is a great compromise, considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer.  I can appreciate the compromise, but I'm afraid $10,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,5,
