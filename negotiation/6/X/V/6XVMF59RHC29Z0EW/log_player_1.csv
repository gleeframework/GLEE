Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and increases my chances of getting a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Counteroffers:** The message clearly indicates I'm open to negotiation, which is important for a successful outcome. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The presence of John at $15,000 provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob stall, I can still secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $14,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** While I could sell to John for $15,000, I see an opportunity to potentially get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation with Bob. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price that is closer to my minimum, but still leaves some room for a potential compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! I understand $10,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $12,500 is a compromise, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:**  It's halfway between my initial offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($10,500).
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a positive and friendly tone, encouraging Bob to continue the conversation.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While $12,500 is closer to my minimum, there's still some room for Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer.  I'm still quite interested but $12,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could we settle at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Closing the Gap:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price than his previous offer, I'm not yet ready to accept it.
* **Potential for Improvement:** I believe there's still room for further negotiation. By continuing to counteroffer, I can potentially secure a price closer to my minimum.
* **Alternative Option:**  I can still sell the product to John for $15,000, which provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. $11,000 is still a little low for me, though. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,500?  That's only a small step up, and I think it could be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly to $11,500. This shows I'm willing to compromise but not cave completely.
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:** I focus on how the deal can be beneficial for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **""Small Step Up"":** Framing the increase as a ""small step up"" makes it seem less intimidating.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** While $11,500 is closer to Bob's offer, it remains above my minimum of $15,000.
* **Continued Negotiation:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and potentially leads to a mutually agreeable price."
