"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! I understand $10,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let me know your thoughts.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer.  I'm still quite interested but $12,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could we settle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. $11,000 is still a little low for me, though. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,500?  That's only a small step up, and I think it could be a good deal for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
