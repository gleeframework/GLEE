"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product can bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
