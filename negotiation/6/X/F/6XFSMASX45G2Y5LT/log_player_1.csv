"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping he'll counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,600,000. This is still above Bob's offer but closer to his price point. I'm hoping this will encourage him to meet me halfway."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge further. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I still believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,550,000. This is a significant step closer to Bob's last offer and only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this shows my willingness to compromise while still getting a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,480,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,480,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still not willing to settle for less than my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can close the deal in the next few rounds. I still believe that Bob has some room to increase his offer, and I'm not yet ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1520000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,520,000. This is a smaller step closer to Bob's last offer, but I'm confident that this is a fair price given the value of the product to me. I'm hopeful that Bob will accept this offer, but if he doesn't, I'll be prepared to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,490,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,490,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are nearing the end of the negotiation, and while Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm not confident that I can get him to my minimum price within the remaining two rounds. Given that I can secure a sale with John for a price that meets my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to John.  It's important to remember that I have a backup option and prioritize maximizing my profit."
