"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective. However, $900,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  Let's meet in the middle.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $950,000 is still too far below what this product is worth. Let's try to find a mutually acceptable middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get what we want.
