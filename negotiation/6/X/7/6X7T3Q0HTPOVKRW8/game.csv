"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Could we settle around $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective. However, $900,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for my product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $950,000 is still too far below what this product is worth. Let's try to find a mutually acceptable middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get what we want.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
