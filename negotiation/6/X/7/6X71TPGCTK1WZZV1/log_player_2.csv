"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth $800,000 to you. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $700,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. There are 9 rounds left, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product. This is still a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to come to an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $675,000. This is a fair compromise that still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $675,000 is closer to my desired price, I still believe there's room for further negotiation. I'm willing to keep pushing for a lower price, and I have 7 rounds left to do so. Rejecting this offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my target, potentially saving even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $675,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $660,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to make a decent deal. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 660000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $660,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $670,000. This is a fair price considering the value to you and still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still not willing to go down to my target price. However, she's getting closer, and the offer of $670,000 is only $10,000 above my previous counteroffer. I have 5 rounds left, and I'm confident that I can get her to come down a little more. Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm seeing some progress here.  $670,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I still need to be a bit more mindful of my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $665,000.  This feels like a solid compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 665000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $665,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $668,000. This is a fair price considering the value to you and still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $668,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $668,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now only $3,000 away from my target price, and we only have 3 rounds left.  It's unlikely that we'll be able to close the gap further in such a short time. Accepting this offer means I can secure the product for a price that's $132,000 less than what John is offering, which is a significant saving."
