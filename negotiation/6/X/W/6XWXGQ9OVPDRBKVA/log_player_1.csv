""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price and I'm eager to find a good home for it."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $8,000 helps set the upper limit of the offer.
* **John as Backup:** Having a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 gives Alice leverage.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering slightly below $15,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate, while still exceeding his perceived value.

By offering the product at $14,999, Alice aims to:

1. **Secure a Significant Profit:** If Bob accepts, Alice makes a substantial profit over her minimum acceptable price.
2. **Maintain Leverage:**  The offer is still attractive enough that Bob might consider it, while Alice doesn't lose much if he declines."
