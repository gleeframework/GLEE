Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $20,000."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly mention the product's value to Bob, it hints at its benefits, aiming to justify the high price.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject this offer outright. However, it maximizes your potential profit if Bob is willing to negotiate or accept a high price."
