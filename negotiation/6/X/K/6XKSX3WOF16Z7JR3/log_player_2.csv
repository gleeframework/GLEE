# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,400,000 is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  You have 10 rounds and Alice is likely to come down in price to close the deal.  
* **John's offer is a backup:** You can always go to John if negotiations fail, but it's worth trying to get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. Given the value you've placed on the product at $1,000,000, I'd like to propose a starting price of $1,200,000.  I'm eager to explore this deal further and believe this price is a good starting point for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value this product brings is truly exceptional and goes beyond a simple starting point.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I believe a price of $1,325,000 reflects a fairer deal for both of us.  This still leaves us room for discussion, and I'm interested in hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  $1,325,000 is closer to your budget but still above your ideal price.
* **Further negotiation is necessary:** You still have 7 rounds remaining and can likely push for a lower price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  You can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations stall."
