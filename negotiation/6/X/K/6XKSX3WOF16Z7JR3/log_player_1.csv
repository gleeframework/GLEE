Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. Given the value you've placed on the product at $1,000,000, I'd like to propose a starting price of $1,200,000.  I'm eager to explore this deal further and believe this price is a good starting point for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,287,500 is still a bit steep. To demonstrate my continued interest in this product, I'm willing to go up to $1,262,500.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,262,500.
