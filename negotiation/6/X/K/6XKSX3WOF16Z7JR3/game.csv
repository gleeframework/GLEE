"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. Given the value you've placed on the product at $1,000,000, I'd like to propose a starting price of $1,200,000.  I'm eager to explore this deal further and believe this price is a good starting point for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value this product brings is truly exceptional and goes beyond a simple starting point.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I believe a price of $1,325,000 reflects a fairer deal for both of us.  This still leaves us room for discussion, and I'm interested in hearing your thoughts.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,325,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. This demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring it and allows for further discussion. What are your thoughts?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I value your interest and recognize your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,287,500? This represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the true value of this product.",1287500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,287,500 is still a bit steep. To demonstrate my continued interest in this product, I'm willing to go up to $1,262,500. This represents a significant step towards a mutually agreeable price, and I'm confident we can reach a final agreement. Let's close this deal.",1262500.0,Bob,6,
