"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about $95? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. Can you consider $92? I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $92 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $94 is the absolute lowest I can go. If you're serious about getting this product, I think this is a fair price.",94.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to walking away, but I still think we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about $91? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",91.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. It seems we're very close to a deal. $91 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.  How about we settle on $93? It's a fair price for both of us.",93.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you consider one more compromise? How about $92? I'm really close to walking away, but I still think this product could be a great fit for me.",92.0,Bob,8,
