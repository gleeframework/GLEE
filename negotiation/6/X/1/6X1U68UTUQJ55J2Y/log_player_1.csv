Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I can still try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  I have 8 rounds left and don't want to settle for the minimum just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
