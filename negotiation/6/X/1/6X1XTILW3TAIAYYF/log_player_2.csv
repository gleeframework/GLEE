Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $787,500 is close, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This is my minimum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let's seal the deal.
