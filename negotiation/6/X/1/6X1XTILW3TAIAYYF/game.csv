"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is a good starting point, it's unfortunately too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $750,000 just isn't enough for me.  Let's try $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs and leaves room for a comfortable profit for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we both deserve a fair profit. How about we split the difference and settle at $787,500? That seems like a win-win to me.",787500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $787,500 is close, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This is my minimum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let's seal the deal.",800000.0,Alice,7,
