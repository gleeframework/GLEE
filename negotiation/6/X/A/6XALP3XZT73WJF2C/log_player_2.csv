You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we meet at $125?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not sure I can go as low as $115, but I'm willing to meet you at $123. I think that's a fair price for this great product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $123. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $123
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $123 secures a decent discount while avoiding the risk of the negotiation breaking down and having to buy from John at $150."
