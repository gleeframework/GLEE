Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, giving Bob room to negotiate. This also allows me to gauge his interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's low offer, I'm not ready to settle for the minimum just yet. I'll try to push for a higher price with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering the price to $15,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still remaining above my minimum. I hope to find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is significantly better than my minimum and is a good compromise.  While I could potentially try to push for more, it's risky, and there's a chance Bob might walk away. I'll accept his offer to secure the sale."
