"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $80 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $105? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. I'm getting closer, but $105 is still a touch more than I'd like to spend. How about $90?",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than $100, as that's the minimum I'm comfortable with. However, I'm willing to throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal. How about we meet at $95? It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with the additional value you'll get.",95.0,Alice,5,
