Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than $100, as that's the minimum I'm comfortable with. However, I'm willing to throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal. How about we meet at $95? It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with the additional value you'll get. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $95, and it's not worth the risk of continued negotiation. John offers a guaranteed price of $100, which is better than the current offer."
