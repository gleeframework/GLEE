"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits it can bring to you. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1500000 is unfortunately outside of my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which is my absolute maximum. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still a bit constrained by your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise to find a mutually beneficial solution. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a fair price that's closer to my minimum, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
