"Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, and I know you'd find it equally valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. This is a great price for both of us, as I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.  Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,1,
