"Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a good deal, there's potential to save even more.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good discount. This price is still attractive to Alice as she values the product at $800,000.  I'm hoping to strike a deal that's mutually beneficial."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $720,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant discount from her initial offer and is still within my budget. Further negotiation might save a bit more, but the risk of losing the deal or having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential gains."
