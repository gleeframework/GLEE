Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $170. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you."", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $60 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $140. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product provides."", ""product_price"": 140}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $140 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $75?  I think that's a fair offer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. How about $115? This is already quite a reduction."", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $115 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  How about $80? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently been unwilling to move substantially from his initial offer. His final offer of $80 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  Continuing negotiations is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. John provides a guaranteed sale at your desired minimum.  It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob."
