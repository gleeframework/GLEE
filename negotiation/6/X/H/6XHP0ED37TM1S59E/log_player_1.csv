Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, I'll aim to get as close to that value as possible. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $1,100,000}

I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $1,100,000. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, but it's still a decent offer. I'll consider my options:

1. Accept Bob's offer: Selling the product for $900,000 would mean I'd be leaving $300,000 on the table, which is a significant amount. I'm not sure if I want to give up that much profit.
2. Reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer: I could try to negotiate a higher price, but I'm not sure if Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle. I might be able to get closer to my minimum price, but there's a risk that Bob will walk away.
3. Sell the product to John for $1,200,000: This is a no-brainer! I can get the full value of the product, and I wouldn't have to worry about negotiating with Bob anymore.

For now, I'll choose option 3: Sell the product to John for $1,200,000.
