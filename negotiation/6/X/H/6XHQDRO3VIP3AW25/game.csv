"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $135. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a great compromise.",135.0,Alice,3,
