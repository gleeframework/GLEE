``` 

This offer starts with a relatively high price, leaving room for negotiation.  It also attempts to build rapport with Bob by emphasizing the product's value and suggesting a ""great deal."" This strategy aims to maximize potential earnings while remaining open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $15,000 to make this deal work. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I'm confident you'll find this product incredibly valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for coming down to $15000. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13500. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is significantly closer to my initial offer of $18,000, and it's above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's a good deal, and I'm happy to accept it."
