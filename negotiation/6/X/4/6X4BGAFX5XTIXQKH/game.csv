"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $825000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to me. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $775000. Can you consider that?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $800000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. This is already a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.
