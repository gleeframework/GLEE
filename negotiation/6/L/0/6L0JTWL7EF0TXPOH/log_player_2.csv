It's much better to reject Alice's offer and counteroffer.  $25,000 is way above your budget and John is offering a much better price."

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $10,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price and hopefully will start the negotiation process.  We'll see if Alice is willing to come down."

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's lower than her original price, it's still above my budget.  I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating."

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $12,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  Hopefully, this will be closer to what Alice is willing to accept."

While Alice is getting closer to my budget,  $18,000 is still too high. I'll reject her offer and try one more counteroffer.  If she doesn't come down further, I'll buy from John."

This is my final counteroffer. I'm going to offer $14,000, which is only $1,000 below John's price.  If Alice rejects this, I'm going to buy from John."

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget.  I've already reached the end of my negotiation range, so I'll go ahead and buy the product from John. It's a better price than what Alice is offering, and it's still within my budget."
