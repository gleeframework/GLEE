"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for a product worth at least $15,000 to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  While the product is valuable, $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $9,500.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $9,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still represents a significant discount for you, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than where I can go right now. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $10,250.  This is a fair price that's still beneficial for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10250.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal.  What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,6,
