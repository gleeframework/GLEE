Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $9,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still represents a significant discount for you, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

While $11,000 is a better price than the initial offer, it's still above your target of $8,000. Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."

While $10,750 is getting closer to your target, it's still above what you're willing to pay. It's worth one more counteroffer to try and get a better deal before you consider buying from John."
