"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $950,000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000, which is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to my range, I'm still not quite there.  I'm proposing $875,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering at $925,000, which is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be realistic here. While I understand the value of this product, $925,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $890,000.  I believe this offer reflects a fair compromise and allows us to reach an agreement.",890000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $900,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to consider. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to go up to $895,000. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the highest I can go at this time.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal and avoid having to consider other options.",895000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the bottom line. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see a significant increase from your end. I'm counteroffering at $915,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to consider. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",915000.0,Alice,9,
