Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $12,000. How about $12,500?

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $12,800, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,600. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd like to get closer to $13,000, Bob has presented this as his final offer. Accepting $12,600 is a strong profit, significantly exceeding my minimum sale price and John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away, forcing me to accept John's lower offer."
