"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is quite a bit higher than what I had in mind. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving up on the offer, but the value of this product is substantial.  I'm willing to accept $950,000 - it's my final offer. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
