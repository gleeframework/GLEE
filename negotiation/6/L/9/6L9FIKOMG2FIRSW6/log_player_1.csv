Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 gives Bob the impression that it's highly valuable while still allowing room for you to potentially negotiate down to a price above your minimum.
* **Open Communication:** The message encourages a dialogue, allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 

**Important Note:** This is just one potential strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and knowledge about Bob's potential interest, you could adjust the offer price accordingly."
