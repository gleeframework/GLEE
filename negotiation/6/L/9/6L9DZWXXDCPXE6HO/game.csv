,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $75 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $82.50? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.5,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $81. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",81.0,Alice,5,
