"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am offering you my unique product for $120. This is an opportunity to acquire a valuable item worth more than its asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While the product might be worth more than $120, you're only willing to pay up to $120.  Rejecting allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. After considering your offer, I am unable to accept it. However, I would like to make a counteroffer at $110 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $110 is within your budget of $120, making it a good deal.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price and you risk losing the product altogether."
