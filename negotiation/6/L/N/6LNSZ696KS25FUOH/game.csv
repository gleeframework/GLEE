"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to try to get as close to my budget as possible. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to compromise. While $10000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11500. This is still a great deal for you considering the product's value, and it gives us both some room to work with. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see we're getting closer to a deal. However, $11500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11250. Can you consider this price?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  However, $11250 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to drop my price to $11375. This is a fair compromise that keeps the value of the product in mind. What do you think?",11375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11375 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this price?",11200.0,Bob,6,
