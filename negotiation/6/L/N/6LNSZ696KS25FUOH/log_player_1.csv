Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum price of $12,000, maximizing your potential profit.
* **It's not too high:**  Starting too high might scare Bob off immediately. 
* **It's friendly and inviting:**  A positive message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

Remember, you have the option to walk away and sell to John at any time. This gives you leverage and ensures you won't settle for an unfair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to try to get as close to my budget as possible. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and even lower than your initial offer ($13,000).  While Bob is showing interest, accepting his offer would be a loss for you.  

**Next Steps:**

Since you've rejected Bob's offer, you'll need to send a counteroffer in the next round. You can try to meet him halfway or adjust your offer based on his response. However, remember that you can always choose to sell to John if the negotiation doesn't reach a satisfactory price for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to compromise. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is still a great deal for you considering the product's value, and it gives us both some room to work with. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise but stay above your minimum:**  You've lowered your price from $13,000 to $11,500, showing flexibility, but still remaining above your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Highlight value for Bob:**  You're emphasizing the product's value to encourage Bob to consider your offer. 
* **Positive tone:**  Keeping the communication positive and open to negotiation can help you reach a mutually agreeable price.

Remember, you can always choose to sell to John for $12,000 if this counteroffer doesn't work out.  This gives you the power to end the negotiation if it's not beneficial to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see we're getting closer to a deal. However, $11500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11250. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to your desired price, $11,250 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Accepting his offer would mean losing money on the sale.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to send a counteroffer in the next round.  Consider meeting Bob halfway again or proposing a slightly lower price than your previous offer, but ensure it's still above your minimum. Remember, you can always choose to sell to John if you feel the negotiation is taking you too far below your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  However, $11,250 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to drop my price to $11,375. This is a fair compromise that keeps the value of the product in mind. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11375}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway (almost):** This offer splits the difference between your previous offer ($11,500) and Bob's offer ($11,250).  It shows you're committed to reaching a deal.
* **Staying above your minimum:**  This offer still allows you to earn more than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Positive and open tone:**  The message maintains a positive and encouraging tone, suggesting you're open to further negotiation.

**Remember:**  You always have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if you feel the negotiation isn't going in your favor. This gives you leverage and ensures you don't settle for a price that's significantly lower than your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11375 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,200 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While you've been willing to negotiate and compromise,  it seems like you've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob won't lead to a profitable outcome for you. 

Since you have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $12,000,  selling to John is the best choice in this situation. It ensures you achieve your minimum desired price and avoids further potentially fruitless negotiation with Bob."
