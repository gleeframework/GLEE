Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me somewhere. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $120 threshold. Accepting $90 is a loss compared to John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale."
