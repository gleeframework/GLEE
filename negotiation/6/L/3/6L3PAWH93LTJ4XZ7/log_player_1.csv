"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an ambitious price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but it allows for some negotiating room. I don't know Bob's valuation, so I'm hoping to gauge his interest and potentially establish a higher starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm hoping to get.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price. There are still 8 rounds left, so I have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $14,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It's a  realistic price that I believe Bob might be willing to accept, while still giving me a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,725. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,725
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,725 is a significant improvement from his previous offer and is closer to my desired price.  With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a decent profit, and it's still well above my minimum acceptable price."
