Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000? I believe that would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
