"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's find a middle ground that works.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $775,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference and go with $787,500?  I believe this would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",787500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $787,500 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775,000 and $787,500, which would be $781,250. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",781250.0,Bob,6,
