Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Value justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" without being too specific. This subtly encourages Bob to justify a lower price if he counter-offers.
* **Urgency and scarcity:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** This strategy assumes you don't have much information about Bob's negotiation style. If you know he's particularly averse to high starting prices, you might adjust accordingly. 
* **Relationship building:**  While aiming for the highest price, consider if a long-term business relationship with Bob is valuable. A slightly lower price might be strategic in the long run."
