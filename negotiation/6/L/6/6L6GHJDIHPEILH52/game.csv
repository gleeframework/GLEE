"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $5,000? I think that's a fair price.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is too far below what I need to sell the product. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $5,000, but $9,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Would you be willing to settle for $7,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 still doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a substantial compromise. This offers you a good deal, as you value the product at $8,000, and gets me closer to my desired price. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,5,
