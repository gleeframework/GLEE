"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not setting a hard line, allowing for flexibility in the negotiation. 

I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value of $15,000 as possible, but I'm also aware of the time limit and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $5,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low:**  $5,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000 and even below Bob's own perceived value of $8,000. 
* **Time is a factor:** While I'm not desperate to sell, I don't want to waste too much time on a counteroffer that is unlikely to lead to a deal. 
* **John is a safe bet:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value. 

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is too far below what I need to sell the product. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** $9,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $8,000.
* **Progress towards my goal:** This offer moves me closer to my desired price, while still keeping the deal potentially viable. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm prepared to keep negotiating or switch to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $5,000, but $9,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Would you be willing to settle for $7,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $7,000 is still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. While it's closer to my target, it's not a deal I'm comfortable accepting.
* **Risk of further delays:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean I'm not getting close to my desired price and I'm losing valuable time. 
* **John is still a better option:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, but I'll continue to consider selling to John as a safe and profitable alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 still doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a substantial compromise. This offers you a good deal, as you value the product at $8,000, and gets me closer to my desired price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's current offer, demonstrating flexibility and a desire to reach a compromise.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I'm highlighting that the offer is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $8,000.
* **Progress towards my goal:** $8,500 is significantly closer to my minimum value of $15,000, while still leaving some room for further negotiation if necessary.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm prepared to keep negotiating or switch to John if it doesn't lead to a deal."
