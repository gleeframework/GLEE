"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe it has great potential for you, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential profit. 
* **Showing Flexibility:** I'm emphasizing my willingness to negotiate to encourage Bob to engage in the process. 
* **High Value Appeal:**  Mentioning the product's ""great potential"" aims to spark Bob's interest and make him consider the value beyond just the price. 
* **First Round Strategy:** In the first round, it's crucial to gauge Bob's interest and set a starting point.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:**  Bob's offer is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This suggests that the product might hold even more value to him.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I believe the product is worth more. This sets the stage for a potential counteroffer from me in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I'm not willing to settle for $900,000 yet, as there's a chance I can secure a higher price through continued negotiation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John for $800,000 guarantees a sale, I'm willing to take a calculated risk in the hopes of achieving a more profitable outcome with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit higher.  How about $950,000?  I'm confident this product will be highly valuable for your business.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still holding out for a higher price, creating a sense of compromise.
* **Focus on Value:**  Reiterating the product's potential value reinforces the justification for a higher price.
* **Mutual Benefit:** Highlighting the need for a ""mutually beneficial"" price fosters a cooperative tone, encouraging further negotiation. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** This counteroffer allows room for further negotiation while staying within a range that is profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $920000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress Toward Agreement:** Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting closer to my desired price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away.  $920,000 is a very profitable sale.
* **Time Factor:**  We're already in round 4, and time is of the essence.  Accepting this offer secures a significant profit while minimizing the risk of a deal falling through.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $800,000 would be a guarantee, but accepting Bob's offer gives me a $120,000 profit over that.

Considering all these factors, it's strategically beneficial to accept Bob's offer in this round."
