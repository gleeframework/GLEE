"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a valuable piece and I believe it would be a great asset for you.  This price is fair, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is under your maximum budget, you know John is willing to sell the same product for $1,000,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to pursue the guaranteed lower price from John."
