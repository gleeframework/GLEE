"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognize the value of this product. However, my initial offer considered its worth in the current market and its potential for your specific needs.

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need you to understand the value proposition here.  This product isn't just about immediate gain, it's about long-term potential, which is reflected in my pricing.  I'm willing to move down slightly to $1,025,000, but that's my firm offer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting close, but your counteroffers aren't reflecting the significant value this product offers.  I'm open to closing this deal, but it needs to make sense for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but this is my final offer.  If this doesn't work, I'll need to pursue other opportunities.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already compromised a lot, and I don't think I can go any higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting close to walking away. I propose a price of $990,000. This is my final offer.",990000.0,Bob,8,
