"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a competitive price. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

Buying from Alice for $950,000 is better than buying from John for $1,000,000. Although the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, your goal is to save as much money as possible, and accepting Alice's offer achieves that."
