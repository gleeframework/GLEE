Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $120 is more than your minimum of $80, ensuring you profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $120 is less than what Bob is willing to pay, leaving room for potential negotiation. 

This strategy allows you to maximize your potential earnings while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! That's a nice product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $90 is above your minimum, you can likely do better.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer, potentially closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $100? I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than what John is offering and is only slightly lower than your last counteroffer. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit while also securing a sale."
