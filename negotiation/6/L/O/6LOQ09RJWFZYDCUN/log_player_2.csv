{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price.  You have 10 rounds, so there's room to bargain."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This establishes my willingness to negotiate and sets a lower bound for the price.  I'm aiming for a price close to my maximum budget but leaving room for potential compromise."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget.  I want to try to get closer to my target price.  There are still 7 rounds left, so I have time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to offer my maximum budget.  This demonstrates my seriousness about buying the product and leaves minimal room for further negotiation.  If Alice rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John, as I'm running out of room to bargain."
