While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,600,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** It's still a $100,000 profit over John's guaranteed offer. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing might not yield much more, and there's always the risk Bob walks away.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now allows me to reinvest the capital sooner."
