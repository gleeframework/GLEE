"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can find a price that works for everyone.  I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000.  Let me know your thoughts!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I believe this product has great potential, $1,750,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,400,000 for this product to make it worthwhile. Let's keep talking, I'm confident we can find a fair price.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000?  This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
