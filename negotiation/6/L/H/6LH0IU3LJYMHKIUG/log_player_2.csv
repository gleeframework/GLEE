Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $110 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $112.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I think it's a good compromise. $112.50 is still a decent price and worth it to avoid going to John and paying $150."
