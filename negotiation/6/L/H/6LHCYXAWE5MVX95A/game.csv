"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its worth to me and allows us both to close this deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'll make a revised offer: I'll sell the product to you for $12,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",12800.0,Alice,5,
