"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $11,000? This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
