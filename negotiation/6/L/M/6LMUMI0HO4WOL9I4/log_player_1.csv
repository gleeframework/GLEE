Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I aim for the highest price Bob might accept, which is just below my guaranteed sale price to John ($15,000). 
* **Urgency and Value:** My message implies a degree of exclusivity and emphasizes the value proposition to encourage Bob to accept.

This strategy attempts to secure the highest possible profit while still making the offer appealing enough for Bob to consider seriously."
