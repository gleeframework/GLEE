"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $105?  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting a valuable product for a price significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let's close this deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $107.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $109. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal. ",109.0,Alice,5,
