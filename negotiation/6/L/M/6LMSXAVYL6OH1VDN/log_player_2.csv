"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting a valuable product for a price significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.
