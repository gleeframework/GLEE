"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $8,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I see the value in the product,  $8,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.",8000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I value the product,  $8,000 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $7,500?  I think that's a fair price considering where we both started.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $7,500. I'm willing to offer you a deal at $8,250. This is my final concession, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $8,250 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Let's try $7,750. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering we're both making concessions.",7750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $8,100. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",8100.0,Alice,7,
