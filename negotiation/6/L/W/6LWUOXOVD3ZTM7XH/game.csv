"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,300,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know the product is worth $1,200,000 to you.  Let me know your thoughts!",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,250,000? This gives us both a good deal and allows me to make a profit. Let's meet in the middle!",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $1,150,000?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away satisfied.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're being stubborn, but I'm still open to a deal. How about $1,200,000?  That's my bottom line. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it gives me a decent profit.  Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
