"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to signal that we're looking for a significantly lower price.  We'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to consider something closer to $6,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** Starting with a low offer (significantly below my $10,000 maximum) gives us room to negotiate and signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counter-offer will help me understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. 
* **Alternative Option:** I still have the option to buy from John for $10,000, so there's no pressure to accept a bad deal from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I could meet you halfway at $12,000. This feels like a fair compromise. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:**  Alice moving to $12,000 is a good sign that she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Still Above Budget:**  However, $12,000 is still above our $10,000 maximum and above John's offer.
* **Continued Negotiation:** We need to continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to a price that works for us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $8,000? That would make this a really attractive deal for me."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** We're moving closer to our $10,000 limit but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (""too high for my budget"") helps keep the negotiation moving without seeming arbitrary.
* **Creating Urgency:** Phrasing like ""a really attractive deal for me"" suggests we're getting close to a point where we might take the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,000? That's my absolute bottom line. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Our Limit:** Alice has come down to our maximum price of $10,000.
* **Matches John's Offer:** There's no benefit to trying to negotiate further since we can get the same price from John.
* **Securing the Deal:** Accepting now ensures we get the product at a price we're comfortable with."
