"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $82 is a fairer price for the product. It's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a discounted rate. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'd like to propose $75. Would you be willing to consider that?",75.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll propose $87. It's a fair price for the product, and I think you'll find it's a great value. What do you think?",87.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $87, Alice. I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a final offer of $79. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll take the product. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80.",79.0,Bob,6,
