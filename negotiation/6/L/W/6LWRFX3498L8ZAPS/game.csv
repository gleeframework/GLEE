"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  This represents a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable asset at a reasonable price.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to offer $9,250 for the product.  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe we can both walk away satisfied with the deal.",9250.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,250. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I believe it's a fair price for a valuable asset like this.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $10,000 is closer, but I'm still stretched a bit. How about $9,500?  This would be a fair compromise, allowing us to reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",9500.0,Bob,6,
