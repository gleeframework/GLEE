"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate you coming up. I could go down to $180, but I can't go any lower than that. It's really a great product, and I'm sure you'll get a lot of use out of it.",180.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is great, but I'm still not comfortable paying $180. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $120, so I'll offer $140. Can you consider that?",140.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $160? That's a very fair price for this product.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $140, so I'll offer $130. Can you consider that?",130.0,Bob,6,
