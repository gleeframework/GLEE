{""product_price"": 2000000}

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening that allows for negotiation.  I'm aiming to get as much as possible, while still leaving room for a potential compromise."

While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'll keep trying to negotiate with Bob. I want to see if he's willing to go higher."

I'm going to make a final counteroffer of $1,550,000. This is just above my minimum price of $1,500,000, demonstrating a genuine desire to close the deal while still maintaining a reasonable profit. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise."
