"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However,  $900,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $750,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and your own valuation.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still beneficial for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for the product. This price is fair to both of us, considering your valuation and the product's worth to me. Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. This is the minimum price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's true value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
