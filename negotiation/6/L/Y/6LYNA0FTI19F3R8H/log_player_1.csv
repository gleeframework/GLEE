Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives you a significant profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $950,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:** I emphasize the value the product has for Bob, highlighting the potential profit he can make.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This price allows for some room for Bob to counteroffer without making me feel pressured to accept immediately. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging to keep the negotiation going.

**Important Note:**  I'm keeping John in mind. If Bob rejects my offer and his counteroffers don't meet my minimum, I can always sell to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Opportunity for counter-negotiation:**  I believe I can still get a better price than $750,000. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially reach a more favorable deal.
* **Selling to John is not optimal:** While selling to John guarantees $800,000, I'm aiming for a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $950,000, while still being open to negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $750,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which still leaves you a substantial profit margin.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** My counteroffer of $875,000 is a compromise, significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. 
* **Highlighting value and profit:** I reiterate the value of the product and emphasize the profit potential for Bob.
* **Seeking a middle ground:** I explicitly invite Bob to find a compromise that benefits both of us. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  The message remains friendly and encourages continued negotiations. 

**Important Note:** By rejecting Bob's initial offer and counter-offering, I'm showing my determination to get a better price while also showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $875,000. Can we try $812,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is above my minimum:**  $812,500 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Limited room for further negotiation:** While I could try to counter-offer again, it's likely that Bob will stick to his price, as he's already offered a compromise.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, I risk Bob walking away completely, leaving me with the less desirable option of selling to John for $800,000.

**Conclusion:**

Given the current situation, accepting Bob's offer of $812,500 is the most logical choice. It secures a price above my minimum while minimizing the risk of losing the deal entirely."
