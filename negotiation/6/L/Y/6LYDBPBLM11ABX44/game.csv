"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $10,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $17,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $10,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $14,000. It's a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's still a good value for the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I'm willing to go up to $16,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. It's a good price for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,7,
