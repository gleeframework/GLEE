* **Alice's offer is too high.**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $1,750,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible.**  Alice has expressed openness to discussion, so there's potential to get a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net.**  If negotiations with Alice fail, you have a fallback option with John."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,400,000 is below my desired range, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,600,000.  This reflects the value of the product, while also providing you with a fair price. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I need to stay within my budget.

Let's reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
