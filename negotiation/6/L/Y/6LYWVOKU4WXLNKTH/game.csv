"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,400,000 is below my desired range, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,600,000.  This reflects the value of the product, while also providing you with a fair price. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,550,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while keeping it within my financial constraints. Let's reach a deal that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
