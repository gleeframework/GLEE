Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob. However, the value of this product is substantial and I can't go as low as $10,000.  Would you consider $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

```
At this point, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price.
