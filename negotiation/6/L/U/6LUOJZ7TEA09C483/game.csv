"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit. Let's finalize this deal!",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $900,000.  This price would be a fair compromise for both of us.  I'm confident we can close this deal if we can agree on this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
