"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! Based on its value, I'm asking for $1,000,000.  This price reflects the product's unique capabilities and its potential to benefit your business. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's discuss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is too high.  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit. Let's finalize this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $900,000.
