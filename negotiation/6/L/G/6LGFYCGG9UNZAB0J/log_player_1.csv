Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $14,000."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $10,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $14,000, you're leaving some profit for Bob ($1,000) while maximizing your own gain. This price is more appealing to Bob than going with another buyer.
* **Backup Option:**  You have the security of John who will buy it for $10,000 if Bob declines.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at the highest price he's likely to accept, given that he knows it's valuable but also that you have other options."
