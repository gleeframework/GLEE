Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a price that is higher than his perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price. If he rejects, I can always move on to John and sell for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a price that's so far below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a slight compromise by lowering my price to $13,500. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows my willingness to find a middle ground. I believe this is a fair price that still ensures I get a decent profit."
