"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $1,200,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but it's still too high. I can definitely try to get a better price by making a counteroffer.  There's no guarantee I'll succeed, but the potential savings are worth the risk."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750,000. Considering its true value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it's a great deal.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still not good enough. I'm still aiming for a lower price, so I'll reject and counteroffer again. There's a chance she might be more flexible if I show I'm serious about negotiating."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'll offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is close enough to my target range that it's worth accepting.  Further negotiation might get me a slightly lower price, but the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for a much higher price isn't worth it.  I'm comfortable with the savings I've achieved so far."
