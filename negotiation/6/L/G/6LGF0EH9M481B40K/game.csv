"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $700,000 undervalues the product's unique capabilities and long-term benefits. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $800,000. However, I value our discussions and believe you'd greatly benefit from this product.  Would you be willing to meet me at $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm still not comfortable going above $750,000. I'd like to reiterate my previous offer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",750000.0,Bob,6,
