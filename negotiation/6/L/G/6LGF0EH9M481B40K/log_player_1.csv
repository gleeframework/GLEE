"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""value and potential"" provides a soft justification for the high price without revealing your absolute bottom line.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Framing the offer as a ""starting point"" clearly signals your willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $700,000 is tempting, it's significantly below both your minimum and his perceived value of the product.  You have room to negotiate and aim for a higher price. Selling to John for $800,000 is a safe option, but you can likely get a better deal with Bob with some skillful negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $700,000 undervalues the product's unique capabilities and long-term benefits. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $850,000?"",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Counter:** Acknowledging Bob's perspective shows you're listening, but you directly counter his valuation.
* **Highlight Value:**  Reiterating the product's ""unique capabilities"" and ""long-term benefits"" reinforces its worth beyond a simple market comparison. 
* **Show Flexibility:** By offering to meet ""halfway,"" you demonstrate willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing he's willing to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still below John's offer and considerably less than your target price. You have room to push a bit further, especially since Bob seems interested."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $800,000. However, I value our discussions and believe you'd greatly benefit from this product.  Would you be willing to meet me at $825,000?"",
""product_price"": 825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Leverage:** Revealing John's offer creates a sense of urgency and competition, subtly pressuring Bob to increase his offer.
* **Maintaining Relationship:** You reiterate your preference for closing the deal with Bob, which could make him more receptive. 
* **Compromise:** By slightly lowering your previous offer, you demonstrate flexibility while still aiming for a price above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your transparency, but I'm still not comfortable going above $750,000. I'd like to reiterate my previous offer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob seems anchored to $750,000 and unwilling to budge further.  He's had multiple opportunities to meet your price or propose a counteroffer closer to your expectations. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $800,000, it's no longer strategically sound to continue negotiating with Bob. Accepting John's offer ensures a profitable outcome without risking a stalemate or further concessions."
