"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1200000 for the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its potential, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to consider a price of $900000.  This would allow us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1100000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1100000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm prepared to offer $1000000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away with a positive outcome.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're close to making a decision, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make another concession and propose a price of $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  While $1050000 is closer to where I need to be, I'm still hoping for a final price that reflects the product's value fairly for both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $1025000.  This would allow us to close the deal without sacrificing too much on either side.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a fair price, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1025000. I'm proposing a price of $1075000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
