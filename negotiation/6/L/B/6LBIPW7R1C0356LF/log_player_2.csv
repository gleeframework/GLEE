"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high. It's significantly above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. There's no point in accepting this offer. I'll counteroffer and try to negotiate a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $2,000,000 is simply out of my price range.  I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $1,200,000. This is my absolute maximum, given its value to me.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty and interest.  While $2,000,000 represents my initial asking price, I'm open to finding a compromise.  Would you consider $1,750,000? This would be a significant reduction on my end, reflecting my willingness to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While she has reduced her price, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'll stick to my counteroffer of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me. As I mentioned before, my absolute maximum is $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  How about we meet halfway at $1,500,000?  This is a significant concession from my original price and ensures a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While she has been willing to negotiate, it seems unlikely she'll come down to my price.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John, who is offering a price within my budget."
