"Alice,  $2,000,000 is simply out of my price range.  I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $1,200,000. This is my absolute maximum, given its value to me.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and interest.  While $2,000,000 represents my initial asking price, I'm open to finding a compromise.  Would you consider $1,750,000? This would be a significant reduction on my end, reflecting my willingness to make a deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me. As I mentioned before, my absolute maximum is $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  How about we meet halfway at $1,500,000?  This is a significant concession from my original price and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
