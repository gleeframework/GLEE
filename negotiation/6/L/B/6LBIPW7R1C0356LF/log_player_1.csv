Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,000,000 is simply out of my price range.  I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $1,200,000. This is my absolute maximum, given its value to me.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me. As I mentioned before, my absolute maximum is $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.
