Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since I don't know the value of the product to him, I'll start with a relatively high price. I'll offer Bob the product for:

{""product_price"": $900,000}

This is a price that is slightly above the minimum value of the product to me, but still reasonable considering its value to Bob. Let's see how he responds!"
