"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it at $1,500,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,280,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on it at $1,200,000.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
