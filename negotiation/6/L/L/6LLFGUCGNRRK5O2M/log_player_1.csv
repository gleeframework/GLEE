Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price reflecting its worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I value the product at and what it's worth to him. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,120,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,080,000, which is closer to my budget and reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we still have room to negotiate. I'm aiming to secure a price closer to $1.1 million."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle on $1,100,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer! I'm willing to go up to $1,090,000.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and $1,090,000 is a solid profit. It's time to close the deal."
