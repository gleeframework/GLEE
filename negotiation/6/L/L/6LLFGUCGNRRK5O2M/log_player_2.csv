"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price reflecting its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save money. While Alice has come down slightly, $1,120,000 is still above Bob's ideal price point. Rejecting allows for further negotiation and the potential to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,120,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,080,000, which is closer to my budget and reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle on $1,100,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still a gap. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and has already offered $1,080,000.  Rejecting allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to his desired amount.  It's also worth noting that Bob has 5 rounds left and could still go to John if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer! I'm willing to go up to $1,090,000.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1090000}
