"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $135.  Let me know what you think!",135.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $135 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $125 is just a bit too low for me.  How about $130? It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's find a solution we can both agree on.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $127.50. Let's make this deal happen!",127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $127.50 is still a bit below what I need. How about we split the difference at $128.75? It's a small step closer to a deal, and it's a price that's fair for both of us.  What do you say?",128.75,Alice,5,
