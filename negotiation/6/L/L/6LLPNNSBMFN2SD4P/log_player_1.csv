{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This allows for some room to negotiate down if Bob is interested but doesn't think it's worth that much.  It also demonstrates that I value the product and am not desperate to sell quickly.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy with $12,000, I'm not desperate. Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'd prefer to get closer to my initial offer. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $15,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a good compromise. It's closer to my initial offer, and I'm confident I can get a higher price from another buyer if I continue negotiating.  It's a good deal, and I'll accept it."
