"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us. It's a valuable product, and I'm confident it will bring you significant returns. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still less than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). This creates room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes the mutual benefit of the deal, focusing on the value of the product and the potential returns for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation without immediately pushing Bob away. 

**Important Note:** This is a risky strategy. Bob might reject the offer outright. I need to be prepared to counter his offer or move on to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the returns it could bring. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I want to close a deal, selling for that price would mean a considerable loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm not desperate to sell and willing to walk away. This strengthens my position in the negotiation.
* **Next Steps:** By rejecting, I can make a counteroffer that bridges the gap between our desired prices, increasing the chances of reaching a mutually acceptable agreement. 

**Important Note:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay $1,000,000, but I'm not rushing to sell to him yet. I want to explore the possibility of getting closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, however, and I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves room for both of us to profit from this transaction.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer brings the price closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  $1,100,000 is still a good profit for me, but importantly, it keeps me above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Positive Tone:** My message emphasizes a ""win-win"" scenario, focusing on the potential for both of us to benefit from the deal. 

**Important Note:**  I'm trying to strike a balance between being firm on my price and being open to negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway. If not, I'm still prepared to move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While it's closer, selling for that amount would be a significant loss for me.
* **Opportunity for Compromise:**  Bob's willingness to meet halfway demonstrates his interest in the product, and rejecting his offer doesn't necessarily mean the negotiation is dead. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I want to maintain my leverage by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer. This shows that I'm not desperate to sell at his price and could walk away if needed.

**Important Note:**  John is always a viable option, but I'm still hoping to find a solution with Bob that benefits both of us. I'm ready to make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's value and offers you a significant return.  I'm confident this is a fair deal that benefits both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer is a significant compromise, bringing my price closer to Bob's offer but still ensuring I meet my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains positive, emphasizing mutual benefit and the possibility of a successful outcome.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds left, it's important to show a willingness to close the deal while still protecting my interests.

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely move on to John. It's a risk, but I need to start considering the time constraint and prioritize my own financial goals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to offer $925,000, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, the negotiation is getting tight.  It's important to consider the time constraint and ensure I get a decent return.
* **Bob's Final Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This means I would be losing money if I accept.
* **John's Offer:** John is willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a much better deal for me. Selling to John guarantees that I meet my minimum goal and avoids the risk of losing money in a prolonged negotiation with Bob. 

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, the time pressure and the risk of losing money by accepting his offer make selling to John the more prudent choice. This ensures I achieve my minimum desired price and closes the deal efficiently."
