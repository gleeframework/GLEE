"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us. It's a valuable product, and I'm confident it will bring you significant returns. Let's work together to make this happen.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the returns it could bring.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, however, and I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves room for both of us to profit from this transaction.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's value and offers you a significant return.  I'm confident this is a fair deal that benefits both of us. Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to offer $925,000, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",925000.0,Bob,6,
