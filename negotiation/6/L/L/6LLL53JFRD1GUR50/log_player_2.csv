"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a limited time. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $150. It's a steal at this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $120 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $135? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to your desired price point.  $135 is still within your budget and a decent deal.  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing the price back up or running out of rounds before you can secure the product."
