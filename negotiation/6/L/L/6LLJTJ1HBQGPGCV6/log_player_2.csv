"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $120, while John wants $150. 
* **You're still saving money:** Even though you're paying more than the product's worth to Alice ($80), you're still saving $30 compared to buying from John."
