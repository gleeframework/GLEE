"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We understand that $850,000 is a significant discount, but we still need to ensure we get a fair price for the product. After reconsidering, we're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product at a price of $950,000. We believe this is a reasonable compromise that takes into account your budget and the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to my budget, it's still outside of my comfortable range.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. We're getting close to a deal, but we still need to ensure we get a price that reflects the product's true value. After re-evaluating our options, we're willing to offer the product at a price of $920,000. This is the lowest price we're willing to accept, and we believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, but $920,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $910,000 for the product.  This is a final offer from my side, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal and move forward.",910000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we understand that you're making a final offer, and we appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're not willing to accept $910,000.
