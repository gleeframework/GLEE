Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered. Let me know your thoughts, and we can certainly talk."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down later.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""immense value,"" Alice subtly reinforces the product's worth, potentially making the higher price more palatable to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""we can certainly talk"" signals to Bob that Alice is willing to negotiate, preventing him from immediately rejecting the offer if he finds it too high. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice knows she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, so there's less pressure to accept a lowball offer from Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit.  However, there's always a risk that Bob might find the initial price too high and walk away. Alice needs to be prepared to potentially lower her asking price during the negotiation if needed."
