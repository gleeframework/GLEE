Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $12000. What do you think?,11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to consider this unique product. However, $11500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Would you be willing to consider $10500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
