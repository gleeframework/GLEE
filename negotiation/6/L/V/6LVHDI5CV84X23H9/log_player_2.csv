# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $12000. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
