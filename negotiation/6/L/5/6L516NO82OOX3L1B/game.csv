"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  How about $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a good offer, I need to be closer to $100 to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  That seems fair to both of us.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92.50 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88, but that's my final offer.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer.  While $88 is a good offer, I still need to be a bit higher to make this work for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $90?  It's a good price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the product.",90.0,Alice,5,
