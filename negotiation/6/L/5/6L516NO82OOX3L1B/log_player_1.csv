"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $110."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob ($80). This sets the stage for negotiation and allows for some room to compromise.
* **Ambiguous Value:**  I'm using general language about the product's value to avoid revealing my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The price is not drastically higher than Bob's perceived value, making a counteroffer likely.

**Strategy:**

This strategy is based on maximizing my earnings while being open to a deal. By starting high, I create a situation where Bob has to make a counteroffer. This gives me the opportunity to either accept his counteroffer (if it's close enough to my minimum) or make a counter-counteroffer to close the deal closer to my desired price. 

If the negotiation stalls or I feel I won't get a better price from Bob, I can always switch to John, who will buy the product for my minimum acceptable price of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $100 mark that I'm comfortable with.
* **Negotiation room:** I have room to negotiate further and potentially reach a higher price.
* **John's offer:**  Selling to John guarantees me $100, but I believe there's a good chance of getting a better price from Bob if I continue negotiating.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and demonstrate my willingness to bargain. This will hopefully encourage Bob to come closer to my minimum price.  I'm confident that I can either close a deal with Bob for a price higher than $85 or switch to John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a good offer, I need to be closer to $100 to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  That seems fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and fairness:** I'm presenting a compromise by suggesting a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This conveys a willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Specific number:** I'm giving a specific number to show I'm serious about reaching an agreement. 
* **Rationale:**  I'm providing a justification for the price (""split the difference"") to make my counteroffer seem reasonable and fair.

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise price, I aim to:

* **Move the negotiation closer to my target:**  $92.50 is closer to my desired price of $100 than Bob's last offer. 
* **Show flexibility:**  This demonstrates that I'm open to a deal and not simply trying to get the highest possible price.
* **Increase the likelihood of acceptance:**  Presenting a fair compromise increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer and closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92.50 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88, but that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **""Final offer"" doesn't mean much:** Bob's declaration of a ""final offer"" is a common negotiating tactic. It's unlikely he'll stick to it if there's a chance of getting the product for a lower price.
* **John's offer:**  Selling to John would guarantee me $100, but I still see room for improvement with Bob.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm holding out for a better deal. It's likely that Bob will counteroffer again, and I'll be ready to negotiate further.  If the negotiation stalls, I have the option of selling to John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer.  While $88 is a good offer, I still need to be a bit higher to make this work for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $90?  It's a good price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint compromise:** I'm offering a compromise price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to meet in the middle and find a solution that works for both of us. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the benefits for Bob (""good price for both of us,"" ""you'll be happy with the product"").
* **Finality:**  I'm not explicitly stating it's my final offer, but the language implies that I'm serious about reaching an agreement at this price point.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Close the gap:**  $90 is significantly closer to my target of $100.
* **Show flexibility:**  My willingness to compromise increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer.
* **Set the stage for a possible final offer:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can use it as a basis for a slightly lower counteroffer in the next round, if necessary. 

It's important to remember that I can always switch to John and sell for $100 if I feel the negotiation with Bob is not going well."
