Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,450,000 is higher than your minimum of $1,200,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's space for him to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **It shows you're serious about selling:** You're not starting at a ridiculously high price, which could make Bob lose interest.

Remember, you can always adjust your price based on Bob's response. Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is still above your minimum, it's significantly lower than your initial offer and leaves less room for profit.  It's worth pushing for a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Bob with a price closer to your initial offer.  This will give you a better chance of getting a price you're happy with.

**Counteroffer Example:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This counteroffer is a good strategy because:

* **It's a compromise:** You're meeting Bob halfway by dropping your price, showing you're willing to negotiate.
* **It's still profitable:** $1,400,000 is still above your minimum of $1,200,000, ensuring you make a good profit.
* **It leaves the door open:** You're not closing the deal completely, giving Bob a chance to counter again if necessary. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1400000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1350000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is still a bit lower than what I would prefer, it's getting closer to my ideal price.  Considering that Bob is unlikely to budge much further, and selling to John would be significantly lower, it's in my best interest to accept this offer. 

**Why it makes sense:**

* **Close to your target:** $1,350,000 is only $100,000 away from your initial offer, which is a reasonable compromise. 
* **Better than John's offer:**  Accepting Bob's offer means earning $150,000 more than selling to John.
* **Avoiding further negotiations:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to further delays and might not result in a better price.

Accepting Bob's offer allows for a quick sale and a profit that is acceptable."
