"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a better price than John's $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $750,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and allows for both of us to make a profit.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting a lower counteroffer and potentially losing the deal altogether is too high. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a favorable price."
