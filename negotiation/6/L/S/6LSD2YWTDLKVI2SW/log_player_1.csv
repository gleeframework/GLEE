Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer it at $150 to guarantee a sale, there's a chance Bob values it slightly higher than $100 and might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it just below our guaranteed price with John ($150) creates a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely, starting at $145 leaves a tiny window for Bob to counter-offer if he's very interested, potentially earning us even more."
