Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$100:**  This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value ($80) but not too high to scare Bob away. 
* **Message:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.  I also highlight the product's value to make it seem attractive. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** I'm starting high, hoping to get as close to my ideal price as possible.
* **Gather information:** Bob's response (acceptance, rejection, counteroffer) will give me valuable insights into his perceived value of the product.
* **Maintain flexibility:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have the option to negotiate further or walk away to John's guaranteed $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** While $80 is my minimum value, I'm not willing to accept it right away.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price. 
* **Reasoning:** I believe there's a chance I can get closer to my desired price ($100) by counter-offering.  Bob's initial rejection and counter-offer show he's interested, but I need to test how far he's willing to go.

**Next Steps:**  I will counter-offer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum value.  I will aim to find a middle ground while still protecting my profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $80 is just a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$90:** This counter-offer is a compromise, meeting halfway between my initial offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($80).  It shows flexibility while still maintaining a decent profit margin.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a positive and conversational tone. I'm emphasizing fairness and suggesting a mutually beneficial outcome.  This helps keep the negotiation constructive and avoids making Bob feel pressured.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding a middle ground:** My counteroffer aims to find a price that is both acceptable to Bob and profitable for me.
* **Testing Bob's willingness to compromise:** I'm seeing if Bob is willing to move slightly higher from his initial offer.  His response will provide further information for the next round of negotiation.
* **Maintaining options:**  I still have the option to accept Bob's $80 offer if his counteroffer is below $90 or to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $85? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's Offer:**  While my ideal price was higher, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer of $85. 
* **Reasoning:**
    * **Profit Margin:**  $85 is still above my minimum value of $80, so I'm making a profit. 
    * **Potential for a Longer Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could potentially drag out the process and increase the risk of Bob losing interest. 
    * **Time Value:**  Accepting the offer now guarantees a sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation rounds.

**Next Steps:** I will finalize the sale with Bob and move on to other potential deals."
