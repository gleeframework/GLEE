Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for potential negotiation and gives me some room to lower the price if needed.  If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter based on his response.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, ensuring I don't fall below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I need to counter and try to bridge the gap. I will continue to negotiate with Bob, but I'll keep John's offer in mind if things don't go as planned."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves me with a decent profit. It also shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to give away the product for a ridiculously low price. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, but I'll be prepared to adjust my offer again if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $600,000 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not ready to sell for that amount. I will continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $900,000. However, I'm keeping John's offer as a safety net, so if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price, I might consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $850,000.  This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum acceptable price.  It's a good move, as it shows Bob I'm serious about negotiating, but I'm not willing to go much lower. Hopefully, this offer will be enough for Bob to accept.  I will be prepared to accept John's offer if Bob continues to decline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, it seems unlikely that we'll reach a price that works for both of us.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer.  It's not ideal, but it guarantees a profit of $800,000 which is my minimum acceptable price.  I'm moving on to John."
