{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This ensures you're still making a profit and allows for potential counteroffers.
* **It's a round number:** This makes it easier for Bob to process and respond to.

I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and while it's tempting to accept, I'm going to hold out for a better deal. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to be closer to my original asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $800,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm trying to be fair, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground. John is always a safe option, but I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob."
