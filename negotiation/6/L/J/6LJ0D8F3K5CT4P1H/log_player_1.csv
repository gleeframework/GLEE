Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000, I'm leaving room for negotiation.  This allows for a potential win-win scenario where we both get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I will counteroffer to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but still staying above my minimum. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, while hopefully still leading to a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum.  I'm confident that I can get a better price by selling to John, so I'll take that option."
