"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm trying to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $11000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10500. Can we meet in the middle?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $10500 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. To make this work, I'm willing to drop my price to $11500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget limit, and I really like the product. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but that's as high as I can go. If we can agree on that price, I'll make the deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
