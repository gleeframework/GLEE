Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. You'll save $200,000, and I'll still get a good price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Why $1,000,000?**  This price is a compromise: it's more than Bob's valuation but less than my minimum. It gives him a good deal and allows me to make a profit.
* **Why the message?** A friendly and clear message builds rapport and highlights the benefits of the deal for Bob. 
* **John as a backup:**  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, so I have a backup buyer who will pay my minimum. This gives me leverage in negotiations."
