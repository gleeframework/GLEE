"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that's worth a significant amount to you. I understand its worth to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its value and potential. Consider this offer:  $1,250,000. This price allows for a fair return for both of us.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product. Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is higher than your maximum price. You can get the product from John for your maximum price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
