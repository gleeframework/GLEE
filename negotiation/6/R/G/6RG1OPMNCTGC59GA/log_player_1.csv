"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $100 for this product. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $100 is quite low. How about we meet in the middle at $160? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here.  While $160 is better, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Could you do $110? That's a significant jump from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal. However, $110 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  My final offer is $140.  This is a great price for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, and $140 is tempting. However, I have a strict budget, and I can't go higher than $115. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to move much higher than $115.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of him lowering his offer or reaching a stalemate.  John offers a guaranteed $150, which is a much better outcome than potentially settling for less with Bob."
