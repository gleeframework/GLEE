"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a decent deal, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,000.  This product is worth $12,000 to you, so I think we can find a price that works for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his target of $8,000. While $9,000 is better than the initial $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $9,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price in the $8,000 range.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,500. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $9250. It's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price, but Alice's offer of $9,250 is still above his comfort zone.  He's already had several rounds of negotiation and Alice doesn't seem likely to budge much further.  

At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John, who offers a guaranteed price of $8,000.  This saves Bob money and avoids further negotiations."
