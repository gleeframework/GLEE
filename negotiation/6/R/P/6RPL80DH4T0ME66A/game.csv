"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This price still leaves me room to make a decent profit, and it's closer to your offer.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $9,000. How about we meet at $9,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're determined to get this product!  While I'm still not comfortable with $9,750, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and it's almost at your price point.  Let's bridge this gap and finalize the deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $9,500 is simply not a price I can accept. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we settle at $10,000?  This is my absolute final offer.  If you're serious about buying the product, I urge you to accept it. Otherwise, I'll have to move on to other options.",10000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you're making a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our previous offers, which is $9,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9250.0,Bob,8,
