Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $200,000 difference where both you and Bob can profit.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but you also don't want to scare Bob away with a price so high he'll reject it.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and exclusivity.
* **Price:** $1,150,000 leaves you with a significant profit margin ($150,000 above your minimum) while still offering Bob a good deal ($50,000 below his perceived value).

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher. If he's more agreeable, this offer is likely a good starting point.
* **Relationship:** A strong existing relationship with Bob might make him more receptive to a higher price.
* **Alternatives:** While you have John as a backup, always consider if there might be other potential buyers out there willing to pay even more.

**Remember:** Negotiation is a back-and-forth process. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and be ready to adjust your strategy accordingly."
