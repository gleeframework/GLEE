{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",

This counteroffer attempts to establish a lower price point while still leaving room for further negotiation. It also expresses continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can do $105. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is coming down, but we're still a bit away from a price I'm fully comfortable with.  Let's see if we can negotiate a little further."

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $98? That's a fair compromise, I think."",

This counter-offer splits the difference between the previous two offers. It shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, $98 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $110, which is my minimum price. I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Alice is sticking to her guns at $110. While it's lower than her original offer, it's not worth continuing to haggle when I can get it for $120 from John. It's not worth the potential for further frustration or the risk of her retracting the offer entirely."
