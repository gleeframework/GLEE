"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and hopefully, we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to consider $1,300,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good return on your investment, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,150,000. This price is fair to both of us, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to stay closer to my target. I'm willing to consider $1,250,000, which is still a bit below my initial offer but reflects the value I believe the product holds. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant compromise for me.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to achieve a favorable outcome. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, which is still a bit higher than your last offer. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,7,
