Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and highlights the value of the product. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The message doesn't come across as overly demanding, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer. 

This approach balances the need to earn as much as possible with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer and forcing me to negotiate further or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $12000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum.** While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept a loss that substantial.
* **Negotiating with Bob is still an option.**  He's shown interest and is willing to pay a decent amount. I can counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **Selling to John is always a possibility.**  John's offer is my safety net. I'll use it as leverage in negotiations with Bob, but only if I can't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $12,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is still a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not accepting his offer but showing flexibility by lowering my price slightly.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I emphasize the product's worth to reiterate why my price is justified.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm still friendly and encouraging negotiation, as I believe a deal is possible.

This counteroffer balances my desire to maximize my earnings with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm glad we're getting closer. However, I still can't exceed $12000 for the product. Could you possibly meet me at that price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is firm on his offer:** He's not budging from $12,000, and I'm not willing to accept a loss that significant.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, which is more important than trying to squeeze out a few extra dollars from Bob. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag on, potentially leading to further price drops or an even longer negotiation process. 

Selling to John offers a quick and reliable solution, securing my desired profit without further risk or delay."
