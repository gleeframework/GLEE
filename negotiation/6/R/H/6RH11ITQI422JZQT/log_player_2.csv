(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is too expensive. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

Let's start with a lowball offer at $1,000,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and it's likely Alice will counter.  We'll see where the negotiations go from here."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice is still too high, but it's getting closer.  Let's continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

Let's increase our offer slightly to $1,100,000. This shows we are serious about buying, but we're still below Alice's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Let's keep pushing for a better price. We're getting closer, but $1,250,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  One more counteroffer before I consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

Let's meet Alice halfway with a counteroffer of $1,150,000.  This is a reasonable compromise, and if Alice isn't willing to budge, we'll go with John."
