Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a lower price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $710000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $720000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $720,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in her price, but she's firm at $720,000. You've already gotten a good discount from the original price of $750,000.  While you might be able to negotiate a little further, it's likely to be a small amount. Accepting the offer guarantees you the product at a good price, and you're still within your budget."
