Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $19,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we meet at $18,500? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,500.

While ideally, I'd like to get closer to $20,000, Bob is consistently coming up in price, and we are getting close to my absolute bottom line. Accepting $18,500 now guarantees a sale at a price significantly better than John's offer.  It's better to secure a solid profit now than risk the negotiation stalling out entirely."
