Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
$950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm confident I can get a better price, and I'm not willing to sell to John just yet.  I'll counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's aim for a quick agreement that benefits both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

$1,000,000 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing this deal with Bob and having to sell to John for less."
