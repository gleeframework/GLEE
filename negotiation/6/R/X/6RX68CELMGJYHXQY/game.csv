"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the description of your product, but $120 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm sticking to my offer of $85.  If we can't agree on that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",85.0,Bob,6,
