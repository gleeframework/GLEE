"Alice, your offer is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, but $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I still need to make a profit. I can do $925,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $910,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this deal.",910000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the bottom line. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options.",920000.0,Alice,7,
