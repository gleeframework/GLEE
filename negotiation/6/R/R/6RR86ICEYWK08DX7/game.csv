"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. To find a middle ground, how about we settle on $1,950,000? This reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a competitive price.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a bigger stretch than I'm comfortable with.  How about $1,350,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value while working within my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,700,000 for this to make sense for me. Would you be willing to consider $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I could potentially do $1,500,000. That's the absolute top of my budget, but I think it's a fair offer considering the market value.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
