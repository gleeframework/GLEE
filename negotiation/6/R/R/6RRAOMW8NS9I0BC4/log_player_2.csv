# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me and the potential benefits it holds for your business.  Let me know what you think!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $12000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10500?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a competitive price on this valuable product. What do you say?
