Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, that starting price is quite high.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price closer to its true market value. How about we start the negotiations at $800,000?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is far below its true value, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. This takes into account your budget and my minimum expectations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price point.  However,  $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I believe that's a fair offer that acknowledges the value of your product while working within my budget."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply not enough to justify the value I'm offering.  Let's meet halfway again.  I'm proposing $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your willingness to negotiate.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving towards a more agreeable price, she's unlikely to drop below $1,000,000 quickly enough. You have a guaranteed option with John at your target price. It makes more sense to secure the product now rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
