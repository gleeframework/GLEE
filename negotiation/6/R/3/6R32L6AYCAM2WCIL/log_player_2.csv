"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and counteroffer.  You're looking to pay no more than $8,000, and Alice's initial offer is above that.  There's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend no more than $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price? "", ""product_price"": 8000}
