Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000** is a good compromise. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $12,000, allowing me to make a profit, but it's also lower than John's offer of $15,000, ensuring I don't lose out on a potentially better deal. 
* The message is friendly and persuasive, highlighting the value for Bob.  

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while also leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters."
