Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think it would be perfect for you, and this is a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum and John's offer. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Creating Urgency:** By calling it a ""special price"" and a ""great deal,"" we subtly imply that this offer won't last forever, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Balancing Profit and Likelihood of Sale:**  While you could aim for a price closer to $150, there's a higher chance Bob will reject it. $125 is a good balance â€“ a significant profit if he accepts, and you still have John as a guaranteed backup."
