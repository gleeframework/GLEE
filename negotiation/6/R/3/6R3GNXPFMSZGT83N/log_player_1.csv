"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider that?

Bob's offer is getting lower and lower. It's not worth risking a lower price than John's offer for a little more profit. I'll sell to John for $10,000."
