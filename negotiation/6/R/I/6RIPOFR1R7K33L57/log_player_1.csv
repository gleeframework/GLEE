{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. I'm willing to come down to $110.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident that I can get a slightly better price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. How about $105?  That's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $105 is the best compromise for me. How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $95. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's getting close to the end of the rounds, and selling to John for $80 wouldn't be a better outcome.  $95 is a good deal for both of us."
