"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You're looking to save as much as possible and $12,000 is still above your limit. You can try to negotiate with Alice or move to John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,500. This is my best offer."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, $10500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11500.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
While $11,500 is closer to your limit, it's still above your comfort zone.  You're better off buying from John for $10,000 and saving the extra $1,500."
