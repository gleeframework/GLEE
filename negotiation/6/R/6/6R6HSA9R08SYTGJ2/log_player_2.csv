"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get closer to his desired price."
