"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $9,500. Let me know if this is something you're interested in!

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to your ideal price, you can still get the product for $8,000 from John. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay right now. I'm willing to offer you $9,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $9,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you're interested in! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

You should choose to buy the product from John.  Even though Alice has come down in price, her final offer of $9,250 is still more than you're willing to pay. You can secure the product for a lower price from John, so that's the best option at this point."
