"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price is fair considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value you'll get from the product while still allowing me to achieve a reasonable return. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think $1,250,000 is a more reasonable price for me. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,250,000 is still quite a bit lower than my minimum. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still not a viable option for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000 as a final compromise. This price allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I want to be clear that if you reject this offer, I'll be looking at other options. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
