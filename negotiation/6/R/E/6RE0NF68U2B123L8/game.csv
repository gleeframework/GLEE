"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about I sell it to you for $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $95? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 might be a bit high, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $95. How about we meet at $102? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",102.0,Alice,5,
