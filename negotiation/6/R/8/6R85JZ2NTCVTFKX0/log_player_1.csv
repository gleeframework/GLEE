"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the value I'll be getting from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $1,000,000 is still too low, considering the value of the product to Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Bob's offer:

You have three options:

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my goal,  $950,000 is still not a good enough price for me. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get a better deal."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,000,000. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Bob has consistently refused to go above $1,000,000. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,000,000 is still above my minimum acceptable offer of $800,000. It's time to accept the offer to secure the deal."
