"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you, as you've indicated it's worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's get this deal done!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can get even closer to my target price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,350,000? This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000, so how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $1,300,000. Let's split the difference, how about $1,325,000?  I think this is a fair compromise that will allow us to close this deal.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,300,000, so how about $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $1,275,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $1,300,000? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise again, so how about $1,290,000?",1290000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close, but $1,290,000 just doesn't work for me. This is my final offer: $1,295,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this will allow us to close the deal. Let's make this happen.",1295000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your final offer, but $1,295,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise one last time, so how about $1,285,000?",1285000.0,Bob,10,
