Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both you (the minimum you'll accept) and Bob, there's room to negotiate above that. Starting high allows for potential negotiation downwards.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value"" to justify the high asking price.
* **Gauge Interest:** This offer serves as a way to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale to John at $1,000,000, ensuring you don't lose out."
