"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the time you're taking to consider my purchase. However, I believe the product is worth less than $2,300,000. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I'm open to negotiations and would like to hear your thoughts.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe my initial offer is closer to the product's true market value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. I'm confident this offer represents a fair deal for both of us.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I still think $2,100,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $2,050,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and our negotiations so far.",2050000.0,Bob,4,
