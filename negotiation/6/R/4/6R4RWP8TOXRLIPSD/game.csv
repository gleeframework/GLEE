,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, I'm looking for something closer to $1,250,000 to make this work for me. This price still gives you a significant saving compared to buying from someone else.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,175,000 is still not quite there for me. Given the product's value and our ongoing negotiations, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a very fair price considering the benefits you'll gain.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to consider other offers.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $1,150,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
