"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I really want to save as much as I can. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you want to save money, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original asking price. How about $1,000,000? This is a fair price for both of us and a good compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept this price, I will have to explore other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
