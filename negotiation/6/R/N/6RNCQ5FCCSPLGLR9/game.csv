"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,500,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. Let me know if this is something you're comfortable with.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
