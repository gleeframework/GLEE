"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit steep for me.  How about $75? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think $75 is a fair price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit high for me. How about $80? I'm very serious about buying this product, and I believe this price would be fair for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
