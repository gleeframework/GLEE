"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  There's plenty of room for negotiation. Accepting now would be a bad deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to be interested.  Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We start with a counteroffer slightly above our walk-away price ($10,000 from John). This gives us room to negotiate but signals that we're serious about a price closer to our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but $14,000 is still significantly more than our fallback option of buying from John. There's still room for negotiation to get closer to our desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that works for me. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $12,500? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 12500
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're splitting the difference between Alice's latest offer ($14,000) and our previous counteroffer ($11,000).  This keeps the negotiation moving and shows Alice we are willing to compromise, but not at the expense of overpaying."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $12,500, which is $13,250. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to sell it to you at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is negotiating in smaller increments now, which is a good sign. However, $13,250 is still a ways off from our ideal price and what John is offering. We'll continue to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $13,250 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $12,800, but that's my absolute limit."",
""product_price"": 12800
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're now making smaller concessions, signaling that we're getting close to our limit. By stating our counteroffer as our ""absolute limit,"" we're applying a bit of pressure for Alice to accept or come down significantly in her next offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,800 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is just $200 above your limit. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to sell it to you at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $13,000 is the closest we've gotten to Alice's original price, we've set a firm limit.  It's time to show Alice we're serious about that limit and willing to walk away.  This might push her to accept our previous offer or a price closer to it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to stick to my budget.  I'm standing by my last offer of $12,800. If you're unable to accept that, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 12800
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We are re-stating our previous offer with a slightly stronger tone, making it clear that this is our final offer. By mentioning ""exploring other options,"" we remind Alice that we have the alternative of buying from John for $10,000.  This puts a bit more pressure on her to decide."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're standing by your last offer, but I'm not willing to accept $12,800. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $13,200, which is the highest price I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is unwilling to meet our price, and we're reaching the end of the negotiation rounds. While $13,200 is a decent price, we have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $10,000. It makes more sense financially to secure the lower price with John, even if it means losing out on a deal with Alice."
