"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find the product to be worth the investment. Let's make this deal happen!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to go to $90. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $90 is still below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle at $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm confident you won't regret this purchase.",95.0,Alice,5,
