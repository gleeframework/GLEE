Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $10,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer allows me (Alice) to gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, I know I might need to come down significantly.  If he counter-offers, it shows he's seriously considering it.
* **Backup Plan:** Since I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, I'm not pressured to accept anything less. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
