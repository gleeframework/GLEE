Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth $1,500,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value is significantly higher than your current offer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. This price reflects the true potential of the product and the return on investment you can expect."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,400,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects a fair balance between the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Explanation:  Bob is consistently lowballing and unwilling to meet near the product's value. It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer means a substantial loss. Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price."
