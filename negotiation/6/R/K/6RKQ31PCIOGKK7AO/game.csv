"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth $1,500,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value is significantly higher than your current offer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. This price reflects the true potential of the product and the return on investment you can expect.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,400,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects a fair balance between the product's value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
