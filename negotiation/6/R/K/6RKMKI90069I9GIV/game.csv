"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. I think it's a fair price considering the value you mentioned it has to you.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800000 is a bit low for me. Considering the value I mentioned earlier, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1100000 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value I mentioned earlier. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're willing to make one more compromise, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'm not comfortable going above $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1025000. I think this is the best we can do, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
