"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $17000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $18500.  This price still reflects the product's value, but also demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. Let me know if this works for you.",18500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $16500?",16500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $16500 is just a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll go down to $17500. This is my final offer, and it reflects the value of the product while still being fair to both of us. What do you say?",17500.0,Alice,5,
