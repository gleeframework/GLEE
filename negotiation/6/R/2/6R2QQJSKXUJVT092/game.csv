"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it, as that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering our previous discussion, how about we set the price at $90?
