"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and we're confident it will meet your needs perfectly. We're currently offering it at $95. Let us know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $100 to you, and Alice's offer is $95, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it, as that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering our previous discussion, how about we set the price at $90? This still allows you to save some money compared to the original price, while ensuring we receive a fair compensation for our product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than my ideal price of $85. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $87.50.  This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. After considering our positions, I believe we can reach an agreement. How about setting the price at $89? This price reflects the value you see in the product and ensures a reasonable profit for us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $89 is only $2 away from my ideal price of $87.50.  Since we're already in round 5, it's likely we'll reach an impasse if I keep rejecting.  It's better to accept this offer and save $11 compared to buying from John."
