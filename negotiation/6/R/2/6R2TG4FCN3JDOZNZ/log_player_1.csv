{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:**  This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also allows for potential profit while remaining competitive.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and positive, framing the offer as a great opportunity for Bob. It also leaves the decision open for negotiation, making Bob feel valued as a potential buyer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** You've successfully sold the product and achieved a good profit.
* **If Bob rejects:** You'll have to gauge his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  While he's showing interest, his offer of $9,500 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible.**  I can counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Selling to John is always an option.** However, I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price with Bob first.  

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than his proposal. This will show I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a reasonable profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,250.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  $11,250 is a compromise between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500.  This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while staying within a profitable range for me.
* **Highlight fairness:** The message emphasizes that the counteroffer is a fair price for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of equity. 
* **Reiterate value:**  By mentioning the value of the product, I subtly remind Bob that he's getting a good deal. 
 
**Next Steps:**  I'll be waiting for Bob's response to this counteroffer.  If he accepts, the deal is done. If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to counter again or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10,750? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While he's increased his offer, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate but not at the cost of sacrificing my profit margin significantly.
* **Negotiation is still possible.**  I can counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Selling to John is always an option.** However, I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price with Bob first.  

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than his proposal. This will show I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a reasonable profit margin."
