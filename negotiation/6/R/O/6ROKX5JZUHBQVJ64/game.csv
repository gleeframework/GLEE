"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really hoping to get this product for $95. Would you be willing to consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 might still be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you working with me.  $100 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still a little tight on my budget.  Would you be willing to do $98?  That's the absolute highest I can go.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $98 is the highest you're willing to go, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $98. I'll sell the product to you for $99.",99.0,Alice,7,
