Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of the product but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This creates space for negotiation, and if Bob rejects, I have room to lower the price slightly while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I will counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am still not comfortable with $11,000. How about $10,000? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still getting a valuable product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I want to see if I can get Bob to budge a bit more before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? This would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see your point, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, $10,500 is a reasonable compromise. I am willing to pay $10,250 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $10,250 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm losing valuable time negotiating with Bob, and John is offering a much better deal. I'm going to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John and avoid any further haggling with Bob."
