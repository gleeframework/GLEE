Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have strong interest from other parties."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have leverage to start with a high offer. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""other parties"" and the product's ""value,"" you create a sense of scarcity and competition, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob, allowing you to potentially settle on a price higher than your minimum. 
 
It's important to remember that this is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's personality and negotiation style, you might adjust your approach."
