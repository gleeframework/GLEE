Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me, I'm looking to get at least $115 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still below what the product is worth to Bob. This gives him some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only able to pay $105 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is more than John's offer, it's still lower than my minimum target. I'm willing to risk a counteroffer from Bob in the hopes of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 isn't quite enough for me. How about we split the difference at $110? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
