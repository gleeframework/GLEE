"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  However, $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's potential benefits. This is my final offer. Let me know your decision.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,500,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,250,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
