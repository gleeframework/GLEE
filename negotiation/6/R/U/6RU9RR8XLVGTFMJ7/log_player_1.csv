Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal with Bob before resorting to selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  However, $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's value.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,500,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,250,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation rounds and potentially lose more time and money.  Selling to John ensures I get my desired price."
