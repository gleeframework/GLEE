"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?  I'm confident you'll find this price very reasonable.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,250 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,500? I really think this product would be a great fit for me, and I'm willing to pay a fair price.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down a little further to $11,000, but that's my final offer.  I think this product is worth it, and I believe you will be happy with your purchase.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $11,000, so I'll offer $10,750. Can you consider that?",10750.0,Bob,6,
