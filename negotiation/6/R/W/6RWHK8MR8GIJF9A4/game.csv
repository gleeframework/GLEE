"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my  constraints and the product's value.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is significantly below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is closer to my budget and a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While $900,000 is closer to what I have in mind, it's still a significant gap. I'm willing to consider $975,000 as my final offer. This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand the value you place on this product, $975,000 remains above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll unfortunately have to consider other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,
