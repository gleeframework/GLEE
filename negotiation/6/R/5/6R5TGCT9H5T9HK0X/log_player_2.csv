# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a price below market value, and I get to close a deal quickly. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,400,000
* **Your Maximum:** $1,200,000
* **John's Offer:** $1,200,000

While Alice's offer is below her product's value to her, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You have a guaranteed option with John at your maximum price.
