"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'd like to make an offer of $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is unfortunately too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm ready to sell the product for $15000. This price still gives you a great deal and allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,3,
