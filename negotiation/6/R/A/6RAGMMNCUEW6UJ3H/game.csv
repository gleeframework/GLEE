"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that price is still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $750,000? I believe that's a fair compromise given the circumstances.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $750,000 is still too far from what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This is a significant compromise, and I truly believe it's the best we can do to find common ground. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable.",850000.0,Alice,5,
