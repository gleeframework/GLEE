**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Even though Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000, Alice's offer of $11,000 saves him $1,000.
* **The offer is within Bob's budget:** The $11,000 price is below Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice for Bob as it allows him to get the product for a lower price than he would pay from John."
