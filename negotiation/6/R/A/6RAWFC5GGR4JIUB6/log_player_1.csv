Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,300,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while staying significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant return on investment"" to justify the high price. 

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, Alice increases her chances of securing a deal that's significantly more profitable than selling to John."
