"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  You can save money by going through a few rounds of counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $125?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I need to make a profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $135 for it. Would you be willing to go up to $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $135 is closer to your goal, it's still higher than what you're comfortable paying.  Continue negotiating to try and lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $130?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad you're still interested in the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bit more than $130. How about $132? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, you've been able to negotiate the price down significantly from Alice's initial offer.  While $132 is still a bit more than your ideal price, it's close enough to make it worthwhile to purchase from Alice.  If you reject this offer, you risk Alice walking away and you'd have to buy from John at a higher price."
