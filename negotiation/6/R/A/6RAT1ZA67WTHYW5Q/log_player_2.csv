# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This price still reflects the value I place on the product, but it's a bit more flexible than my initial offer. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum budget. You're better off continuing to negotiate with Alice to try and get the price down further. There's still room for negotiation, and you're not losing anything by rejecting this offer and trying to get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,285,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer.
