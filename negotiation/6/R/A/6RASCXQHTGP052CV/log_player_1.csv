{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum value for the product.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue discussing this. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm hoping we can reach a more mutually agreeable price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $975,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,012,500?  This would be a fair compromise and would allow us to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 1012500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $990,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product and the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum value.  I've already spent a few rounds negotiating and I'm running out of time.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than risk getting a lower price from Bob."
