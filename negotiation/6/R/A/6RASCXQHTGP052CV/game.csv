"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue discussing this. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to both walk away satisfied.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the value I can get from the product.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $975,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,012,500?  This would be a fair compromise and would allow us to move forward with the sale.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $990,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product and the market value.",990000.0,Bob,6,
