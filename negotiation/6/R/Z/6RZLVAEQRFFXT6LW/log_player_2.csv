"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially pricing it at $18,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's initial offer is far too high.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is definitely out of my price range. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $8,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. To be fair to both of us, I can go down to $15,000.  This reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high.  While she's come down from her initial price, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product while still leaving some room for negotiation. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate you moving closer to a feasible price.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $12,000.  I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to be realistic.  How about we settle at $13,000? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has lowered her price again, $13,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm going to counteroffer once more in hopes of finding a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your situation, and I'm willing to go a little higher. However, $13,000 is still too much for me. I'm prepared to offer $11,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on it and your need to make a profit. I believe we can reach an agreement at this price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
