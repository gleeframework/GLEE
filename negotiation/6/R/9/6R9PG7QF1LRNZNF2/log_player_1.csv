Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit margin of $300,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000) if you can get Bob to pay his maximum.

**The Strategy**

You want to start high but leave room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're starting above Bob's valuation, giving you room to negotiate.
* **Justification:**  You're not just throwing out a number; you're framing it as a ""fair deal"" and highlighting the product's value (even though you haven't explicitly stated what the product is).
* **Exclusivity:** Creating a sense of scarcity and importance might make Bob more inclined to act quickly.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You make a great profit of $150,000 more than your fallback option.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  You have room to come down slightly in price while still staying above your minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** You move on to John and secure your guaranteed $1,500,000."
