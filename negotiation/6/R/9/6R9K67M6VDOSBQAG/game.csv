"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be really valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm happy to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to consider $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position.  I can go down to $15,500, but that's my final offer. It's a great price for a product like this.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your understanding. While that's closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you possibly do $14,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,6,
