Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be really valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm happy to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to consider $13,500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position.  I can go down to $15,500, but that's my final offer. It's a great price for a product like this."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your understanding. While that's closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you possibly do $14,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation:  Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $14,000.  It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John than to risk Bob walking away in the remaining rounds."
