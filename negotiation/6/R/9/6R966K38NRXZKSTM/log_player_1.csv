"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm looking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($120) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:** Since the product is worth $80 to Bob, it's likely he'll find this price too high, opening up room for counteroffers and a potential win-win scenario. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message simple and friendly, inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $150 is a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I'm not willing to sell for such a low price, but I'm open to further negotiation.
* **Strategic rejection:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate and that there's still room for a better price.

**Next steps:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:** $125 is still above Bob's perceived value but significantly less than my initial offer, giving him an incentive to accept.
* **Staying firm:** I'm not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $110. It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to the minimum:** While $110 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Staying strategic:** I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum yet, but I want to see if I can push Bob higher.
* **Negotiation:** I'm confident I can secure a better price with a counteroffer.

**Next steps:**

I will send a counteroffer in the next round, trying to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's meet in the middle at $115.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final compromise:** This is my final compromise. I'm offering a price that's slightly above Bob's last offer, showing that I'm still willing to negotiate but also that I have a limit. 
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this is a fair price for both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Urgency:** By suggesting that this is a ""final offer"", I'm adding a slight sense of urgency, hoping to motivate Bob to accept.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll still have time to make another counteroffer, but I'll be prepared to sell to John for $120 if this doesn't work out."
