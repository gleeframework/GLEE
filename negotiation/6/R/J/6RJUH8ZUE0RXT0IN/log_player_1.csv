Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is too low for me to consider.  Could you do $18,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but I really can't go above $12,000. I'd like to reiterate my previous offer of $12,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $12,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is unwilling to budge from his $12,000 offer, and it's unlikely he'll go higher.  It's a loss compared to John's guaranteed offer.  It's time to move on."
