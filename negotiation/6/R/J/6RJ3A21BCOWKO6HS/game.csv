"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1200000 is a tempting offer, I'm not quite ready to let go of the product at that price. How about we split the difference and settle at $1350000? This would still leave you with a significant advantage, and it would allow me to move forward with this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
