Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit.  However, I'm willing to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my ideal selling price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit. This counteroffer shows flexibility while also demonstrating my firm commitment to achieving a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's counteroffers are consistently below my minimum.  At this point, selling to John guarantees me the $800,000 I consider the product's minimum value, minimizing the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
