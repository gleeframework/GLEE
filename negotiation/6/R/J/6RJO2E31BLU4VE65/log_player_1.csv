"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value, aiming to maximize my profit.  I believe Bob might be willing to pay a bit more, considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to him.  However, I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what the product is worth to him, it's significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that doesn't meet my needs. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum value and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly from the initial offer, but it's still above my minimum.  I'm hoping that Bob sees this as a good faith effort and will be willing to meet me halfway.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. Although it's a slight increase, I'm not yet convinced that I should settle. I want to see if we can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer, but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum value.  I'm hoping this offer is enticing enough for Bob to accept, as it's still above my minimum and a reasonable compromise. If he rejects, I'll have to consider seriously selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is finally above my minimum value of $1,500,000. While I'd prefer a higher price,  I've already rejected several offers and don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and ensures that I get at least my minimum desired price."
