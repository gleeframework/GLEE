"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth $10,000. Would you be interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and try to get a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While I'm willing to pay up to $12,000, it's strategically better to start with a lower counteroffer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a fair deal.
* **Not Too Low:**  Offering $8,500 is a significant jump down from Alice's $10,000, but it's not offensively low considering her value is $8,000. It gives her room to counter while showing I'm serious about purchasing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering the value you place on the product, I am willing to negotiate further. How about $9,200 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $9,200 is still a bit too high. We're getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, so I'll continue negotiating.  I'm aiming to get the price closer to $8,000, but I'm willing to compromise slightly to avoid reaching John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  $9,200 is getting closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $8,800? That would work well for me."",
""product_price"": 8800
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate by moving closer to her price. A $400 reduction from my previous offer is a reasonable step.
* **Staying Firm:**  While I'm increasing my offer, I'm not going above $9,000 yet. This keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further, especially since I have John's option as a backup. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and appreciative tone encourages a collaborative negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. After considering our conversation, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's agree on $8,950 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $8,950 is a solid price, saving me $3,050 from John's offer and $1,050 from Alice's initial offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a chance Alice might not budge much further. Accepting now guarantees a good deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down. 
* **Time:** We're past the halfway point of the rounds, and securing the deal now gives me peace of mind."
