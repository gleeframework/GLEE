Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get, rather than focusing on my own needs. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message indicates I'm open to discussing the price further. 

This approach aims to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to consider the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for higher price:**  While I could accept his offer and secure a sale, I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  If I can't secure a better price with Bob, I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, making this a safe option.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and can potentially increase the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still quite a bit below what I need. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would give us both a fair deal.  Let's keep talking!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair deal"" for both of us.
* **Continued negotiation:** The message encourages Bob to keep discussing the price, signaling that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable solution. 

This approach aims to find a middle ground while staying above my minimum acceptable price and maintaining the potential for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a fair deal, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $9,800 is closer to my minimum acceptable price than Bob's previous offers, it's still significantly below my desired value.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** Bob's message indicates he's unlikely to go higher, making further negotiation unproductive.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.

Given the current situation, selling to John is the most logical decision as it provides a significantly higher profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
