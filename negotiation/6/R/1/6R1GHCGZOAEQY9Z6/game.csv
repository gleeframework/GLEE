"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $85 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $95 to try and make this work.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price.  $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $90 and I think that's a fair compromise. ",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a lower price, but $90 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $92.50. This feels like a fair price that respects both our positions. What do you say?",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $91.  This feels like a fair price and would allow us to close the deal.",91.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $91 is still a little lower than I need to be at this point.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $91.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",91.5,Alice,7,
