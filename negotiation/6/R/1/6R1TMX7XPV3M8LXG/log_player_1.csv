{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer allows me to make a significant profit while still leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept it, but if not, I'm prepared to counteroffer or sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit out of my range right now.  How about $12000?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is a decent profit, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price range of $14,000. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is still a bit low for me. How about $13,000? This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
