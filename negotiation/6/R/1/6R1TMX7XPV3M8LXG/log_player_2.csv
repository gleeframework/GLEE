"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's desired price range. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the logical choice to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit out of my range right now.  How about $12,000?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12000 is still a bit low for me. How about $13000? This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $13,000 is less than Bob's maximum price of $15,000. 
* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** While Bob could buy from John for $15,000, Alice's offer of $13,000 is a better deal.
* **Alice has indicated this is her final offer:** This means further negotiation could lead to a stalemate, leaving Bob with no option other than buying from John at a higher price.

Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer and secure the product for $13,000."
