Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  While we know Bob's perceived value is lower, opening with a price above his valuation leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's ""value,"" we subtly anchor the price in Bob's mind to a higher point.
* **Alternative Option:** Highlighting the ""public listing"" creates a subtle sense of urgency and potential competition.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""open to discussing"" signals flexibility and encourages Bob to engage, even if the initial price seems high. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:** If Bob accepts the initial price or a negotiated price close to it.
2. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will indicate how much he's willing to pay.
3. **Secure a Sale:** Even if Bob counters with a lower offer, it opens the door for a deal that could still be significantly higher than John's guaranteed $15,000."
