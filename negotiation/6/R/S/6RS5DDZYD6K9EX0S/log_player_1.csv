{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $850,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's fair considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's slightly higher than what the product is worth to you, but still lower than what it's worth to Bob. This creates some room for negotiation while still maximizing your potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $800,000.  This is still a great price for you considering the value of the product, and it's fair for me.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}
