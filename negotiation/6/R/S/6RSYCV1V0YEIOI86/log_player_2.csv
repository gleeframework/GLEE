"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $700,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** It's a significant discount from your maximum budget, but there's still room for negotiation.
* **It's early in the game.**  It's always worth trying to get a better deal, especially since you have 10 rounds to work with. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  It's good to know that you have this option, but it's not the best deal available right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $700,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 650000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save a bit more, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $675,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is fair.** It's a decent compromise that reflects both our desired prices. 
* **Time is ticking.**  It's getting closer to having to buy from John, which is less desirable.
* **The potential savings are significant.**  At $675,000, I'm saving $125,000 compared to buying from John."
