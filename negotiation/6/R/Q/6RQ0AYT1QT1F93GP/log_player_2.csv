"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's worth at least $120 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. This is a great deal for you, as it's less than what you value it at.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
