"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000. This is still a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of this product. Let's see if we can work this out.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000? This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up in price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $1,087,500?  This is a fair price that considers both of our positions, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!",1087500.0,Alice,5,
