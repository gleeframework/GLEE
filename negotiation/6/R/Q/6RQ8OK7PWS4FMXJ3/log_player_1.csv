"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $2,000,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin significantly above Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This provides room for negotiation and establishes the product's high value in Bob's mind.
* **Confident Tone:** By expressing confidence in the offer's value, we aim to influence Bob's perception and potentially secure a favorable counter-offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price signals willingness to negotiate but keeps us far from settling below our minimum.

This strategy aims to maximize our potential profit while gauging Bob's interest and flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above his perceived value but still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While tempting, I have room to negotiate and try to bridge the gap. Selling to John at this point would be the safe option, but I believe I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer and understand your perspective on the value. This product offers unique advantages, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,700,000."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, but Firm:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and willingness to negotiate by decreasing my price significantly. However, the decrease is calculated to keep me above my $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the product's unique benefits to justify the higher price point, aiming to shift Bob's focus from his perceived value towards the potential gains.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counter-offer maintains a firm position but shows flexibility. It allows room for Bob to potentially counter again while still leaving me the option to accept John's offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit of $100,000 above my fallback option (selling to John). It's a strong deal, and prolonging the negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome."
