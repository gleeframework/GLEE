"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in your product, but $13,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'd be willing to pay $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,250?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it's a price I can accept. Let me know your thoughts.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is my absolute maximum.  If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal.  Let me know your decision.",12000.0,Bob,4,
