"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in your product, but $13,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'd be willing to pay $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,500 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $12,000. I'm confident I can do better in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,250?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it's a price I can accept. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is my absolute maximum.  If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal.  Let me know your decision. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me.  While I'd like to get a little more, Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  It's better to close now than to keep negotiating and potentially have to sell to John for the same amount."
