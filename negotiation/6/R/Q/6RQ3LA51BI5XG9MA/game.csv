"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business or personal endeavors. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2000000 is far outside my budget. While I recognize the potential of this product, I'm only able to offer $500000 at this time.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the market value and my willingness to acquire it.",500000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $500000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for this exceptional product. Considering the value it could bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1800000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects its true worth while still being a good deal for you.",1800000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1800000 is still above what I can realistically afford. To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $700000. This is a significant commitment for me, and I believe it's a fair price given my budget and the potential value of the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement here.",700000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to make a serious commitment to acquiring this product. However, I'm still not comfortable selling it to you for $700000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you at a price of $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price that reflects the product's true value, and I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.",1500000.0,Alice,5,,
