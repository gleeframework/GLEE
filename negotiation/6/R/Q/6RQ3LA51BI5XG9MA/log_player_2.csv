Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $500000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for this exceptional product. Considering the value it could bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1800000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects its true worth while still being a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

Alice's offer is still too high. While she's come down from her initial price, $1,800,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but it's important to remember that I have a backup option with John at $800,000."

I'm hoping we can reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 700000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to make a serious commitment to acquiring this product. However, I'm still not comfortable selling it to you for $700000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you at a price of $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price that reflects the product's true value, and I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.

Alice is still too high. Although she's made compromises, her price is still significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  It's time to take the sure thing and buy from John for $800,000."
