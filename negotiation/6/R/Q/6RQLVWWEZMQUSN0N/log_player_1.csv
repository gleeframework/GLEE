"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While I'm aiming for the highest price, this offer is still below my absolute minimum. This allows for some give-and-take during the negotiations. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the first offer. I'll need to carefully observe Bob's reactions and adjust my strategy based on his responses in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial assessment, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Selling to John is a Safe Option:**  While I'm aiming to get the best possible price, selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed way to meet my minimum requirement.  I'll keep this option in mind as the negotiation progresses.

**Next Steps:**  In the next round, I'll need to carefully consider my counteroffer to Bob. I need to balance finding a price that's acceptable to him with maximizing my profits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low.  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000? This price reflects the true value of the product, and it would be a great deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's significantly closer to Bob's offer than my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's true value, aiming to make him feel that $1,000,000 is a fair price considering its worth to him.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using a positive tone and highlighting the benefits of this deal for both of us.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move.  By meeting Bob halfway, I'm trying to encourage him to accept the deal while still securing a price that meets my minimum requirement. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to carefully consider my options:

* **Lower the Price Slightly:** If I'm confident Bob is serious about buying, I might lower the price by a small amount in the next round. 
* **Sell to John:** If Bob continues to reject my offers, selling to John for $1,000,000 becomes a more attractive option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob is steadfast in his offer of $850,000, which is below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of Further Negotiations:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to further rounds of back-and-forth without any guarantee of a higher price. There's also a risk of him walking away entirely.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees I meet my minimum requirement and earn a decent profit. 

**Conclusion:**

Given the stalemate in negotiations and the opportunity to secure a guaranteed profit with John, it's the most logical choice to sell to John. I'm willing to sacrifice a slightly higher potential price for the certainty of a deal."
