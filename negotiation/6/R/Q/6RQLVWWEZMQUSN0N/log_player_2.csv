Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low.  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000? This price reflects the true value of the product, and it would be a great deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
