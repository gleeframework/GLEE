"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low.  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000? This price reflects the true value of the product, and it would be a great deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
