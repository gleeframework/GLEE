Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being higher than my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and consider whether it's worth continuing the negotiation or if I should cut my losses and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price that is fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $125. While I'd ideally get closer to my initial asking price, this is still a decent profit and better than selling to John for $100. Continuing the negotiation with Bob risks lowering the price further, and I don't want to lose out on a good opportunity."
