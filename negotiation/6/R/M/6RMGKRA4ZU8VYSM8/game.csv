"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Could we settle around $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $700,000. Would that be feasible?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $850,000. It's the lowest I can go without losing too much profit.",850000.0,Alice,5,
