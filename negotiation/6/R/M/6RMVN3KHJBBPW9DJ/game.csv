"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $140? This is a fair price that considers both our needs.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $140 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you at $130. Can you consider that?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a little further, but $130 still feels a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $135? I think this is a fair compromise for both of us.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'd be willing to go up to $125. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?,125.0,Bob,6,
