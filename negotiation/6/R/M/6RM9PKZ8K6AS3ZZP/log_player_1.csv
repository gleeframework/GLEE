Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is higher than my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob is interested enough to counteroffer, allowing us to find a price that works for both of us.  If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and either accept it or propose a new price. However, if the negotiations stall, I have John as a guaranteed buyer, ensuring I don't lose out on the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum, and while I could accept it, I'd prefer to see if I can get a bit more. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm offering $175. It's a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer.  Hopefully, this is a fair price that we can both agree on. If Bob rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as I'm nearing my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd like to continue negotiating, I'm getting close to my minimum value.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob. John is a guaranteed buyer at $150, which is a safer choice at this point."
