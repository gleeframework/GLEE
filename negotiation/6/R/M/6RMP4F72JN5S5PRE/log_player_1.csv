Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a classic negotiation tactic where you start high to leave room for negotiation. By aiming high, you might be able to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay, while still having the option to lower the price later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer matches John's, there's still room for negotiation to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns. How about we meet in the middle at $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

Here's why this is a good strategy:

* **Shows willingness to negotiate:**  By lowering the price, you demonstrate flexibility and a desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Aims for a higher price:** While closer to Bob's offer, it still leaves room for further negotiation if Bob is completely set on $100. 
* **Avoids a stalemate:**  Going straight to John's offer might make Bob walk away, while this keeps the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $110 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is now offering $110, which is a profit of $10 over John's guaranteed price. It's getting close to a point where further negotiation might not yield much more, and there's a risk of Bob losing interest. Accepting now secures a decent profit."
