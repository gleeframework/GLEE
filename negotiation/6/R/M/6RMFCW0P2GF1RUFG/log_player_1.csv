"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product, and I think you'd be very interested in it. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and optimistic message sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to engage. 
* **Open Ended:**  The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and allows him to counteroffer if he wishes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, I am not comfortable with the price of $10000. Could we discuss a more reasonable price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball Offer:** Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price. While I could accept it, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get a higher price.
* **Potential for Upward Negotiation:**  There's a chance that Bob is willing to pay more, but he's testing the waters with a low offer. 
* **Preserving Options:** Rejecting allows me to maintain the option of selling to John if the negotiation fails to yield a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, but I'm firm on that. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Firm Stance:** I'm indicating that I'm serious about this price and am not willing to go lower. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm still open to discussion and encourage Bob to counteroffer if he wants to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting the price. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my research and understanding of the market, I believe a fair price would be around $8500. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progressing Negotiation:** Bob's offer is a significant improvement from his initial $8,000 offer. He's clearly willing to pay more, and this shows he values the product.
* **Value vs. Time:** While I could try to push for a higher price, it's likely Bob won't go much higher.  Accepting his offer secures a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation. 
* **Time Factor:** We're already in round 4, and I need to balance earning a good price with the risk of the deal falling through."
