Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000. 
* **My minimum:** I need at least $12,000. 
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed sale for $12,000, which provides a safety net.

By offering $14,000, I am:

* **Maximizing my profit:** I'm aiming for a higher profit than the guaranteed $12,000 from John.
* **Offering a good deal to Bob:**  He gets the product for a price lower than his maximum, potentially making him happy with the deal.

This strategy balances my desire for a high price with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
