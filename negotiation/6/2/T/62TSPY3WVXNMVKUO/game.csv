"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Would you consider $9500? I'm confident this would be a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
