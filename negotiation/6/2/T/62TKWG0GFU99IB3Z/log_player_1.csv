Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 12000} 

I'm starting with a price that's a good middle ground between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This allows for some negotiation while still ensuring a profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's closer. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm offering $11,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves room for a bit of negotiation. I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's initial offer and my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough.  While I'd like to get more, it's getting late in the negotiation and I'm not sure how much further Bob will go. To guarantee a profit, I'll sell to John for $8,000."
