This takes into account your budget and still allows me to make a fair profit. I believe this is a good compromise and a good opportunity for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

This is a fair compromise considering both our needs and I believe we can both walk away satisfied with this deal.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
