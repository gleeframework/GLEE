"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to come down to that price? ",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? That's a significant discount from my original asking price.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $140 is still outside my budget.  Would you consider $100? It's a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to get a great deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  How about $120?  That's my final offer.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110. Let's split the difference and make a deal.",110.0,Bob,6,
