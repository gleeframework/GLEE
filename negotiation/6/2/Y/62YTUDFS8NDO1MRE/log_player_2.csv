"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $200 is far above your maximum budget of $80.  It's best to reject and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $200 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to come down to that price? "", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a bold move, immediately stating your maximum budget. It's a clear signal that you're serious about buying, but not willing to pay significantly more than your limit. It's a good starting point for negotiations, and hopefully, Alice will be willing to negotiate from here."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? That's a significant discount from my original asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is a significant discount, it's still above your budget.  It's important to continue negotiating and see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $140 is still outside my budget.  Would you consider $100? It's a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a compromise from both sides. It's higher than your initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate, but still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer. It's a middle ground that could potentially lead to an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  How about $120?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your desired price point. There is room for further negotiation. You should try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110. Let's split the difference and make a deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, increasing your offer slightly but still staying within your budget. It shows Alice that you're serious about buying but also want a fair deal."
