Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $900000 is significantly lower than my initial offering, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to sell for $1100000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

**Explanation:**
