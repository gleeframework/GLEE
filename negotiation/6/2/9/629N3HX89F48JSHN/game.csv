"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $10,500. Is that something you'd be interested in?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,250 just yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. How about we meet at $10,000? I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, like a free warranty and premium support.",10000.0,Alice,5,
