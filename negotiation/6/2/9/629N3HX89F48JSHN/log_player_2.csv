Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $10,500. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,250 just yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. How about we meet at $10,000? I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, like a free warranty and premium support. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to your maximum price.  While you *could* try to negotiate her down further, there's no guarantee she'll go lower and you risk her withdrawing the offer altogether. You can always accept the ""extras"" at face value even if they don't hold immense value for you."
