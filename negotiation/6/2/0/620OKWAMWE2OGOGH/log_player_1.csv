Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** There's a large difference between what the product is worth to you ($15,000) and what it's worth to Bob ($8,000). This means there's room for negotiation.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer for $15,000 allows you to be more aggressive with your pricing.
* **Compromise:** $12,000 is a compromise price that's still significantly more than what it's worth to Bob, while giving you a decent profit.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message highlights the potential savings for Bob, making the offer more appealing."
