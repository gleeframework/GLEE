"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in. It's something that I value at no less than $15,000, and I know it's worth that much to you as well. I'm willing to offer it to you for $17,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $17,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $15,000 and higher than John's offer. By rejecting her offer, you can pursue a better deal with John."
