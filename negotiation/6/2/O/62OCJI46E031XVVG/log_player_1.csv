"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob (""amazing"", ""you'll love"") to make the offer more enticing.
* **Open Ended:** The message ends with a question to encourage Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($100).**  Accepting it would be a significant loss.
* **There are still 9 rounds left.** This gives me ample time to try and negotiate a better price with Bob.
* **Selling to John guarantees $100.** While this is a safe option, I believe I can potentially get a better price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the offer. $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not by too much.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly to encourage Bob to keep negotiating.
* **Emphasis on Finding a Solution:** I'm focusing on finding a compromise to show I'm willing to work with Bob. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** $90 is still above my minimum price, so it's a good starting point for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation Room:** While $75 is closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room to negotiate.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target.
* **Time to Sell to John:**  I'm getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds. If I can't get a better price, selling to John at $100 is a safer option than accepting a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $75 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $85? That's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing to meet Bob halfway, demonstrating a willingness to find a middle ground.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer for both of us. 
* **Focus on Shared Benefit:** I'm suggesting a win-win scenario that benefits both parties.
* **Closer to Minimum:** This offer is still above my minimum price of $80, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I could do $78, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $78 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I'm close to my minimum, but I believe there's a chance Bob might be willing to go slightly higher. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to be cautious but not settle for a price significantly below my target. 
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $100 is a tempting option, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a better price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  Let's try to meet in the middle.  How about $82? It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 82}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm again proposing to split the difference, showing I'm committed to finding a compromise.
* **Fairness:**  I'm highlighting the fairness of the offer for both parties. 
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm emphasizing the potential to close the deal by making a reasonable offer.
* **Close to Minimum:** This offer is just above my minimum price of $80, but I believe it's a strong chance to reach a deal with Bob."
