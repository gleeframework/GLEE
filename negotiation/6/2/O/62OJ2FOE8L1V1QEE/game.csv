,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $165. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $165 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product and would be happy to pay $135.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to meet you at $155, which is my absolute lowest price. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to make a deal at this price. Let me know what you think.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really interested in the product, but $155 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to pay $145, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $155 and $145, which is $150. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",150.0,Alice,7,
