"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000 for a product like this. Would you be open to something in that range?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I could be flexible, but I can't go below $13,000. This product offers a lot of unique advantages, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I agree there is value in the product, $13,000 is still outside my budget. Could we meet halfway at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
