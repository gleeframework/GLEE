"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $140 for the product.  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable selling for $140. I'm willing to meet you at $155, which is a bit higher than your offer, but still a compromise from my initial price of $180. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
