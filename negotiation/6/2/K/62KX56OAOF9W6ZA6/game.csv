,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $9000 is a bit lower than I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $12500? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my costs and the value of the product. I can do $12000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, let's talk about the details.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm getting close to my minimum price. I can do $11500, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",11500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $11500. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to my minimum price, Bob. However, I still want to try to find a mutually beneficial solution. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, let's talk about the details.",11000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $11000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000.",9500.0,Bob,10,
