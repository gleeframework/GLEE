"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Positive Message:** A friendly message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:**  I highlight the potential benefit to Bob to entice him to accept."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's a step closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Potential for counteroffer:** I believe I can still secure a better price. 
* **Time to counter:** Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round, potentially getting closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $92.50? That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** I emphasize the ""fair deal"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Still above minimum:** $92.50 is still above my minimum price, allowing me to potentially make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $88.50 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a slight compromise, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
