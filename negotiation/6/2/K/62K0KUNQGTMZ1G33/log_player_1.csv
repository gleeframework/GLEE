Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but we have a buffer before reaching our minimum acceptable price.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While we want to maximize profit, asking for $999,999 might seem unreasonable and deter Bob.  $925,000 positions the offer as a potential win-win.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. There's always an element of risk, as Bob could outright reject the offer."
