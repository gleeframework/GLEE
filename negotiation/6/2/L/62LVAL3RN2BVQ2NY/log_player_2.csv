"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1200000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1100000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $950000 is a good offer, I'm still a bit away from my target.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price reflects the product's value and gives us both a chance to secure a beneficial deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to $1,000,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's finalize the deal at this price.  "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
