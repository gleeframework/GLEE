Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be of great value to you.  I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit higher, but still ensures a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net. This allows Alice to confidently aim higher with Bob."
