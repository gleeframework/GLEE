"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $11000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $13000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $13000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to counter with $12000. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,4,
