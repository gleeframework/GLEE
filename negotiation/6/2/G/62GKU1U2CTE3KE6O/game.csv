"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob, but I have to make a living too. Considering the product's value to me is higher than $900000, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but not quite all the way. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $950000? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my means.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your budget, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $1050000 is the lowest I can go. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. If you're still interested, I'm open to negotiating, but I need you to meet me at $1050000. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
