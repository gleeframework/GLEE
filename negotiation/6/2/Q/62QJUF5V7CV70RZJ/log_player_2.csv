# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $15000 is a bit too low for me at this time.  However, I'm willing to come down to $18000. It's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this opportunity.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.
