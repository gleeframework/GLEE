Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in.  It's a unique opportunity and I believe it could be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This allows room for negotiation and leaves more potential profit.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product for Bob, which might encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm using open-ended language like ""What do you think?"" to signal that I'm open to negotiation.

This initial offer establishes a high starting point and sets the stage for a potential back-and-forth negotiation.  I'll be prepared to adjust my offer based on Bob's response and the information I gather about his interest and valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $20000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'd be happy to purchase it for $15000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to settle.  I'd like to see if I can secure a higher price through further negotiation. 

* **Potential for a higher price:** There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more, especially if he's genuinely interested.
* **Gaining information:**  By rejecting his offer, I can gauge his level of interest and willingness to negotiate.
* **Leveraging John's offer:** Having John as a backup buyer at $15,000 gives me a safety net.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I open the door to a potential counteroffer from Bob, which might lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $15,000 is a bit too low for me at this time.  However, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. It's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this opportunity.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm proposing a price that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility while still trying to maximize my profit.
* **Highlighting value again:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential value and the significant reduction from my initial price. 
* **Open to negotiation (again):** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion by using language like ""Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.""

This counteroffer provides a more concrete price point while also allowing space for potential negotiation depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $18000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go to $16500.  This is a good price for both of us and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $16,500 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and a decent step closer to my ideal price.  

* **Significant profit:**  $16,500 is a good profit for me, especially considering I'm willing to sell to John for $15,000. 
* **Potential for future deals:**  Accepting this offer might strengthen the relationship with Bob and open the door for future deals where I might be able to secure even better prices. 

While further negotiation might lead to a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal altogether outweighs the potential for a few hundred dollars more.  Accepting this offer ensures a successful transaction and a good profit."
