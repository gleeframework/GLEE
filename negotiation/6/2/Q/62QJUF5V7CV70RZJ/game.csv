"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $20000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'd be happy to purchase it for $15000.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $15000 is a bit too low for me at this time.  However, I'm willing to come down to $18000. It's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this opportunity.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $18000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go to $16500.  This is a good price for both of us and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",16500.0,Bob,4,
