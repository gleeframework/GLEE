Round 7
Alice's offer:

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield smaller and smaller concessions from Alice. You've already gotten her down $125,000, and another round or two might only net you another $25,000 at most.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Each round you spend negotiating with Alice is a round you're not exploring other options (even though John's price isn't ideal). 
* **Reasonable Price:** $1,075,000 is still a significant savings over John's $1,500,000 price.

While you could try to squeeze a little more out of Alice, it's becoming riskier as you approach your walk-away point. Accepting now secures a good deal."
