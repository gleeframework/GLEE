"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I see the value, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we settle at $1,000,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and I'm serious about buying this product.  However, $1,050,000 is pushing my budget. My absolute final offer is $1,025,000. If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really committed to this purchase, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but that's my absolute limit. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
