Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is quite high. While I'm interested in the product, I'm only willing to pay $800000 for it. This is a significant price reduction, but it's the maximum I can afford at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,200,000?  That would be a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1200000 is still too high for me.  Let's find some middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit higher before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $900,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $1,050,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to reach a mutually agreeable conclusion. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  we're getting closer.  $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $950000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to finalize the deal. Let's find a way to come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. We're getting close with Bob, but the negotiations are taking longer than I expected. With John, I can secure a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is close enough to my minimum and will save me time and effort."
