{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high. It's a good starting point for negotiation, but I'm going to reject it and counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is quite high. While I'm interested in the product, I'm only willing to pay $800,000 for it. This is a significant price reduction, but it's the maximum I can afford at this time."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $800000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $1200000?  That would be a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer is still too high. While she's come down a bit, it's still well above my budget. I'll reject her offer and try to get closer to my target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  Let's find some middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $900000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $1050000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to reach a mutually agreeable conclusion. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
