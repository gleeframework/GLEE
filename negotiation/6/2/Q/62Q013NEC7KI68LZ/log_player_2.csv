Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product seems great, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you and the potential benefits it offers.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000.

It's worth trying to get a lower price. You're still only a small amount away from your goal and John is a good backup option."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Alice is getting closer to your target price, but you only have a few rounds left. To guarantee you get the product within your budget, it's best to buy from John. You're saving $55,000 compared to Alice's offer, and it's less risky than potentially getting stuck with a higher price in the remaining rounds."
