"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
Alice's offer is a starting point, but there's room for negotiation. While $1,150,000 isn't a terrible price, it's worth seeing if you can get it lower before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?"", ""product_price"": 1075000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This approach aims to find a compromise quickly. 
* **Significant Reduction:**  The counteroffer is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price, signaling that I'm serious about getting a better deal.
* **Still Above Alice's Value:**  The offer is still significantly above Alice's perceived value, giving her room to potentially make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, but we still have room to work with.  Her counteroffer of $1,100,000 shows she's willing to move on price. We can push a little further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $1,090,000? That's a fair offer that brings us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1090000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise by meeting Alice closer to the middle of the remaining price gap. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer tests Alice's flexibility. If she's firm on $1,100,000, we'll know to consider John's offer more seriously. If she's willing to budge further, we can potentially secure a better deal."
