Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,150,000 is higher than your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room for him to counteroffer and for you to potentially meet in the middle. 
* **It shows you're serious about selling:** By offering a specific price, you're demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. 

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to you. Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is a compromise:** This offer shows you're willing to negotiate, but you're still holding out for a higher price than Bob's initial counteroffer. 
* **Still above your minimum:** $1,100,000 is still higher than your minimum of $1,000,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's still within Bob's range:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so $1,100,000 is still within a reasonable price range for him to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $1,090,000? That's a fair offer that brings us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,090,000 is very close to your previous counteroffer of $1,100,000.  While it's still not your ideal price, it's a significant improvement over John's offer of $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer secures a sale and a reasonable profit.  It also avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price."
