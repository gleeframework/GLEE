Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  It also demonstrates the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
 
While $1,100,000 is a good price, I'm confident I can do better. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and further negotiation might not result in a significantly better offer. I'd rather lock in a sale at this price than risk another rejection and potentially end up selling to John for less."
