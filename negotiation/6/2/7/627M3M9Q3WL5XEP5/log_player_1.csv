"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, but it also signals that I value the product significantly.  I'll see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$8,000 is way too low.  The product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and I'm not desperate to sell.  I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $16,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise.  It's also close enough to my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) that I'm not risking too much by rejecting his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$10,000 is still below my minimum, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $14,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still within my acceptable range.  I'm hoping Bob sees this as a genuine attempt to meet in the middle and will be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$12,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I still think I can get a little more.  I'll counteroffer one last time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $13,000.  This is a small compromise from my previous offer, but it shows I'm serious about closing the deal. With only 3 rounds left, I want to make sure I'm not leaving any money on the table."
