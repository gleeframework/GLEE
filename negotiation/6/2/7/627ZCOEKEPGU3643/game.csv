"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit shy of that number. I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split the difference. I'll accept $1,275,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on it, and it's closer to what I need. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
