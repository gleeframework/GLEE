Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I can only afford to pay up to $1,150,000. Let me know if this is something you can consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. $1,150,000 is too far below my minimum, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
