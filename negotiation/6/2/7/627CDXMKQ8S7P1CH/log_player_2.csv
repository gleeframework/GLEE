"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Explanation: Alice's offer is too high. We can definitely negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I believe this product has great potential, but the price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Strategy:**  We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still comfortably above her perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling that we're serious buyers. 
* **Tone:**  The message maintains a polite and respectful tone to encourage a positive negotiation atmosphere."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but it's still too high. We're aiming to stay well below $800,000 if possible.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice. Let's find a middle ground. How about $750,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the product's value."",
 ""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strategy:**  We're inching closer to a compromise. This counteroffer splits the difference between our previous offer and Alice's latest offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Tone:**  We continue to use a friendly and understanding tone to keep the negotiation on a positive track."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $825,000 for the product. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice is now claiming this is her lowest price, it's still above our target. There's a chance we can push her a little further down, even if it's just a small concession.  We'll take the risk of one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825,000 is close, but to be honest, I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $780,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of the product."",
 ""product_price"": 780000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strategy:** We're getting very close to Alice's likely bottom line. This offer makes a smaller jump than previous rounds, suggesting we're reaching the limit of our flexibility.  Mentioning a budget adds a sense of pressure.
* **Tone:**  The message remains polite and respectful but introduces a touch of firmness by stating our position clearly. 

**It's now a judgment call:**  Alice may accept this offer, but there's also a chance she'll reject it, forcing us to decide between accepting her $825,000 price or going with John's $1,000,000 offer."
