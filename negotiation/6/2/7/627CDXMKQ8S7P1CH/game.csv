"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I believe this product has great potential, but the price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $825,000 for the product. That's the lowest I can go.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825,000 is close, but to be honest, I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $780,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of the product.",780000.0,Bob,6,
