"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Approach:** Using a friendly message sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** Mentioning the product's value to Bob helps him see the potential benefit of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer is too low for me to accept. 
* **I have room to counter.** I can still make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my minimum.
* **John is a safety net.** Knowing I have the option to sell to John for $150 gives me confidence to hold out for a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $125 is still a bit below my minimum. Would you be willing to go up to $130?  I think this is a fair price considering the value the product offers."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's still below my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but not give in entirely.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm again highlighting the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the benefits he'll gain.
* **Staying Flexible:** Using phrases like ""willing to go up to""  shows I'm still open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $127.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer, $127.50 is still below my minimum of $150.
* **Negotiation Room:**  I still have a few rounds left to try and get a higher price. 
* **Safety Net:** John's offer is still a guaranteed $150, giving me leverage to hold out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise.  How about $132.50? That's closer to my minimum, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 132.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm offering a slight increase from my previous counteroffer. This shows I'm still willing to negotiate but not giving in too much.
* **Focusing on Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing fairness by mentioning my minimum price and the product's value to Bob.
* **Open-ended Question:**  Ending with a question invites Bob to engage in further discussion and potentially reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $127.50. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We are already halfway through the rounds, and Bob is insistent on his $127.50 offer.
* **No Significant Progress:** Bob hasn't moved much from his initial counteroffer, and I'm unlikely to get much closer to my minimum.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

It's better to secure the $150 from John than to risk getting stuck with a lower price from Bob."
