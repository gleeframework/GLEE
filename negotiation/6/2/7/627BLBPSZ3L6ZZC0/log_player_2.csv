"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($100 < $120).** This means you're getting a good deal compared to buying from John.
* **You're saving $20 compared to buying from John.** This is a significant savings. 
* **Even though the product is worth less to Alice ($80), the offer is still profitable for her.** This means there's likely room for negotiation in the future if you're interested in further purchases."
