"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this incredible item. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $10000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $10,000 is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the initial price point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000 for this product.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $8000, but I have to make sure I get a fair price for the product. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $9500. This is a compromise that I believe is still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is attractive:** $9,500 is significantly lower than buying from John for $12,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** Bob has already pushed Alice down to a price closer to her valuation. Further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether. 
* **Prioritize securing the product:** Bob's goal is to acquire the product, and this offer provides a good deal compared to his alternative."
