"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $8000, but I have to make sure I get a fair price for the product. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $9500. This is a compromise that I believe is still a great deal for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
