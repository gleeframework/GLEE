"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,600,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its worth to me. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,600,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a fair price for me considering the value I place on the product. I'm confident this is a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
