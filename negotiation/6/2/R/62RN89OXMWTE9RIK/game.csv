"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential for you. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter offer.  I understand your perspective on the price, but  $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial proposal. Let's meet in the middle a bit - how about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $1,050,000. How about we try $980,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to stay within my budget.",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $980,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Would you be willing to consider $1,020,000?  I believe this is a fair compromise.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still trying to find a price that fits within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,020,000, but I'd like to propose a slight reduction to $995,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and my financial constraints.",995000.0,Bob,6,
