"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints but $12,000 is too low for me to consider. Could you do $17,000? That's a significant price reduction on my end.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer $14,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14000.0,Bob,4,
