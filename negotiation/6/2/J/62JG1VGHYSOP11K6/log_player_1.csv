Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'd like to offer $10,000.  It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go below $11,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows us both to get a fair deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
