"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to get a lower price.  You're willing to pay up to $120, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
