"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, as you've mentioned you value it at $800,000.  Let me know your decision, and I'll  respect your choice.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up at $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer might be tempting, you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $1,100,000.  Your goal is to save money, and buying from John achieves that."
