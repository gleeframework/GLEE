"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget and there's room for negotiation. It's best to try and get a better price before considering John's offer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target, I can still push for a better price. There's room for further negotiation, and I'm not ready to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,120,000. I believe this is a reasonable price that meets your needs and still reflects the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,120,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $1,150,000.  This is a good deal for me considering my budget and the fact that I can still save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John.  I'm confident that further negotiation is unlikely to get a significantly better price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn."
