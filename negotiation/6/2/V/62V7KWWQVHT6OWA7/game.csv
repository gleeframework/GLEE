"Hello Bob, I'm Alice. I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, I'm not comfortable starting at $1,400,000. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,325,000.  I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000? This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while still offering you a good deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
