"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value for someone with your expertise.  I'm confident you'll recognize its potential. While I can't disclose specifics about its nature, I can assure you it's worth at least $800000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its value, but also allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  I'm proposing a price of $1000000.  This is a fair price given its true potential.  Please let me know if you're interested in exploring this further.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
