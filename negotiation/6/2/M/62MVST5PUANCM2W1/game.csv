"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  Would that work for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",9500.0,Alice,3,
