"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $1300000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1300000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1400000. I believe this is a fair compromise and will allow us to reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1400000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit over budget. Would you be willing to consider $1350000? This would be a fair price that allows us to both walk away happy.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $1380000. I think this is a good balance between what I'm looking for and what you're willing to pay. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1380000.0,Alice,5,
