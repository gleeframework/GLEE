"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a unique item that's truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I believe it's a steal considering its rarity and potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Given my research and the value I see, I'm willing to offer $750,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $850000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this unique item. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $750,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $750000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'll counteroffer at $825000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.
