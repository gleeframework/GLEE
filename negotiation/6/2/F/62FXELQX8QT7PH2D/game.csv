"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can come to an arrangement that benefits both of us. My starting price is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $850,000 is a good starting point, we're still a bit apart.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the significant value this product brings to your business, and it's also a fair compromise from my initial offer. I'm confident we can close this deal if we work together.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the product's value while allowing us both to benefit from a successful deal. Let's close this deal at this price and move forward.",900000.0,Bob,4,
