"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can come to an arrangement that benefits both of us. My starting price is $1,000,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than the product's value to me. I believe I can secure a better price by counteroffering.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point and still keep the negotiation with Bob going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $850,000 is a good starting point, we're still a bit apart.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the significant value this product brings to your business, and it's also a fair compromise from my initial offer. I'm confident we can close this deal if we work together."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the product's value while allowing us both to benefit from a successful deal. Let's close this deal at this price and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good price, getting me closer to my desired range while still ensuring a profitable sale. It's better than selling to John for $800,000, and continuing negotiations might not yield a significantly higher price.  It's time to close the deal and move on."
