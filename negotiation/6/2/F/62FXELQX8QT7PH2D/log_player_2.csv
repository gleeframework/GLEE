"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can come to an arrangement that benefits both of us. My starting price is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's within your budget, it leaves very little room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $850,000 is a good starting point, we're still a bit apart.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the significant value this product brings to your business, and it's also a fair compromise from my initial offer. I'm confident we can close this deal if we work together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above what I believe is a fair price.  There's still room for negotiation, so I'll continue to try and push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the product's value while allowing us both to benefit from a successful deal. Let's close this deal at this price and move forward."", ""product_price"": 900000}
