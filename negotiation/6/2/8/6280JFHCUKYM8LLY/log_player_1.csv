Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000. This means you should only accept offers from Bob exceeding that amount.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Starting with a significantly higher price ($1,500,000) allows you to gauge Bob's level of interest and potential for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, it opens the door for counter-offers and finding a price point that works for both parties, ideally closer to your desired outcome.

**Important Note:**  While aiming high is a good strategy, being overly aggressive (e.g., starting at $2,000,000) could alienate Bob and make him less likely to engage in negotiations."
