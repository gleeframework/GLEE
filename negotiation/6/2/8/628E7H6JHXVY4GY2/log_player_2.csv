"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let you have it for $125. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You value the product at $150, and Alice is offering it for $125. While that's a good deal, you can get it for $150 from John, which is your maximum value. Since you want to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the better option."
