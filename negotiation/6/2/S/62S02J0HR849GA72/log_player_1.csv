Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Initial Price:** Since we know Bob values the product at $10,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, starting high allows room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** Offering the product at $19,000 aims to maximize profit if Bob accepts.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high initial price doesn't mean it's final. If Bob negotiates, there's flexibility to lower the price while still staying above the $15,000 backup offer from John.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable with a potential rejection from Bob. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can always sell to John at the guaranteed price."
