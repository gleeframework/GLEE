Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly remind Bob of its worth without being too pushy. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message implies there's room for discussion, which can be more inviting than a firm, take-it-or-leave-it offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know Bob values the product at $12,000, he doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at that price. This gives you some leverage.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** A higher offer carries the risk of Bob rejecting it outright. However, it also presents the opportunity for a higher profit. You need to decide how much risk you're comfortable with."
