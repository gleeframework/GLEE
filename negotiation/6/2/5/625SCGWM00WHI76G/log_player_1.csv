{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price as close to my minimum of $150 as possible, but I'm also leaving room to negotiate.  I'm hoping to strike a deal with Bob, but I'm always ready to sell to John for $150 if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $150 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to sell for higher, accepting his offer guarantees me a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
