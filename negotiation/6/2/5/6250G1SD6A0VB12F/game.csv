"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount of time and resources into this product, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to set a minimum price that I'm comfortable with. I can offer it to you for $11,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair price that works for me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've done some further research and I believe the market value of this product is higher than what we've discussed so far. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $12,250. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle from here.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but that price jump is a bit much for me. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250. This keeps us moving closer to a fair deal for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can offer it to you for $12,000, which is the same price I initially offered. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the deal.",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but we're still not quite there. I'm willing to make my final offer of $11,100.  This is a fair price and gives us both a reason to be happy with the deal.  What do you say?",11100.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping you can see the value in the product.",12500.0,Alice,9,
