Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Given your product's value to you is lower, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This reflects a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
