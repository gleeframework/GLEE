"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product to you, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $110 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to pay $105. This is a fair price that's a good compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $107. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",107.0,Alice,5,
