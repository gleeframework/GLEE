I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will reject. This will allow me to gauge his willingness to negotiate and set the stage for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $120 is better than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'll reject the offer and try to get closer to my target in the next round."
