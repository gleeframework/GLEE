"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I have to make a living too! I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer at $11,000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a good price. I'll counteroffer at $11,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. My best and final offer is $10,500. If we can't agree on that, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",10500.0,Bob,6,
