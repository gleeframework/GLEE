Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I am looking to keep my spending within a $12,000 limit. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $12,000.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $12,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise between our respective positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,500 is closer to my ideal price, I still believe I can get a slightly higher amount with continued negotiation. I have 6 more rounds left to reach a better deal, and I'm not willing to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're committed to getting the best price. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my position. I've reviewed my budget again, and I believe we can reach an agreement at $13,000 for the product. This price aligns closely with your last offer while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, accepting Bob's offer for $13,000 is the best option.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial target of $15,000, we've reached a point where continuing negotiation might lead to a lower price or even a failed deal.  It's important to recognize that there's always a risk in pushing too hard, and $13,000 is a reasonable outcome.  Besides, selling to John for $15,000 still remains an option if this deal falls through."
