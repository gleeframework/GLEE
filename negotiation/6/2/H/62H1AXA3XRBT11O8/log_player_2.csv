Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $800000 is simply too low.  This product is truly special, and I'm confident it's worth a lot more than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1400000?  I'm willing to compromise to make this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $1000000 is definitely a step in the right direction, but it's still below what I need to make this deal work for me. How about we split the difference at $1200000? It's a fair price considering the value of this product.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
