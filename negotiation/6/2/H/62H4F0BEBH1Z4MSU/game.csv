"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, given its value to you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's meet in the middle.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,500 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $11,000? I'm willing to make a compromise to get this deal done.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $11,250? This would give us both a fair deal, and we can close this out.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down further, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $10,750? I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit to get this deal done, but I need to make sure it's still within my means.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm only willing to go down to $11,000. This is a fair price for the value you place on the product, and it's the final offer I can make.  If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go down to $11,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and my original offer of $10,000. How about we settle at $10,500? This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,8,
