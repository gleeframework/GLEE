"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is lower than the price you'd pay John ($15,000).  While you'd prefer a lower price, accepting Alice's offer still saves you $2,500."
