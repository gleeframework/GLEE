"Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $650,000 is a good price, it's still a significant amount of money.  Bob's goal is to save as much as possible. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice. It's possible Alice is willing to go lower, and Bob could save a substantial amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so he makes a bold counteroffer of $500,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it might be enough to spark further negotiation. If Alice is truly motivated to sell, she might be willing to accept a price closer to Bob's offer. If she rejects, Bob can adjust his counteroffer based on Alice's reactions and continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $600,000 is still cheaper than buying from John, it's not a huge improvement from Alice's previous offer. Bob is still trying to get the best possible price, and there's no reason to settle yet. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially get a price closer to his desired $500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some flexibility by lowering her price from $650,000 to $600,000. This suggests she might be willing to compromise further. Bob's counteroffer of $550,000 is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest price. It's a reasonable offer that signals Bob's seriousness without being overly aggressive. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can consider increasing his offer slightly or opting for John's deal if the negotiations become too tedious."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $625,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $625,000 is a good compromise, considering the previous offers. It's lower than her original price of $650,000 and closer to Bob's desired price of $550,000.  While further negotiation could potentially yield a slightly lower price, there's no guarantee, and the process could be time-consuming.  The risk of Alice rejecting Bob's next counteroffer and ultimately leading him to buy from John at a much higher price is too high. Accepting this offer allows Bob to get the product at a decent price without further risk."
