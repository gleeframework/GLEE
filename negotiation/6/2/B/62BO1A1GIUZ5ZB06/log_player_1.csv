Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn closer to Bob's perceived value of $15,000.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the potential benefit for both of us, making it more likely for Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not making a hardline offer. The message implies a willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to counteroffer if he's not satisfied. 

**Important Note:** This is just the initial offer. I'll need to adjust my strategy depending on Bob's response and the potential for negotiation. If Bob is unwilling to pay anything close to my desired price, I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While $9,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly below my desired price. I'm confident I can do better.
* **Potential for Counteroffer:** I believe I have leverage in this negotiation. Bob's message shows his genuine interest in the product. I can likely push for a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a $6,000 gap between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This indicates room for compromise and a potential price that benefits both of us.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob.  I will aim for a price closer to my desired price point, but still leave room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for something closer to my original offer of $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. 
* **Appeal to Fairness:** The message emphasizes that this price gives ""both of us a good deal,"" framing it as a fair and mutually beneficial outcome. 
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I avoid making a hardline statement, leaving the door open for further negotiation if needed.  

**Important Note:** 

This is still a negotiation.  I'm willing to consider adjusting my counteroffer further based on Bob's response, but I'm confident that $10,500 is a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from $10,500. How about we try $9,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is only $500 away from my previous offer of $10,000. This means we are getting closer to a mutually acceptable price.
* **Limited Upside:** While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away completely, leaving me with John's offer of $8,000.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale with a significant profit margin compared to selling to John. 

**Important Note:**

It's a strategic decision to accept Bob's offer. While I might be able to negotiate a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal entirely is too high at this point. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a price that is both profitable and reasonable."
