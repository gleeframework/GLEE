"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for something closer to my original offer of $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from $10,500. How about we try $9,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
