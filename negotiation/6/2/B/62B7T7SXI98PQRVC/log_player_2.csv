"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $650,000 for the product. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we start at $500,000?"", ""product_price"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $575,000 for the product. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $575,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $570,000. This is already a compromise for me, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $570,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $570,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could try to negotiate further, $570,000 is a significant savings from both the initial offer and John's price. It's unlikely I'll get Alice much lower, and risking a worse deal isn't worth the potential savings."
