Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000) but still higher than Bob's estimated value ($12,000). This should encourage Bob to consider the offer, while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that's too low. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $14,000 to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  This gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $13,250 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $12,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's too low. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $12,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at least $13,000 to make this work. Let's split the difference between our last offers and go with $13,000. It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,750. How about we meet at $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I am willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not going to go below $13,000. That's a fair price considering the value of this product.  I'm confident you'll be happy with it at that price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're confident in the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last offer, so how about $12,625? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached the 8th round of negotiations, and Bob's offer of $12,625 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to settle for a price that's too low. It's better to sell the product to John for $15,000, which will guarantee me my minimum acceptable profit."
