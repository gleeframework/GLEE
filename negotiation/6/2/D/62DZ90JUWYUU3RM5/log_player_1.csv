"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,200,000. This is a strong opening offer that leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob will likely counteroffer, giving us the chance to find a price that works for both of us. However, I am also prepared to walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't produce a satisfactory outcome."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to settle for significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,050,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my initial offer, but still ensuring I make a profit and don't undervalue my product. I'm confident that Bob will see this as a fair offer and agree to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable. I'm not willing to sell for $800,000. I'll counteroffer again in the next round. I'm still confident we can reach a fair deal, but if Bob continues to be inflexible, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $950,000. This is a significant concession, but I believe it's still a fair price that reflects the product's value. I'm hopeful Bob will accept this offer, but if he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John. I'm running out of rounds and need to find a solution quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting ridiculous. I'm not going to continue this negotiation any longer. I'm running out of rounds and I'm not willing to sell for anything less than $1,000,000.  I'm going to sell to John."
