"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a significant reduction from the initial offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be at $1,350,000 to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can meet at this price.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
