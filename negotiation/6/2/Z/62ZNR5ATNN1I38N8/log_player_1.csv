Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $80 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving space for counter-offers:** Bob knows the product is worth $120 to him, so he's likely to counter.
* **Staying flexible:** I'm open to negotiation, but I won't accept anything below my minimum price. If Bob rejects my offer, I can still make a counter-offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good price:** $90 is a good price for me, as it's above my minimum of $80. 
* **Risk of counteroffers:** If I reject, Bob may counter again, and we could get stuck in a long negotiation.  There's also the risk of him getting frustrated and walking away, forcing me to sell to John for $80.
* **Time is money:** Accepting Bob's offer now ensures a quick sale and a profit."
