"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still a bit high, considering the product is worth $10,000 to Alice. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth exploring those options before resorting to John's $15,000 price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Bob is trying to get the best deal possible, so he's starting with a lower price than Alice's initial offer. 
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $10,500 is still slightly above Alice's value for the product, making it a potentially acceptable offer for her. 
* **Leaving Room:** Bob has some room to negotiate upwards if Alice rejects this offer, but he wants to see if he can secure a good price early on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still High:** $13,500 is still significantly higher than Bob's maximum value for the product. He wants to get a price closer to $10,500. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** There's still room to negotiate with Alice, and Bob is confident he can get a better deal. 
* **Avoiding John:** Buying from John is still the last resort, and Bob wants to avoid paying that much if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is offering a price that's halfway between his previous offer and Alice's last offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and hopefully encourages Alice to meet him halfway.
* **Staying Below Max Value:** $11,500 is still below Bob's maximum value of $15,000, giving him some wiggle room if needed.
* **Negotiation Momentum:** This counteroffer helps keep the negotiation moving forward, showing Alice that Bob is serious about getting a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired price range. He's not desperate enough to buy at this point.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting the offer, Bob keeps the negotiation open and shows Alice that he is not willing to settle for a price that is not favorable to him. 
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:** There's a possibility that Alice will lower her price further in the next round, and Bob wants to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  Bob is increasing his offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise. This is crucial for keeping negotiations going.
* **Meeting Halfway (Almost):**  This offer is almost halfway between his previous offer and Alice's last one. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Bob wants to see if this offer is enticing enough to convince Alice to accept. 
* **Leaving Room:**  While Bob is getting closer to his maximum value, he's still leaving some room for a potential counteroffer from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $12,750 is very close to Bob's target price of $12,000. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only three rounds remaining, Bob doesn't want to risk Alice becoming more stubborn or the negotiation breaking down. 
* **Avoiding John:**  While buying from John is always an option, Bob wants to avoid paying the full $15,000 if possible. 

This offer is a good compromise, and Bob is willing to accept it to secure the product and avoid further negotiations."
