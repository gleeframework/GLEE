# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than my maximum of $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $9,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $11,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my budget, but it's still higher than my maximum of $8,000.  I'm not willing to pay that much. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get her to come down a bit more.  If not, I can always go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $11,000 is still above my budget.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me in the middle, and I'll sell the product to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $11,500 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's likely that we won't reach an agreement. I've reached my limit, and it's better to buy the product from John at a price that fits my budget."
