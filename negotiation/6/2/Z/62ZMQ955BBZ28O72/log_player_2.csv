Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is worth more than $7,000.

Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're getting close to your limit, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer it to you for $8,100. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice has shown she's firm on not going below $8,000.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better price. Accepting the $8,100 offer secures a decent saving compared to John's $10,000 price."
