"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is worth more than $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value you'll get from it.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still finding it a bit steep.  How about $7,500?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still hesitant about the price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $8,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. This is a great product, but $8,200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. My final offer is $7,800. If you can't do that, I understand, but I may have to explore other options.",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your limit, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer it to you for $8,100. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",8100.0,Alice,7,
