"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $100 is a good price, it's a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. How about we meet in the middle at $105? That way, I can get a good deal, and you can still make a reasonable profit.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $105 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still not quite there. Let's compromise at $112.50.  That's a good deal for both of us, and I can make this work.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $112.50, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $112.50. How about $108.75? That's the best I can do.",108.75,Bob,6,
