"Alice, your initial offer is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'd like to offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a significant gap from where I see the value. This product is truly unique and offers immense potential beyond the price you've proposed.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This recognizes the value while still acknowledging your interest.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand your perspective on the value, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's try $950,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part and shows my genuine interest in acquiring this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
