"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's something I value at least $80, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than your maximum budget of $120, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of her coming back with a lower price, getting you a better deal."
