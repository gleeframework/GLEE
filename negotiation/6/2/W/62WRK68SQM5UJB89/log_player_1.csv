"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering Bob a price that's a bit higher than the product's value to him. This will give me some room to negotiate if he counters.  I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a bit closer to my desired price, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,700,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than what Bob is currently offering. I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now very close to what I'm hoping to get for the product. It's better than my minimum price, and it's getting late in the negotiation. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to Bob for $1,650,000."
