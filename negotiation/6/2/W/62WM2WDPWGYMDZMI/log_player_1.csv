{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a bit above Bob's value of $100, but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $120. It gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me a good profit margin. It also opens the conversation by highlighting the potential value of the product for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $105.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value of $120.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $105 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $110. This still leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still aiming to spend a little less. Would you be willing to do $108? That's a fair price for us both, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $108 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below it.  I'm confident I can get a better price from John, so I'll sell the product to him for $120."
