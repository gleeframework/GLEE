"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a little high for me, I'd be willing to pay $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me Alice.  While I agree it has value, $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  the value of this product is substantial, and $750,000 doesn't reflect that. I could consider $825,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value here and I'm ready to make a serious offer. How about $780,000?",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer is very close to what I had in mind.  To be honest, I have another buyer interested at a very similar price point. To avoid losing out to the other buyer,  would you consider $810,000?",810000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the position you're in. I'm willing to move a bit to $790,000.  Let me know if that works.",790000.0,Bob,8,
