"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer that I think is fair and reasonable. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:

Alice is clearly signaling that she won't go much lower than this.  While I could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are unlikely to outweigh the risk of losing the deal entirely. Accepting at $825,000 is a good compromise."
