Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.  Any price above this gives him a ""surplus.""
* **Your Goal:**  Maximize your profit by getting as close to Bob's maximum of $800,000 as possible, without going below your $1,000,000 minimum.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Anchor:** Starting at your ""$1,000,000 minimum"" sets a strong anchor. While Bob might counter, it immediately positions the negotiation in your favor. 
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" enhance the perceived value of the product.
* **Open for Negotiation:** ""Let me know your thoughts"" signals you're willing to discuss, but it doesn't obligate you to lower the price.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower, but never below your $1,000,000 guarantee.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, a more moderate opening price might be strategic.

**Remember:**  You have a strong position with John as a backup. Don't be afraid to walk away from the negotiation with Bob if he's unwilling to meet a price that works for you."
