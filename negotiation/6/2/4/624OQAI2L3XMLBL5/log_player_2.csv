"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $12,000. You are willing to pay up to $15,000, so there is room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $10,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You're aiming for a price closer to $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - how about $11,000? I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and you're still not budging. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer it to you for $11,750. That's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go lower than $11,750.  You're willing to pay up to $15,000.  While $11,750 isn't your ideal price, it's still a good deal compared to buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you $3,250."
