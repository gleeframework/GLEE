"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $10,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - how about $11,000? I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and you're still not budging. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer it to you for $11,750. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",11750.0,Alice,5,
