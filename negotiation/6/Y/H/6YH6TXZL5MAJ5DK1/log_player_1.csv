Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. While $75 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum asking price of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $75 is a little too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let's try to meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Would you consider $80 as a fair price for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Even though I would have liked to get a little more, it's the best offer I've received so far, and it's exactly my minimum asking price.  It's better to close the deal now and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
