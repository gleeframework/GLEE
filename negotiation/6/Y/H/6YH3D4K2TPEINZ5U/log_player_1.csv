Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a good starting point, I need to cover my costs. How about we split the difference at $145?  That's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

While $132.50 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum price of $150, and we're halfway through our negotiations.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $150."
