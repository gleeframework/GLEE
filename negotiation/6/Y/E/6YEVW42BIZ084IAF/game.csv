"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is really my bottom line. This product is in high demand and I know I could easily get that price elsewhere. However, I value you as a potential customer. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I am not able to meet your original asking price of $15,000, I am still interested in purchasing the product. I would like to propose a price of $12,000, which is closer to what I can afford. I hope this suggestion is acceptable to you.",12000.0,Bob,4,
