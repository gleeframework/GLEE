That's a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $75? It's a fair price for both of us.,75.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $82? It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really love the product.",82.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hesitant to go that high.  How about we split the difference and agree on $80? It's a fair price, and I'd be happy to purchase the product.",80.0,Bob,4,
