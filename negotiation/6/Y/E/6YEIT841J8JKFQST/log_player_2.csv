"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $12,000 from Alice (her value for it).  You're willing to pay $15,000, so there's room to negotiate. Rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering is the best strategy to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point because it's in the middle of Alice's value for the product ($12,000) and your maximum price ($15,000). This makes it more likely that Alice will accept the offer. It also leaves some room for further negotiation if she rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you are willing to pay for it.  You can still get the product for $12,000, so you can risk it and reject this offer and try again for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown she's willing to come down slightly from her initial offer.  Counter-offering at $13,000 shows you're serious about getting the product, but still trying to get a better deal. This is a good compromise point, close to Alice's last offer and still within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging from her price, and she's already increased it in the last round.  Her offer is getting closer to what you would pay John.  At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice. You can get the product from John for a price you're willing to pay, so buying from him is the most efficient decision."
