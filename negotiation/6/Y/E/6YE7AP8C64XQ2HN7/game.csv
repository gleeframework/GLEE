"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which is the maximum I can pay at this time. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1200000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and potential returns. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1200000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to go that high. I'm prepared to offer $900000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product and its potential returns. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and potential returns. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
