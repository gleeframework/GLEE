Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's more than my minimum acceptable price:**  I'm guaranteed $800,000 from John, so I'm willing to settle for anything above that.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's a $200,000 gap between my offer and Bob's perceived value, giving him incentive to negotiate and potentially reach a deal that benefits both of us. 

By offering a price that's fair but still leaves room for negotiation, I maximize my chances of getting a higher price while also keeping the deal alive."
