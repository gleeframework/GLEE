Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. While I appreciate your interest, $500,000 is far below its actual value. I could consider a price of $1,200,000 for you. This is a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my willingness to find a fair deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to the product's value.  To be fair to us both, I can't go below $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers.
