"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be a great fit for your needs and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? It's a fair price that fits my budget and allows you to get closer to your desired price.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly interested in the product and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While $9,250 is closer, I can't accept anything below $10,000.  This is my final offer, so let me know if it works for you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
