"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Would you consider $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and meeting me halfway. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
