Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price to John ($1,500,000) sets a high anchor. This makes Bob perceive the final offer as a better deal.
* **Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, prompting Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Highlighting the product's value to Bob's business reinforces the idea that the price is justified.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while leaving you secure in knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John if Bob declines."
