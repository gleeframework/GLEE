,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $12,500? That's a good compromise, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $12,500. How about $11,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $11,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet in the middle. How about $12,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit above $12,000. How about $11,800? I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible.",11800.0,Bob,6,
