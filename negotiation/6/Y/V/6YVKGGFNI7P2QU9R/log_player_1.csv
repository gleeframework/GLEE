"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, even more so than my initial asking price. To kick things off, I propose a starting price of $2,300,000. This factors in the potential benefits and returns you'll gain from its unique features."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:**  Starting with a high but not outrageous price anchors the negotiation in our favor. While $2,300,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it gives us room to negotiate down. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  By focusing on the product's potential benefits for Bob, we aim to shift his perception of its value and justify the high price.
* **Leaving Room:**  This initial offer allows for multiple rounds of negotiation where we can gradually concede while still aiming for a final price significantly above our minimum ($1,500,000). 

This strategy is about maximizing our potential gain while staying aware that we have the John backup offer if negotiations don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. Considering the current market conditions and potential return on investment, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We have room to negotiate and gauge his willingness to move closer to our range. Selling to John at this point would be leaving potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you presenting your perspective and counteroffer. I understand your assessment, but the value of this product, especially tailored for businesses like yours, sits considerably higher. To move towards a mutually agreeable deal, I propose a price of $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:**  We want to maintain a positive and collaborative tone by recognizing his counteroffer, even though it was significantly lower than our target.
* **Reiterating Value:**  We're gently pushing back on his valuation by restating the product's unique value proposition, particularly for his specific needs. 
* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:**  Dropping to $1,900,000 shows flexibility on our end while still staying significantly above both our minimum and his offer. This large concession signals a willingness to negotiate but also sets a firm boundary.

We aim to see how Bob responds to this counteroffer. It will provide valuable insight into his potential for reaching a price closer to our desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I've carefully considered your proposal and am willing to meet somewhere in between our previous offers. My counteroffer is $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the difference is no longer substantial enough to risk losing the deal. 

Here's why accepting is the best move:

* **Profitable Outcome:** $1,600,000 represents a $100,000 gain over selling to John.
* **Strong Negotiation:** We've successfully guided Bob up from his initial offer of $1,200,000.
* **Time Value:** Prolonging the negotiation carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or us reaching an impasse.

Accepting Bob's offer now secures a favorable deal and avoids potential complications."
