"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This represents a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,400,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my absolute lowest price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you've come down to $1,500,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,300,000. This is my last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm selling the product to John. Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John rather than risk getting a lower offer from Bob."
