Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully incentivizes Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price. I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm offering the product at my minimum price. This is a fair compromise that demonstrates I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I'm also not willing to go any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is below my minimum price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell at a loss.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so I'll accept his offer."
