"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still within a range that might be attractive to him if he believes in the value.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario for both of us.
* **Building a relationship:**  A friendly opening message sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Understanding the risk:**  I'm aware that this might be too high for Bob and he might reject it, which is why I have the option to go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum:** While it's a significant drop from my initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price. I'm confident that Bob is genuinely interested, so there's room for further discussion.
* **Testing Bob's interest:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to gauge his commitment and see if he's willing to come closer to my desired price. 
* **Avoiding a quick sale:** Selling to John right now would be a safe move, but I'd be leaving $100,000 on the table. I want to explore all my options before making that decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This would give you a good deal while still allowing me to reach my desired price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob:** My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial price, showing my willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle ground approach:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer, creating a sense of fairness.
* **Highlighting benefits for both:** I'm emphasizing that this price offers a good deal for both of us.
* **Staying above the minimum:** While I'm willing to compromise, I'm still ensuring that I'm above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Keeping the door open:**  This approach leaves room for further negotiation in case Bob rejects my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, his offer of $950,000 is still below my target of $1,000,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John is a safe option, I'm still hopeful that I can get a better price from Bob. 
* **Negotiation is a game of patience:** I'm willing to play it out a few more rounds to see if I can convince Bob to come up slightly higher.
* **Building a relationship:** I'm trying to build a rapport with Bob to potentially encourage him to be more flexible. 
* **Staying open to options:** I'm not closing the door on selling to John yet, but I'm also not ready to accept Bob's offer at this stage."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm always open to negotiation,  $950,000  still falls a bit short of my target price. How about we compromise at $1,000,000? It's my minimum, and it would allow us both to walk away with a good deal. I'm confident this product will be very valuable to you in the long run."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer approach:** This counteroffer is essentially my final offer. I'm firm on the price, but also trying to appeal to Bob's long-term interests in the product.
* **Highlighting my minimum:** I'm explicitly stating that this is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Building trust and credibility:**  Emphasizing the long-term value of the product and how this deal would benefit both of us.
* **Setting a deadline:**  This round is a crucial decision point for Bob. If he rejects this offer, I'm likely to sell to John in the next round.
* **Leaving room for a last-minute agreement:** While I'm setting a firm price, I'm also leaving the door open for Bob to accept it and conclude the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $975000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the tipping point:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough.
* **Risk of losing more:**  There's a chance that if I reject this offer, Bob might walk away entirely. 
* **Time is running out:** We're halfway through the negotiation rounds. It's becoming more likely that I won't be able to get my desired price.
* **Safeguarding profits:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $1,000,000.
* **Moving on:** I've explored all options with Bob, and I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer who will close the deal."
