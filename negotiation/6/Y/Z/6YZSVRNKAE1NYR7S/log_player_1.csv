Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, his final offer of $1,185,000 is still less than John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000.  At this point, continuing the negotiation with Bob poses a risk of him walking away, leaving you with a less favorable outcome."
