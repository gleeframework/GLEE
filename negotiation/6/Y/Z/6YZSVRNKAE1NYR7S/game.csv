"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective, the $1,100,000 price doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm confident it can significantly benefit your business. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the response. I appreciate you working with me, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to come up slightly to $1,150,000. Let's make this deal happen!",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. I'm willing to be flexible, but the product's value remains high. Let's settle this at $1,220,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1220000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I understand this is a valuable product. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,185,000?  This is my final offer.",1185000.0,Bob,6,
