"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique opportunity, $20000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to offer $13000 for the product, considering its value and my budget.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering its value and the initial offer I made, I'm not comfortable going as low as $13000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $18000. This is a fair price that takes into account your budget while still reflecting the product's worth.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $18000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14500, as I genuinely believe this product would be a good fit for me.  This price reflects a reasonable compromise, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I'm glad to hear that you believe the product would be a good fit for you. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $14500. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $17000. This is a fair price that takes into account your willingness to compromise, while also ensuring I get a good deal for the product.",17000.0,Alice,5,
