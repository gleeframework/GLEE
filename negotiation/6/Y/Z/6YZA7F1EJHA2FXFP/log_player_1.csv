Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its worth and the benefit it will bring to you. "", ""product_price"": 1500000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  While the price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" and emphasizing the ""immense value"" might sway him. 
* **Alternative:** You have a safety net with John, so there's less pressure to settle for a lower price immediately.

**Important Note:**  This is a risky strategy. Bob might be completely turned off by the high price and refuse to negotiate. However, it maximizes your potential profit if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
