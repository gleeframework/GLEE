"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe could be incredibly valuable for you.  While I can't disclose specifics yet, I can assure you it's worth no less than $1000000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a significant opportunity, but ultimately the decision is yours. If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1000000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
