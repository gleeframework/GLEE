"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly below the maximum I know Bob is willing to pay. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A $10 buffer gives us room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and inviting tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:** The product is worth $120 to me, and Bob's offer is only $10 above that. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I still believe I can get closer to my desired price of $140.  
* **Staying in the Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to consider $135? That's a good middle ground and a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer but not entirely meeting it. 
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing the price as a ""good middle ground"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. How about $132? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Risk:**  Bob's offer of $132 is significantly closer to my desired price and a good amount above my minimum threshold of $120. 
* **Risk of Loss:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob altogether, and I'm unsure if I can get a better offer from him.
* **Time Constraint:** We are already in round 4, and I don't want to risk running out of time. 

Accepting the offer allows me to secure a good price for the product while minimizing the risk of getting a lower offer or not reaching an agreement at all."
