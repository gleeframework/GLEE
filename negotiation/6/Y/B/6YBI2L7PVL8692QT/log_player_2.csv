{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $175. This is way too high. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

You are willing to pay the maximum of $100 for the product. This is your best counteroffer to Alice."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum value for the product.  You should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

You are willing to pay a little more than your initial offer, but still want to keep the price as low as possible. This counteroffer is a compromise that could potentially lead to an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high, and you've already made multiple counteroffers. It's clear that negotiating with Alice is unlikely to get you the price you want.  It's better to just buy the product from John for $100, which is your maximum value for the product."
