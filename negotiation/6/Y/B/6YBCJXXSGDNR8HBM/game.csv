"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is way out of my budget. This product would be valuable to me, but I'm only willing to spend up to $6,000. Would you consider that?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand it's a valuable product, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I could potentially stretch my budget to $7,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
