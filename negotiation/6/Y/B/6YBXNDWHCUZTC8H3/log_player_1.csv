Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:** This price allows for potential counteroffers without me needing to drop below my minimum price immediately.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing the offer as a good deal to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Flexibility:**  By leaving room for negotiation, I can potentially get a better price or, if necessary, move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. 
* **Opportunity to Counter:** I have the opportunity to counter and potentially secure a better price. 
* **John's Offer:** While John is offering my minimum acceptable price, I still want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is higher than his offer but still lower than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $13,250? It's a good compromise that still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** This offer keeps me above my minimum acceptable price while still being attractive to Bob.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the compromise and framing it as a ""good deal"" for both of us.
* **Building Momentum:** By demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, I hope to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $13,000? I really think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:** Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, and I'm willing to accept it.
* **Potential for Counteroffers:** While I could counteroffer again, there is a risk that Bob would reject it. This could lead to a longer negotiation or even a rejection, forcing me to sell to John.
* **Time Value:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the potential time and effort involved in further negotiations. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at a price that is very close to my goal and avoids any potential risks associated with further negotiations."
