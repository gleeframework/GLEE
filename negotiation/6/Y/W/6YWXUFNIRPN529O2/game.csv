I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $180?,180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $135? ",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $135 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Would you be willing to consider $165?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $165 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $145.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! I can do $155, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be interested in?",155.0,Alice,5,
