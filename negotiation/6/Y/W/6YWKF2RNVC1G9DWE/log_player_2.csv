"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and would greatly benefit your business. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $600,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to be more realistic about its value. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

How about we try $700,000? I think that's a fair offer considering its value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to offer a price of $900,000. This is as low as I can go without sacrificing my profit margins. I hope this is something we can work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $900,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at $800,000 and avoid further back and forth."
