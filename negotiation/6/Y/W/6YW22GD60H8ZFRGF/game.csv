"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, that price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  How about we meet halfway between our two offers at $1,850,000?",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,850,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,700,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'd like to see some more flexibility from you.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and am willing to be flexible.  However, the value of this product is significant. Let's settle at $1,775,000 and close this deal.",1775000.0,Alice,5,
