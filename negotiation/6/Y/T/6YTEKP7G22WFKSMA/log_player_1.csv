{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has signaled this is his final offer, and at $1,050,000, it's still significantly below John's standing offer of $1,200,000.  There's little point in continuing the negotiation with Bob if he's unwilling to budge further.  Accepting John's offer ensures the best possible outcome for Alice."
