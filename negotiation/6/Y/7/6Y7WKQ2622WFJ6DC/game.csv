"Hi Alice, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $9,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $12,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really get a lot of value out of it. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $10,500.  This is my final offer, let me know if it works for you.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I can meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price for a unique product like this, and I think you'll be happy with it. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
