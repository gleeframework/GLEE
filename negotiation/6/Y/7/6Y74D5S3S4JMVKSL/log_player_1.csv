"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $175 is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me, leaving space for Bob to counter without feeling pressured.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and open to discussion, inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $120 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest and I believe there's room for further negotiation.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I know I can sell to John for $150, so I'm not under extreme pressure to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $155? That's still a good price for you and leaves room for both of us to be happy."", ""product_price"": 155}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering $155, which is halfway between my last offer ($175) and Bob's offer ($120). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and makes the negotiation feel more balanced.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes that the price is still fair considering the product's value. It's important to remind Bob that he's getting a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $140 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $140 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation continues:** Although Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell and believe I can push for a slightly higher price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I know I can sell to John for $150, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $140 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit below where I need to be. How about $145? This would allow us to both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** I'm increasing the price by a small amount ($5) to show that I'm still negotiating but also not giving away too much.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:**  The message emphasizes that a deal at $145 would be beneficial for both of us. This helps Bob see that agreeing is in his own best interest.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiation comfortable and open to reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering your costs and the value of the product, I would like to propose a final offer of $142 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $142 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited negotiation room:**  There is very little room left for further negotiation, and it's unlikely Bob will increase his offer much more.
* **John's offer is a better deal:** John is offering $150, which is a guaranteed deal that is higher than what Bob is willing to pay. 

I'm choosing to sell to John because he is offering a price that is above my minimum and is a sure thing. While I could continue to negotiate with Bob, the risk of him rejecting my next counteroffer and losing more time is not worth the potential gain of a few extra dollars."
