"I understand you're looking to spend $1,000,000, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $1,300,000 for the product. Can we discuss this further?",1300000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I understand you need to make a profit,  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay. Would you be willing to come down to $1,150,000? This would be a good deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,300,000. I can offer the product to you for $1,250,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1250000.0,Alice,5,,
