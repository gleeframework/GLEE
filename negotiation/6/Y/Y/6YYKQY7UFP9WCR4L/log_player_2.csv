Bob should reject the offer. While it's a good price, it's still within the range where Bob can potentially negotiate a better deal. He can use his counteroffer to try and lower the price even further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend $1,000,000, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $1,300,000 for the product. Can we discuss this further?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target, it's still a bit high. Bob can continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price, as he still has room to bargain before needing to buy from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I understand you need to make a profit,  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay. Would you be willing to come down to $1,150,000? This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,300,000. I can offer the product to you for $1,250,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He has successfully negotiated the price down from $1,300,000 to $1,250,000. While he could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk of Alice getting frustrated and refusing to lower the price further. It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that is a good value."
