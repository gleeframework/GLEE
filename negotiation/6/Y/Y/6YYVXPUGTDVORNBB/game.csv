"Hey Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, I really appreciate your offer, but $200 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $130 right now. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $130 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $160? That's a fair compromise.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $160 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $145? That's a fair middle ground, and we can finalize the deal.",145.0,Bob,4,
