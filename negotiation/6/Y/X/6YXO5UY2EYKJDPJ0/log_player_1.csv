Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm starting with my desired price of $12,000.  This is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product.  While I know Bob values it at $10,000, I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate and we can find a mutually agreeable price. If he rejects this offer, I'll consider his counteroffer, but I'm also prepared to sell to John at any time for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob's offer of $11,000 is still higher than his own valuation of $10,000, and it's closer to my minimum price of $12,000. It's a good compromise and I'd rather secure the sale than risk a protracted negotiation or losing out on the potential profit."
