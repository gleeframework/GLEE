"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $14,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while working within my financial limits.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a balance between the product's value and your budget. However, $12,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of $16,000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and your needs.",16000.0,Alice,5,
