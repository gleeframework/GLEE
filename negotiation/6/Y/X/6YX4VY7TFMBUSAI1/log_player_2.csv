You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's close to your limit, you can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $780,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and gives us room for negotiation.  It's important to remember that Alice's ""bottom line"" is $800,000, so there is potential for a deal."

Alice is coming down in price, but I want to see if we can get closer to my target. I'll reject and try another counteroffer."

I'm going to counter with my maximum price of $800,000. This is Alice's bottom line, so if she accepts, it's a deal. If not, I'll go with John."
