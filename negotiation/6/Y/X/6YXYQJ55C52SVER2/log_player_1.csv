{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than your minimum acceptable price. It leaves room for negotiation while demonstrating that you are serious about selling to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I think we can work out a better deal. How about $950,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to accept and get a quick sale, I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'd like to propose $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise, I believe. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's a good compromise, and I'm willing to take it to avoid further negotiations and potential delays."
