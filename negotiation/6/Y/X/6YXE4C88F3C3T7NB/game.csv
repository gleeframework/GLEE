"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Would you be open to that?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  However, I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is the absolute top of my budget, and I truly believe this product is worth it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to give up on this deal just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
