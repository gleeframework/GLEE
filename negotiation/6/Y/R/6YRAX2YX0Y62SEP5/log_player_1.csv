Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, hoping to get a good deal.  If Bob rejects, I'll see what counteroffer he makes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $115. This is still above Bob's offer, but hopefully it's closer to a point where we can both agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $112 is still slightly below my minimum price, it's getting closer to what I want.  I'd rather not risk further negotiation and potentially losing a sale altogether.  It's also a bit riskier to keep negotiating since John is willing to buy the product from me for $120.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
