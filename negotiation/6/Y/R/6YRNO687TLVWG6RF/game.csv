"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is excellent, that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  However, $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. Could you do $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept that price. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, my final offer. This is a great price considering the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,5,
