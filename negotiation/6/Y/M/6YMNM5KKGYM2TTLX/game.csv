"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is important to both of us. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,500,000. Would you consider reducing the price to something closer to my maximum willingness to pay, which is $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your position. While that price point is a little lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
