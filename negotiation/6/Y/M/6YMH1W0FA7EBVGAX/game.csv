"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm excited about the prospect of acquiring this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
