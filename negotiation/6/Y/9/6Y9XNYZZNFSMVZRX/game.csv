"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,000 is too low for the value this product offers.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $8,000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to get a fair price for this product. It's clear we value it differently. Would you be willing to consider $15,000? This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
