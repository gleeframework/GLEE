"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go that low.  The product's value is significantly higher than $750,000, and I need to ensure I receive a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would be a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $800,000. How about we compromise at $820,000? This would be a good price for me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product.",820000.0,Bob,4,
