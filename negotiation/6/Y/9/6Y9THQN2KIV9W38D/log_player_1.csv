Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $150 (John), I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to that.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While I start high, the slightly lower price than my guaranteed sale might entice Bob.  There's a chance he might accept, or we could potentially negotiate a price that's still more beneficial than selling to John directly. 
* **Time Value:** Offering a high price initially might lead to a faster sale, even if it involves a small discount later. This is preferable to immediately selling to John if Bob is genuinely interested."
