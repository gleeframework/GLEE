Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit beyond my minimum of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $80 is my minimum, I'd prefer to make more. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. It's still a good deal for Bob, and it gets me closer to my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is only $5 less than my initial offer and is above my minimum. I'll accept it to avoid risking losing the sale completely."
