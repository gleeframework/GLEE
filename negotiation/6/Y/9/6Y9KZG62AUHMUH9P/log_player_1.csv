Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's in great condition and a real steal! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100.  It's above my minimum of $80, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is a good deal. It's above my minimum of $80 and close to my initial asking price. It's better to accept his offer than risk further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
