"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1150000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to go lower to secure a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1050000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This gives you a significant savings compared to your initial valuation, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
