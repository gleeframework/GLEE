Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer aims for a good middle ground:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), maximizing my profit.**
* **It's lower than Bob's maximum value ($1,200,000), giving him room to negotiate but still leaving a substantial benefit for him.**

This strategy sets the stage for potential counteroffers, allowing us to gauge Bob's willingness to pay and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1150000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1050000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is tempting, I'm aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Counteroffer:**  I can propose a price closer to my initial $1,150,000, potentially leading to a deal closer to my desired value.
* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting, I show Bob that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to walk away if necessary. 

This strategy keeps the negotiation active and gives me more control over the outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This gives you a significant savings compared to your initial valuation, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** By moving closer to Bob's price, I demonstrate a desire to reach a deal.
* **Maintains a significant profit:** $1,100,000 is still well above my minimum acceptable price and a good profit margin. 
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:** If Bob is still hesitant, there's potential for a small adjustment, but I'm not willing to go much lower.

This approach aims for a quick resolution while still securing a favorable price for me."
