Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to see if we can come to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $140. This is still above Bob's offer but shows a willingness to negotiate.  I believe this price is a fair compromise while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price, but it is closer to my desired price.  Given the possibility that he might reject further counteroffers, and John is willing to pay $150, I will accept Bob's offer to avoid further negotiations.  This will ensure I sell the product and receive a reasonable price."
