"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  It makes sense to negotiate and see if you can get a better price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  Unfortunately, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:** By starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000), we aim to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a much better deal than her initial asking price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $6,000 allows space for counteroffers and a potential compromise that still falls within your budget.
* **Polite and Direct:**  The message maintains a polite and professional tone while clearly stating your budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $9,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above what John is offering. There's room for further negotiation.  You'll likely counteroffer with a price closer to $8,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** Offering $7,000 shows Alice you're willing to move closer to her price but are still seeking a significant discount.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product,"" you subtly remind Alice that the product's value is subjective and open to negotiation. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By staying below $8,000, you keep the option of buying from John viable, which maintains pressure on Alice to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's final offer of $8,500 is still higher than John's standing offer of $8,000. At this point, further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield a better price.  It makes the most financial sense to buy from John and secure the product at the best possible price."
