"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your desire to get a good deal. However, $950,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000.  This is still a great price for a product you value at the same amount.  Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
