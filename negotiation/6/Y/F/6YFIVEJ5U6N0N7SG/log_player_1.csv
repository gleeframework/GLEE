Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product which I value highly. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have leverage. Starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's reaction to this initial high price will give you insight into how much he values the product and how willing he is to negotiate.  
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** There's a chance Bob might accept your initial offer, netting you a significant profit above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have the time and are comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting your initial offer."
