"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a bold move, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a good starting point for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a price that both of us can agree on."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm counteroffering with $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum price. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and we can come to an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough one, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  He's finally met my minimum price, and I'm running out of time.  There's always the risk he might reject a counteroffer, and then I'd be forced to sell to John for the same price.  It's time to take the sure thing."
