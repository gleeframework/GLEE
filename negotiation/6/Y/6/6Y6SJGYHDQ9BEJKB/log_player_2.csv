"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You want to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than the $12,000 you'd pay John, there's room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price closer to Alice's minimum value. This gives Alice room to negotiate while also demonstrating your commitment to purchasing the product at a reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still better than buying from John for $12,000. It's within your budget and a reasonable price for the product.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or the negotiations taking too long. Accepting this offer secures the purchase and saves you money compared to John's offer."
