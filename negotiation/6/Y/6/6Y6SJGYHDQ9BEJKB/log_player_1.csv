"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation with Bob. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as he values the product at $12,000. However, if he rejects it, I'm prepared to counter and potentially negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $11,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway from my previous offer.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price, given the value of the product to him."
