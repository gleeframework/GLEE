"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way over your budget. It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price. You can use the threat of buying from John to your advantage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, showing that you're serious about getting a good deal. It's also half of Alice's asking price, which is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. This counteroffer gives Alice some room to bargain but still keeps you well within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now come down to your maximum budget.  There's no need to risk further negotiation. Accepting her offer means you get the product for the same price as John, without the added risk of Alice potentially raising the price again in a counteroffer."
