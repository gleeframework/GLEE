"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to invest closer to the $800,000 mark. Would that price point be feasible for you?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your target price is $800,000, but I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
