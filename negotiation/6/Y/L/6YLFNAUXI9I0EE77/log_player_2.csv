"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe will be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $11,500.  This is a great deal considering the value it offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you offering this product to me. However, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $10,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. It's closer to what I had in mind, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would still be a great deal for you and allow us to reach an agreement. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $10,000, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
