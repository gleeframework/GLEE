Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe the product is worth more. I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1250000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer $1150000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of your product while staying within my budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm going to try and negotiate a slightly higher price in the next round.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $1,000,000 because I believe I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
