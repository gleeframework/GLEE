,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $115?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $115 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of this product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $120?  That's my absolute limit, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
