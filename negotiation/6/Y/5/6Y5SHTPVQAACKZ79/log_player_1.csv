Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd be very happy with it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $115?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $115 is better than nothing, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $115 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $120?  That's my absolute limit, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob is offering my minimum price, so it's a good deal for me. Accepting his offer means I get the $120 I need and close the deal."
