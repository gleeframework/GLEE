"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but that price is a little steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for it.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to what I can afford, Alice.  How about $10,000? That's a fair offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,000. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting pretty close. I'm willing to bump my offer to $10,250, but that's my limit.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $10,250. I'll sell it to you for $10,125. That's the best I can do, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",10125.0,Alice,7,
