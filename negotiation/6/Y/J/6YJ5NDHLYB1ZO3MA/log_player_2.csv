"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product for a competitive price. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It's better to try and negotiate with Alice or go to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can meet you in the middle at $15,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.

Bob should buy the product from John. While Alice has come down to $15,000, this is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  John is offering the product at Bob's price limit, so there's no need to continue negotiating with Alice."
