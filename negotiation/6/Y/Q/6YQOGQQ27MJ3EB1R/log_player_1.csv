""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I anticipate, I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, aiming higher initially could lead to a larger profit. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $12,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere above your minimum.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  Bob might be unwilling to pay significantly more than his perceived value of $8,000.
* **Risk Tolerance:**  There's a chance Bob will reject the offer, and you'll have to settle for the guaranteed $10,000. 

This initial offer balances the potential for higher profit with the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
