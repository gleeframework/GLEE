"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $9,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I could consider a price of $13,500. This offer represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 13500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product is worth more than $9,000, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,250. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly bargainning hard, but his offer of $11,250 is still a profit above your minimum selling price. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially lowering the final price or losing the sale to John."
