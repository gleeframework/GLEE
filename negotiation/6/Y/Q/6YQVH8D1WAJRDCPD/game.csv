,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $9,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I could consider a price of $13,500. This offer represents a fair compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you think the product is worth more than $9,000, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,250. Can we discuss further?",11250.0,Bob,4,
