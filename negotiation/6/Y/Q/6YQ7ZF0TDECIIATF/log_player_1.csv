{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **John as Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John if Bob declines.

By offering the product at $145, I'm aiming for the highest price Bob might reasonably accept while still leaving me with a profit margin."
