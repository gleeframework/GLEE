"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1300000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite there yet. How about we compromise at $1320000? It's a bit more than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",1320000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1290000, but I'd like to add a bit more value to the deal. How about we throw in some additional features and support, and I'll sell it to you for $1300000?",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate the additional features and support you're offering, but I'm afraid I'm still not willing to go above $1200000. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but no higher. Can you consider this?",1200000.0,Bob,8,
