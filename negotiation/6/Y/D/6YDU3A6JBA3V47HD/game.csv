"Hi Alice,  $16,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob.  However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer.  I could consider letting it go for $14,000. This is a very fair offer considering its true worth.",14000.0,Alice,3,
