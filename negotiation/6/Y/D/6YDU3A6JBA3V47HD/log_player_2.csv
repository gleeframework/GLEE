"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be a great fit for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $16,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way too high. It's above your maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob.  However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer.  I could consider letting it go for $14,000. This is a very fair offer considering its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial one, it's still above my maximum budget of $8,000. I'm going to reject this offer and continue to negotiate. There's still room for Alice to come down in price."
