Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, as that's the maximum I'm comfortable with. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my initial estimation of the product's value, I'm open to finding a compromise. Would you consider $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. If that's not acceptable, I'm going to have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob seems firm on his valuation and is unlikely to move significantly from $850,000. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
