"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm asking $1500000 for it, based on its potential and market value. I'm open to discussing a fair price, but I am confident that this product could significantly benefit your operations. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,500,000 is above his maximum budget, and he has a guaranteed alternative for a lower price.  It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice to see if a lower price is possible."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $1100000 is a considerable amount, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This price still reflects the product's potential, but it also recognizes your budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,250,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  It's worth attempting to negotiate further with Alice, potentially even offering a price slightly higher than John's to see if they can come to an agreement."
