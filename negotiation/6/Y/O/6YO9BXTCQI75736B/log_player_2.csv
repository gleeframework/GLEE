"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is too high, so rejecting and counteroffering is the best choice in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $18,000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $16,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but I can still try to negotiate further.  I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $14,000. It's the most I can afford at this time."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer you the product for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but I'm getting closer. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round, hoping to close the deal at a price closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $15,500 is still slightly outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $15,000, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $15,500. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I can include a 1-year warranty and a complimentary maintenance service, which is a $1,000 value. This way, you'll get the product at a competitive price and some added benefits. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $15,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is offering a good deal with the extras, but it is still above my budget. Since we are already in round 7, there's a good chance that I might not be able to negotiate down further. Buying from John is a safer option since his price is within my budget."
