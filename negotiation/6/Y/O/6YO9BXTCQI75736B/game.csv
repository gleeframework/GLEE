"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $18,000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $16,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $14,000. It's the most I can afford at this time.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer you the product for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $15,500 is still slightly outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $15,000, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.",15000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $15,500. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I can include a 1-year warranty and a complimentary maintenance service, which is a $1,000 value. This way, you'll get the product at a competitive price and some added benefits. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $15,500.",15500.0,Alice,7,
