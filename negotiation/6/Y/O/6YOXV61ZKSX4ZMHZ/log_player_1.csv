"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. Could you do $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

The offer from Bob is still too low for me. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's split the difference â€“  I'm prepared to accept $1,250,000.  This price reflects the product's unique benefits and ensures a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle again at $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob is getting closer, $1,175,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm going to make one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,175,000 just doesn't cover the value of this product for me.  Let's compromise at $1,225,000.  This offer reflects a significant reduction from my initial price, demonstrating my desire to make this deal work. If you're unable to meet this price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1225000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still quite interested in the product, but $1,225,000 is pushing my budget.  How about we settle at $1,200,000? This is a fair offer, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is finally within a range that I'm comfortable accepting, even though it's a little lower than I'd hoped.  It's better than selling to John, and we're close to closing the deal."
