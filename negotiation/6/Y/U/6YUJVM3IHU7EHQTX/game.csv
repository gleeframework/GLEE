,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $13,000? This gives you a great price while still allowing me to get a fair return on my investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to go a little lower, but $12,500 is still too low for me.  How about we settle on $13,500? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
