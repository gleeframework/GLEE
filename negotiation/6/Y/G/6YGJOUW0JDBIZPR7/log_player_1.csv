Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than what it's worth to me. This allows for room for negotiation while ensuring I start at a favorable point.  I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, giving me the opportunity to assess his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value through further negotiation.  Rejecting his offer keeps the potential for a better deal alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum. This shows willingness to compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come up with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, but we're getting closer.  I'm going to reject and counteroffer again, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired value.  There's still a chance to reach a mutually agreeable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still above Bob's last offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping this counteroffer will lead to a final agreement in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not at a point where I'm comfortable accepting.  It's becoming clear that we are unlikely to reach a mutually agreeable price.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I reach my minimum desired value and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
