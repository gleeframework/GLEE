Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a significant premium over what the product is worth to me, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to haggle. I'm also confident that I can get at least $800,000 from John if Bob rejects my offer, so I have some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is a decent price, it's still below my target. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm going to counter with $875,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but it still gets me closer to my desired price. It also leaves a bit of wiggle room for a potential final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a good deal for me. I'm confident that Bob will accept this offer, as it's just $25,000 less than my previous offer.  If he rejects, I'm ready to sell to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. While it's not my ideal price, I've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a better result. I'm confident that John will be a reliable buyer and I can avoid further rounds of potentially fruitless negotiations."
