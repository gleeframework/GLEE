Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,800,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this chance."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have significant leverage.  You can aim high with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:** You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, but he doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer.  This allows you to present the product as having even higher potential value.
* **Urgency:** The ""one-time offer"" and encouragement to ""seize this chance"" add a level of urgency that might push Bob to act quickly.

**Why this strategy:**

This approach aims to maximize your profit by:

1. **Exploiting Information Asymmetry:**  Bob doesn't know your bottom line, giving you an advantage.
2. **Anchoring:** Starting with a high price can influence Bob's perception of the product's value. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject this high offer. However, you have the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase at $1,000,000."
