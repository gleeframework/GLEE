Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Knowing its value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire it."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know John will pay $1,500,000, so that's our safety net. We want to get as close to that as possible from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $1,450,000 leaves a significant profit margin while still being a tempting offer for Bob, who values it at $1,000,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, it allows some wiggle room if Bob attempts to negotiate a slightly lower price."
