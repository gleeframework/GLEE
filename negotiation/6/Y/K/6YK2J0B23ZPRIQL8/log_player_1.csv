Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth $15,000 to me, and I think it's a fair price considering your value of $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. This shows I'm serious about selling to Bob, but also allows for potential compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm mentioning the product's value to me, subtly emphasizing the good deal Bob is getting. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  The price is not my absolute floor, so there's room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts:  Great! I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects:  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth accepting or if I should make a counteroffer myself. If things stall, I have the option to sell to John for my full value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am able to offer $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer is only $1,000 less than my minimum acceptable price of $14,000.  This is a very small difference.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a better price, but it could also drag things out.  There's a risk that Bob will get tired of negotiating or find another option.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Holding out for a higher price risks losing Bob as a buyer and having to sell to John for $15,000. This would mean losing a potential $2,000 profit.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that's close to my minimum and avoid the risk and uncertainty of further negotiations."
