"Alice, $120 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 right now. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $100? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  This is the absolute highest I can go.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $105? It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",105.0,Alice,5,
