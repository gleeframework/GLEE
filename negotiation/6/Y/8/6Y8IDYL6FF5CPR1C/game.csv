"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own a truly valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin discussions.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but your initial price is a bit high for me. How about we start at $900,000? It's a strong offer that reflects my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer reflects the value this product brings.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider $975,000?  That's a significant jump on my end, and I think it would make this a fair deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the product's value is undeniable, and $975,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal.  I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate the concessions you've made. To be completely transparent, I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for this product. It's a fair price that respects its value while working within my budget.  Let me know if we have a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
