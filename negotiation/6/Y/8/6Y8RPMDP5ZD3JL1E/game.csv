"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm more comfortable with a price around $10,000. Would that be something you'd consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is my best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's the highest I can go.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to meet me in the middle, and I appreciate that. However, I was thinking that since the product is worth $12,000 to you, it's worth a bit more than that to me. How about we try $16,000? I'm willing to give you a good deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for it.",16000.0,Alice,5,
