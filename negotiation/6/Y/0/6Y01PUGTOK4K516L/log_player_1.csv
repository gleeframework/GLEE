{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than the midpoint between our values ($12,500) to encourage Bob to accept the offer. However, I'm also leaving room for negotiation if he needs to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go below my minimum of $10,000 yet. I'll counteroffer him and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $11,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. Let's see if we can work something out!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,500? That's the best I can do for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is still below my ideal price, but it's above my minimum and closer to what I'm looking for. I'd rather not risk losing the deal with Bob and having to settle for John's lower offer.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
