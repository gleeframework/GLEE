"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is significantly below what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value and my need to make a profit.  What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting close to my limit. I can offer $9,875.  This is a very competitive offer considering I can buy it from someone else for $10,000.  Let me know if we have a deal.",9875.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  we're getting very close.  I'm willing to drop my price to $10,125.  This is my final offer, and if we don't reach an agreement, I'll need to move on.  Think carefully about this â€“ it's a good deal for both of us.",10125.0,Alice,7,
