"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. This price is still a good deal for you, as it's well above your valuation. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, considering your interest in the product.  This price is still fair and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,375,000.  This would allow us both to secure a fair deal. Let's finalize this transaction.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
