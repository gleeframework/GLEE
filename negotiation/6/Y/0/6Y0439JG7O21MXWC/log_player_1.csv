Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also reflects the fact that you have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $100, so you're not desperate to sell at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While you could sell to John for $100,  you'd prefer to get closer to the product's worth to Bob. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $110 is still a fair price, considering the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

Bob seems unwilling to budge.  While I'd like to earn more, selling to John guarantees a profit and avoids further negotiation."
