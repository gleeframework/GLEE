"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1050000 for the product. Can we discuss this further?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $950000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value",950000.0,Alice,5,

"I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $950000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package and a one-year warranty. I think that's a fair trade-off for the price. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $900000, and I'll take the premium support package and warranty. That's my final offer.",900000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go back to $900000, especially since I already offered you a premium support package and warranty. I'm willing to meet you at $930000, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the extras I'm including. What do you think?",930000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made a serious effort to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $920000, and I'll take the premium support package and warranty. This is my last offer, and I expect it to be accepted.",920000.0,Bob,10,
