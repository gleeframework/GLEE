"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, leaving some room for negotiation.  This offer is attractive to Bob, as he values the product at $120, but it also gives me a healthy profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 112}
```

I'm offering a slight compromise at $112. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring a decent profit.  It's a reasonable middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $108.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a slightly better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm sticking with $110. Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm not willing to go any lower than this. I'm hoping he'll recognize the value of the product and accept my offer. If he rejects, I'm ready to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for my liking.  While I would prefer to get a better price, I'm worried that we're going to keep going back and forth and I won't be able to close the deal.  Selling to John for $100 is a guaranteed profit, so that's what I'm going to do."
