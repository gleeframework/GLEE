"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1050000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1000000 is a fair price for this product. Considering its value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I'm not going any lower than that. I'm willing to make a slight concession, so I'm counteroffering $1150000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1100000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1200000. I'm counteroffering $1080000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",1080000.0,Alice,7,
