"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if I can get a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim Low:** Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer ($60) gives me room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below my $100 limit.
* **Appear Reasonable:**  The message suggests a willingness to compromise, which might encourage Alice to negotiate rather than immediately rejecting my offer.
* **Test the Waters:** This counter-offer helps gauge Alice's flexibility on price early in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to compromise. However, I was thinking of a price that's a bit higher than $60. How about we meet at $80? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved significantly from her initial offer, which is a good sign. However, $80 is still above my target price. I'll counter-offer to see if I can nudge her closer to $70."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're getting closer, Alice! I appreciate the compromise. Could you do $70? That would work well for me."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Steps:**  Moving in smaller increments ($10) now seems appropriate given Alice's counter-offer. 
* **Direct and Clear:**  I'm stating my desired price directly while remaining polite and appreciative of the negotiation process.
* **Time Consideration:** We're four rounds in. While I could aim lower, securing a price well below my limit with several rounds to spare is a good position to be in."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're getting closer, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and my original offer. How about we try $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to anchor the negotiation around her initial offer. While $85 is a decent price, I think I can get it lower.  I'm willing to push a little further, but I need to be mindful of the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand where you're coming from, Alice. Let's make this easy - how about $75 and we call it a deal?  I'm ready to buy if you're happy with that."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price directly between our last two offers, signaling a desire for compromise.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By suggesting a ""deal"" and showing a readiness to buy, I'm hoping to accelerate the negotiation and get a response to my preferred price point. 
* **Strategic Retreat:** If Alice rejects this offer, it might be a good time to consider John's offer, as further haggling might not yield significant savings."
