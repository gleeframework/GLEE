Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my company's needs. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. I propose a price of $820,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to the minimum I'm willing to accept ($800,000), I'm not desperate to sell. I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to $950,000 and potentially secure a better deal."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to $900,000 and keep the pressure on him to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
