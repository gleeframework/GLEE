"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This allows room for concessions and makes you appear less desperate to close the deal quickly.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,300,000, we establish a high anchor point in Bob's mind, potentially influencing his counteroffer to be higher than if we started lower.
* **Confident Language:** Using phrases like ""unique product,"" ""fair starting point,"" and ""believe this is a fair"" projects confidence in the product's value. 

**Important Note:**  While we have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, it's too early to settle. We have room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a much better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the uniqueness of the product you're offering. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than our desired outcome. We're willing to negotiate, but we need to guide Bob closer to our acceptable range.  We'll counter with a price that shows some flexibility but still maintains a strong position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,800,000 doesn't fully reflect that. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't go lower than $2,100,000. I believe this revised price represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Concede:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and show flexibility by coming down from our initial price.
* **Hold Firm (But Fair):** The reduction is substantial enough to encourage Bob but not so drastic that we undervalue the product. 
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the product's value reminds Bob why the price is justified.
* **Seeking Compromise:** Framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" encourages Bob to see it as a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $2,000,000. I hope this proposal will be acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $2,000,000 is now within a range we can accept. While we could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely we'll see a significant jump from here.  

* **Strong Profit:** $2,000,000 represents a $500,000 profit above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away or getting stuck at a lower price point. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now gives us access to the funds sooner.

Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of prolonged negotiation."
