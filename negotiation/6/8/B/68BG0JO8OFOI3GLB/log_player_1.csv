{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This is a starting offer that is slightly higher than Bob's valuation, but not so high that it's unreasonable. It leaves room for negotiation and shows that I'm serious about making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is below my minimum value for the product. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm confident I can get a better price than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping for something closer to my original price. Would you be willing to go up to $10,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $9,000 is a fair price. Can you meet me at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum value, and I'm not sure if we can reach a compromise.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John rather than risk further negotiation."
