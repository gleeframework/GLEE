"Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  While I think it's a great product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $15,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $12,500. That's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
