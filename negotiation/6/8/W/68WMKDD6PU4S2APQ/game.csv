"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. It's a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but I can't quite meet you at $850,000. Would you consider $725,000? I believe that's a fair compromise that reflects the value this product holds for me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's value. I'm thinking of $825,000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a good compromise between our positions.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  While $825,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $760,000.  Let's try to find an agreement on this.",760000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $760,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $825,000 is too high, but $800,000 is my minimum. Let's try $810,000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a good compromise between our positions.",810000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I can sense we're nearing a deal.  How about $785,000? That's a significant move on my part and shows I'm serious about buying.",785000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is my minimum, and I'm willing to accept it. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. Let's finalize the deal at $800,000.",800000.0,Alice,9,
