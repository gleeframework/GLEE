Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, but still ensures a significant profit above your $12,000 minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below that price. 

This strategy aims for a win-win situation where you secure a great price and Bob gets a product he values."
