"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value for you. This unique item is worth $1,200,000 to you, and I am offering it to you at a special price tailored to reflect its importance to you personally. My proposal is to sell it to you for $950,000. This offer allows you to secure this valuable asset at a significant discount while ensuring a fair return for my efforts and resources invested in acquiring it. Please let me know if you wish to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly inflating the value of the product to you. You know it's worth a maximum of $1,200,000 to you, and her offer is only slightly below that.
* You have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $1,200,000. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or simply go with John if she doesn't budge much. 

**Strategy:**

It's likely Alice will make another offer to avoid losing the sale. You can wait and see if her next offer is more reasonable."
