"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. This approach aims to maximize my potential profit while also showing a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering $105, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's only slightly lower than my counteroffer and significantly higher than selling to John. It's important to balance getting the best price with the risk of losing the deal entirely."
