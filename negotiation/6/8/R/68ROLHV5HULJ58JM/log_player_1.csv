Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is higher than what Bob values the product at, but still below what I need to get for it to be worthwhile. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I can get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try and get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $105 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to $110 for the product.  How about we split the difference at $107.50?"", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $105. Would you be willing to meet me at $106? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $106 is still a bit lower than I'd like, it's very close to my minimum price and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether. I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
