"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is higher than I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counter-offer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and propose something a bit lower in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my budget. How about we settle at $95? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

I'm nudging the price closer to my target while acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate. Let's see if she's willing to meet me at this price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $102? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly motivated to sell, and $102 is a reasonable compromise. It's close enough to my target price that it's not worth the risk of her walking away or the potential hassle of dealing with another seller."
