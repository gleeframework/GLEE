# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I see you're interested, and I appreciate that. While $110 is a bit too low for me, I could meet you halfway. How about $145? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $145 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget.  I'll try to negotiate further.  John is still an option if we can't agree."
