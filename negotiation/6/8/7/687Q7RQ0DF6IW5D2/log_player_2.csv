{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a better price.  There's a chance Alice will be willing to lower the price to secure a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above Bob's maximum budget. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to negotiate.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also keeping the price within Bob's comfort zone."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,375,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. While there's a chance of negotiating further, the risk of not reaching an agreement is high.  It's more prudent for Bob to take the sure thing and buy from John for $1,200,000, ensuring he gets the product within his budget."
