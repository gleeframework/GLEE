"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1,500,000 to you. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You'd save $150,000 by buying from Alice.
* **You're still getting a good deal.**  You're getting the product for less than what it's worth to you."
