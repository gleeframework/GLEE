"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,300,000. This reflects a compromise, but also ensures a fair return for the exceptional value this product offers. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
