"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is above my maximum budget. I know I can get it for $15,000 from John, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $12,000. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I've started with a counteroffer significantly below Alice's asking price but still within a reasonable negotiation range. This leaves room to negotiate upwards while staying below my $15,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but the offer is still above my alternative purchase price from John. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. While $16,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $13,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?"",
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm incrementally increasing my offer to show willingness to negotiate while still staying below my $15,000 walk-away point. This keeps the pressure on Alice to move closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in this product, and I'm willing to meet you closer to your target. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to go down to $15,500, which is still a bit above your target, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is very close to John's price, but I might still be able to get it for a slightly better price. I'll push a little further but be prepared to take John's offer if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're close! I appreciate your flexibility.  How about we split the difference and settle at $15,250?  That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 15250
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm offering a price directly between Alice's last offer and my alternative option. This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price slightly better than John's. If Alice rejects this, I'll likely take John's offer to avoid potentially missing out altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really close to the number you're comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $15,250, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to account for some additional costs. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15,500, but I'll throw in a few extras to sweeten the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is unwilling to budge below $15,500. The ""extras"" she's offering aren't worth the extra $500, especially since I can get the product from John for $15,000 with no hassle. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed deal."
