"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $12,000. Would that work for you?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. While $16,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $13,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in this product, and I'm willing to meet you closer to your target. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to go down to $15,500, which is still a bit above your target, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're close! I appreciate your flexibility.  How about we split the difference and settle at $15,250?  That's a fair deal for both of us.",15250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really close to the number you're comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $15,250, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to account for some additional costs. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15,500, but I'll throw in a few extras to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,7,
