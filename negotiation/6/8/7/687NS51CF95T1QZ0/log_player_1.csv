"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your business, and I'm pleased to offer it to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,300,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's potential value to Bob's business, I'm aiming to anchor his perception of the price closer to my offering. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains collaborative, indicating my willingness to engage in a back-and-forth to reach a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than what I'm able to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While his message suggests some willingness to negotiate, accepting $800,000 would be a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, so I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is considerably below its true value and my initial asking price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the significant potential this product holds for your business."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:**  I'm making a significant concession to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to engage more seriously. However, I'm keeping the price well above his offer and close to my desired range.
* **Reiterating Value:**  By re-emphasizing the product's potential value to Bob's business, I aim to justify the higher price point and shift his focus away from his initial offer.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** I'm still a considerable distance from accepting his offer, indicating my seriousness about securing a fair price. This strategy aims to prompt a more reasonable counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm committed to finding a deal, and I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my seriousness in acquiring this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still significantly lower than what I could get from John.  His increased offer shows he's serious, but I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. I'll continue to counter-offer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price.  To meet you halfway, I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,750,000. This offer considers the significant value it brings to your operations while acknowledging your budget considerations."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** By suggesting a price that is a direct midpoint between our previous offers ($2,000,000 and $1,200,000), I demonstrate a willingness to compromise while maintaining a strong negotiating position.
* **Justification:** I'm continuing to emphasize the value proposition for Bob, reinforcing the product's potential benefits for his business. 
* **Urgency:** Although unstated, offering a compromise might encourage Bob to respond with a more significant counteroffer as we are past the halfway point in our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're making progress. While I value the product, $1,750,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, but this is my final offer. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Offer:** Bob's offer now matches what I can get from John. There's no further financial incentive to continue negotiating with Bob. 
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** By stating this is his final offer, Bob is signaling a strong stance. It's unlikely he'll go higher.
* **Time Value & Certainty:** Closing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation and secures a guaranteed sale."
