"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $900,000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However,  $900,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000.  I believe this offer represents a fair deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $700,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $825,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while also being reasonable considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for me. How about we settle at $760,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,
