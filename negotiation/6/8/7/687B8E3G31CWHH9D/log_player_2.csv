"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. I believe it's a great value considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $14,000 is above his maximum budget, and he can get the product for $12,000 from John. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12500. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum desired price point. He can still get the product for $12,000 from John, making further negotiation with Alice the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $12,500 is a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $12,250. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and would save you the cost of selling to John.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12250}
