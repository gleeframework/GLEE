Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really like. I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a great deal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product to Bob for $130. This is higher than what it's worth to him ($120) but lower than what I can get from John ($150). 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while keeping the possibility of a deal with Bob open. By offering a price slightly below my fallback option, I'm increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting, while still earning more than I would if I sold to John."
