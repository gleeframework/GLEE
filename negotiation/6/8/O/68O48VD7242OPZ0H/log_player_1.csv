Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is key:**  We know Bob values the product at $15,000. 
* **Maximizing profit:** We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible without scaring Bob away.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping the price significantly above your minimum. 
* **Confident but not greedy:**  The message aims to be persuasive without being overly aggressive.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no way of knowing if Bob would be willing to pay his full valuation. If you had more information about Bob's negotiation style or risk tolerance, you could potentially aim even higher."
