"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $200. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is way too high.  Bob should reject the offer and counter with a price closer to his own limit."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $80 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $200 represents the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $170 for you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  He should reject the offer and counter again, aiming to get closer to his limit of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $170 is still a little out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints but $100 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $135? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer of $135 is still above Bob's limit of $80.  Since there's no guarantee that further negotiations will bring the price down to his desired level, Bob should buy the product from John for $80. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
