"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but only to $8,500. This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $8,200?  It's closer to my budget, and I think it's a fair compromise.",8200.0,Bob,4,
