"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product seems interesting, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price. I will try to negotiate a better price before selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but only to $8,500. This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $8,200?  It's closer to my budget, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price and I want to avoid the risk of losing the deal with him and having to settle with John for a lower price."
