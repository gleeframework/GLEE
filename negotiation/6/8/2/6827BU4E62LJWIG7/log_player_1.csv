Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down.  However, $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference from our last offers? I'd be willing to go to $1,250,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
