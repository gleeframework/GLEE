"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 undervalues the product's potential.  Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This price reflects the true value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down.  However, $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference from our last offers? I'd be willing to go to $1,250,000.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
