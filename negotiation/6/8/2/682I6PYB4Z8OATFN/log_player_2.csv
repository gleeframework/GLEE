"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:

It's clear Alice is not going to budge much from her initial offers. It's not worth the continued negotiation as her offers are exceeding our maximum budget.  Buying from John at $80 guarantees we get the product at the best possible price."
