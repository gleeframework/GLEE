Round 2

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm aiming for a higher profit.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, so I can afford to be a bit more aggressive."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, I'm not confident I can reach a better price with Bob. He's consistently offering lower prices than what I'm aiming for, and there's a risk that we won't be able to reach an agreement. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and it's a safer option at this point."
