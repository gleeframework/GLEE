This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the product's value, potentially influencing Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? It's still a great price for a product worth $10,000 to you, and it's a fair compromise for me.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's a significant saving for me and still a good deal for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Bob's offer of $9,000 is close enough to my minimum and represents a significant saving for him. Accepting his offer would be a good outcome considering my goal is to earn as much as possible."
