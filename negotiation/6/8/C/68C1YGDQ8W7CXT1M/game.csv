"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $90? I'm really interested in this product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $105. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. How about $100? This is my final offer, and it's the most I can afford to pay.  I'm really keen on this product, but I can't go any higher.",100.0,Bob,4,
