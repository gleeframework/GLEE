"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer! I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $95 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $100. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $98 for the product. That's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",98.0,Bob,6,
