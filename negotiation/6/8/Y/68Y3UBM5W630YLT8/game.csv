"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more offer: $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
