"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but $60 is quite low.  Could you meet me halfway at $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  How about $80? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While Bob is coming closer to his true valuation, further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price significantly higher than his $80 offer. Accepting $80 is a loss compared to John's offer.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
