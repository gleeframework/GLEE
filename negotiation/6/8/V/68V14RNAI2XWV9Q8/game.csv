"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, reflecting the inherent value of the product and my desire to make a deal.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, the product's potential warrants a price closer to my initial offer.

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $920,000 is still above my target.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering $880,000, a fair price that acknowledges both the product's potential and my need to stay within budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both show a willingness to compromise.",880000.0,Bob,4,
