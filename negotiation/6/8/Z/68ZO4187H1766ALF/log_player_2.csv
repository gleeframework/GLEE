"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I think you'll find it's a fair and competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $900,000 is still too high for him, and there's room to negotiate.  He can try to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I think we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While $850,000 is still higher than his ideal price, it's significantly lower than John's offer of $1,500,000. It's a good deal for Bob, considering the product's value to him."
