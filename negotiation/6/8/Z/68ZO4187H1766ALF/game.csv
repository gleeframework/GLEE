"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $700,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value to me and your own value for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I think we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
