``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.  I know my product is worth at least $800,000 to me, so I'm not willing to go below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this price will be acceptable to Bob, but I'm also keeping in mind my minimum selling price of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $920,000 is a good deal and  I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
