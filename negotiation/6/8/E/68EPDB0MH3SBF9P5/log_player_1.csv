# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,400,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think.
