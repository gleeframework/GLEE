"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,400,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a compromise, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $1,250,000. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,350,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. However, it's closer to his desired price.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get an even lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,350,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value to you and my budget. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not quite ready to go all the way down to $1,300,000. I'm thinking of a price of $1,320,000. It's a bit more than your offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it still exceeds his budget of $1,200,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for his maximum budget price, rather than continue negotiating with Alice."
