"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $1,800,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,800,000) as it gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the ""unique opportunity"" and ""valuable asset"" to pique Bob's interest and potentially increase his perceived value of the product. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end with ""Let me know your thoughts"" to signal that I am open to negotiation and avoid a hard ""take it or leave it"" stance. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John as a Safety Net:** I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not under immense pressure to close with Bob at any price.
* **Limited Rounds:** The 10 rounds give me a limited window, so I need to be assertive in my initial offer to get the ball rolling.
* **Unknown Bob's Value:** Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm taking a calculated risk with my initial offer. If he values the product much higher, I might be leaving money on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1800000 is above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1200000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,200,000 is my minimum threshold for selling the product.  Accepting this offer would be selling at a loss in my eyes. 
* **Negotiation is Key:**  I need to see if I can get a better deal from Bob.  Even though my initial offer was rejected, it's too early to walk away and settle for John's offer.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between my starting price and Bob's low offer.  This allows me to explore if there is common ground for a deal that's mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to compromise a bit. I'm proposing $1,500,000 as a counteroffer. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's work together to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and Mutual Benefit:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget concerns while still demonstrating the value of the product.  The counteroffer of $1,500,000 is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still represents a significant profit for me.  I emphasize ""mutually beneficial"" to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open Communication:**  The message reinforces my willingness to negotiate and find a deal that works for both parties. 
* **Strategic Reasoning:** 
    * It's unlikely Bob will accept this offer immediately, but it allows me to gauge his willingness to negotiate.
    * If Bob counters with a higher offer, I can lower my price further.
    * If Bob refuses, I'll have a better understanding of his true valuation, helping me decide whether to continue negotiating or walk away to John."
