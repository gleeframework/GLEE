Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This leaves room for negotiation, but also ensures I get a price closer to my minimum value.  I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than his $80 value to get the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is more than Bob's initial value, it's still below my minimum of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95. This is a compromise that's closer to my minimum value and hopefully still enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $90 is still below my preferred price, it's closer to my minimum value of $120.  I'm happy to accept Bob's offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation.  The potential for a longer negotiation could lead to a worse outcome, or even me having to sell to John at the lower price of $120."
