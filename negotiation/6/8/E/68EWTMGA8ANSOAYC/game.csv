"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000? This is my final offer before I consider other options.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,750. This is a fair price that's closer to both of our desired numbers. Let's make a deal!",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $10,900.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm not willing to go lower.",10900.0,Alice,5,
