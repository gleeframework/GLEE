"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is within your budget, it's still significantly more than the product is worth to Alice ($80). There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $100 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $120. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still remaining within my budget. It also leaves some room for Alice to counter if she's willing to make a further compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to my desired price, it's still higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Alice to see if I can secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price from $120 to $130, indicating a willingness to compromise.  I'm raising my offer slightly from $100 to $110, demonstrating my own willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my target.  This should hopefully encourage Alice to accept or make a further counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is still higher than I'd like to pay, but it is getting closer to my target.  I'm still within my budget and have time for more rounds of negotiation. I want to see if I can get a price closer to $110 or even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer to $120, which is a compromise between Alice's last offer of $135 and my previous offer of $110.  This shows Alice that I am serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not willing to pay her asking price.  It's a good middle ground that could lead to a deal being made."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is getting closer to John's price of $150. While it's within my budget, it's not a great deal.  I still have time and am confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is getting too close to John's price.  I'm offering $130, which is a compromise between her last offer and my previous offer.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but I'm not willing to pay her asking price. It's a fair offer that could lead to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $145 is getting too close to John's price of $150.  With only one round left, it's unlikely that Alice will significantly lower her price.  It's better to buy from John for $150 than risk getting stuck with a price I'm not happy with."
