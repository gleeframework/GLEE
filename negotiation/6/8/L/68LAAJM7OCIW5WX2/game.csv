"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree that the product is valuable, $1,500,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $600,000 is significantly below its market value.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its potential return on investment.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value this product represents, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I can offer $700,000; I believe this is a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I already have a standing offer at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your final offer is getting closer to what I can afford.  However, to make this deal happen, I need you to come down a bit more. I can do $750,000.",750000.0,Bob,6,
