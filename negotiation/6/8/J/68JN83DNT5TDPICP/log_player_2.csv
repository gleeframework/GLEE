Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1400000 is significantly lower than the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's meet in the middle.

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping to secure a price closer to my target. I still have 7 rounds left, so there's time to explore further concessions."
