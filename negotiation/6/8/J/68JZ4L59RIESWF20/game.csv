"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. It's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $14,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $16,500? That's a fair price considering the value to you. Let me know what you think.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $16,500 is still a bit steep for me. How about we try $14,500?",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $14,500.  Let's try $15,500.  It's a fair price for both of us.  I'm really hoping we can close this deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we try $14,250? That's a fair price for both of us.",14250.0,Bob,6,
