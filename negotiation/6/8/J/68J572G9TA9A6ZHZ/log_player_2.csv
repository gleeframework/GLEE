"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $120 by you. Considering its high quality and unique features, I would like to propose a price of $100 for it. This offer allows you to enjoy significant savings while still getting a great deal on an item you truly appreciate. I believe this price reflects the value you see in the product and provides you with an opportunity to make a smart purchase. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value by claiming you valued it at $120.  
* You know you can get the product for $120 from John. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of a counter-offer from her at a lower price, closer to her own valuation of $80. 
* Even if Alice doesn't budge, you haven't lost anything by rejecting and going with John."
