I will reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I'm hoping to get closer to my target price of $9,500. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept.  I want to see if I can get him to come up a bit more. I'll counter with a price closer to my last offer in the next round."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. 

While I would have preferred to get closer to my ideal price of $9,500, Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower, and I'm concerned he's not willing to budge much further.  I don't want to risk losing the deal completely and ending up with nothing.  Selling to John for $8,000 is a guaranteed sale and ensures I at least get my minimum desired profit."
