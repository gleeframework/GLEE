"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal and I think it's fair considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, it's still above Bob's target of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11250? That's a fair price considering the value of the product and my willingness to sell to someone else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,250 is closer to Bob's target than Alice's previous offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price of $10,000. Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price, as he's willing to buy from John for $10,000. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and potentially allows for a more favorable outcome for Bob."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,750 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to come down to $11000. That's a fair price considering the value of the product and our back-and-forth negotiation.  If you're still interested, let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's target of $10,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, Bob has already established a ""safety net"" by knowing he can buy the product from John for $10,000. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product at the guaranteed price from John rather than risk further negotiation with Alice that might not result in a lower price."
