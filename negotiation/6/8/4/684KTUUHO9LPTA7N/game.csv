"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable going below $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",9500.0,Alice,5,
