"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $15,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $12,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Could you do $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $9,500 makes the most sense at this point.  Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $9,500 is a substantial profit over my minimum price of $10,000. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations takes time and effort. Accepting now secures the sale.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly higher offer from Bob isn't worth the risk of him walking away entirely."
