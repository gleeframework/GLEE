"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great price considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

It's better to try and get a lower price from Alice.  You can counteroffer and see if she's willing to come down."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product for me. However, $9,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the product's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,250. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to me is $12,000. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,250 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high. You can try to negotiate further and see if she'll come down a bit more. Remember, you have a backup option in John, so you don't need to settle immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,875? This is still a good profit for you and a reasonable price for me.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8875}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's becoming more likely that Alice won't budge further.  You're already saving a significant amount compared to John's price.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price, and prevents the risk of Alice walking away or you needing to pay John's higher price."
