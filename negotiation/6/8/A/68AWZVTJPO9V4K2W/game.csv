"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great price considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product for me. However, $9,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the product's worth to you.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,250. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to me is $12,000. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a reasonable price.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,875? This is still a good profit for you and a reasonable price for me.  Let's finalize this deal.",8875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal.",9100.0,Alice,5,
