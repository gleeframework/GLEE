"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm confident it's worth at least $10000 to me, and I'm starting with a price of $15000.  What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in your product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand $12000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $13500? That's still a good deal for both of us, and hopefully we can find common ground there.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $13500. How about we split the difference and settle at $12750?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",12750.0,Bob,4,
