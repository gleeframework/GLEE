Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than your minimum:**  $12,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **Lower than Bob's perceived value:**  It's significantly less than the $15,000 Bob is willing to pay, making it attractive to him.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  There's space for both of you to compromise and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
