"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing what makes sense for you.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you be willing to come down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and acknowledging the value of this product.  $600,000 is quite a gap from my initial asking price, reflecting the significant value this brings. To move this forward, would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I can go as high as $700,000, but that's my absolute limit.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product is substantial.  I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,200,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth while hopefully still working within your parameters.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,200,000 is still beyond what I can justify.  My absolute maximum is $750,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
