"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? This recognizes the value you see while still being a fair deal for both of us.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget, I am unable to meet at $1,375,000. I would like to propose $1,360,000 as a compromise. I hope this suggestion is within your consideration.",1360000.0,Bob,4,
