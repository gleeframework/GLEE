Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($100) and higher than Bob's perceived value ($80). This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Positive message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While I'm aiming for a good profit, I'm not setting a price so high that it immediately shuts down any possibility of a deal. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and my desire to either maximize profit or secure a sale quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it to me for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is closer to my minimum desired price ($100), I'm still hoping to get a better deal. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $98. That's still a good price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 98}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by coming down from my initial offer.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging Bob to consider my offer.
* **Strategic price:** $98 is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum price, leaving room for potential further negotiation. 

**Strategy:** I'm aiming to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I really appreciate it. Considering my budget, would you be open to selling the product for $96? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Profit close to minimum:**  $96 is only $4 below my minimum desired price of $100.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price or a stalemate.
* **Time factor:** It's possible that John might be willing to buy the product but it's not guaranteed.  Selling to Bob for $96 secures a sale and guarantees a decent profit. 

**Overall:** Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical decision. It provides a reasonable profit without risking a lower price or losing the sale to John."
