"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize you see the value in this product, $900,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. Let's meet in the middle a bit - how about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're willing to meet in the middle, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.
