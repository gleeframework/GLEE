Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum threshold of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer meets my minimum requirement, I'm not willing to settle for the bare minimum. I'll try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counteroffering at $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it still leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $125 is a reasonable compromise and gives me a profit above my minimum requirement.  I'm accepting his offer."
