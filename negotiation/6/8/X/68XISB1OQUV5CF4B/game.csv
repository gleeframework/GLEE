"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $90 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $95. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a little high for me. How about $92? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $93, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",93.0,Alice,5,
