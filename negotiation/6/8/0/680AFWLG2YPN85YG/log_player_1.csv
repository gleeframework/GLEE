Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus you could negotiate for.
* **One Shot:** You only have one chance with Bob before you go to John.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your potential profit but not so high that Bob walks away. 

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain, which is a strong incentive for him to accept.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity,"" ""unique value,"" and ""significant benefits"" helps justify the high price.
* **Confident Tone:**  Using phrases like ""I'm pleased to offer"" and ""I believe this reflects a fair deal""  projects confidence in your offer.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. You could experiment with slightly higher prices, but going too close to $1,200,000 significantly increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
