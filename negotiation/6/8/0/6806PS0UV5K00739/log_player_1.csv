I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This price is significantly higher than my minimum threshold of $800,000 and leaves significant room for negotiation. I believe this is a strong starting point that maximizes my potential gains while still being attractive to Bob."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still not willing to settle for that price. I believe I can push for a higher price with another counteroffer. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further."

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,100,000.  This is a compromise between his last offer and my previous offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price. Since Bob rejected my previous offer at $1,150,000, I believe this counteroffer is more likely to be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum threshold of $800,000. Further negotiation may result in a lower price, so I'll accept his offer and secure a good deal."
