Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. To make this work, I'd be willing to offer $800000. This is the maximum I can pay, considering the value I place on this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
