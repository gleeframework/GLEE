"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm not sure I can afford $20000 for the product. I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Can you meet me at that price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $6000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $12000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of the product at this price. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $8000 for the product. Can you consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can sell the product to you for $10000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $10000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $8000. Can you consider selling the product to me for $9000?",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9000 is getting closer to my target price, but I'm still not ready to accept it. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $11000. This is a very good price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,7,
