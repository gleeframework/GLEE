# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! It's a one-time opportunity to get a fantastic item at a price that's lower than its true value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, but $150 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product and would be happy to pay $110 for it.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

Alice's offer is still a bit high.  While it's tempting, I'd rather try to get closer to my ideal price by making another counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $115? I'm really keen on getting this product, and I believe this price is fair considering its value."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've made a final concession, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. If you're interested, let's finalize the deal. If not, I'll consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is now at my maximum price, I've already wasted a few rounds trying to get a lower price.  John is offering the same price and there's no guarantee I can get a better deal with Alice.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
