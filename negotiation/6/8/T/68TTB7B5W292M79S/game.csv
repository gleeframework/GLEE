"Thank you for the offer, but $150 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product and would be happy to pay $110 for it.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating.",110.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I understand that $110 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $135, which is a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?"
