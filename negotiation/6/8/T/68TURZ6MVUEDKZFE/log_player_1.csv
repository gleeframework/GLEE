Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you're interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $175 is higher than your minimum of $150, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's not too aggressive:** It's a reasonable starting point that doesn't scare Bob off immediately.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** You can still adjust the price depending on Bob's response.

Remember, your goal is to get the highest price possible, but also to avoid a long, drawn-out negotiation that could lead to you selling to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Could you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below your minimum price of $150. While it's tempting to accept the offer since it's better than nothing, rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives you a chance to try and get a better price. You can counteroffer with a price closer to your minimum, potentially landing on a price closer to $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $160 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 160} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer within your range:** This counteroffer is still above your minimum of $150, but it's lower than your initial offer, showing you're willing to negotiate.
* **Reasoning provided:**  The message explains why you're rejecting Bob's offer and provides a reason for your counteroffer. 
* **Room for flexibility:** There's still some room to negotiate further depending on Bob's response.  

This approach aims to strike a balance between getting a better price than Bob's initial offer while also staying within a reasonable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $160. Could you consider $145? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is showing interest and is willing to negotiate, his offer of $145 is still below your minimum of $150.  You've already counteroffered and it seems unlikely that he'll budge much further.  

Selling to John at $150 guarantees you your minimum profit and avoids further negotiation. It's the safest option at this point."
