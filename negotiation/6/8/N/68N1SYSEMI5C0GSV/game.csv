"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $750,000 for your product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your need to sell.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's try to meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's settle this now.",800000.0,Bob,4,
