"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price.  $900,000 is too high, and you can always buy from John for $800,000 if you don't get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $750,000 for your product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your need to sell."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good move. However, you're still aiming for a price closer to your $750,000 counteroffer.  It's worth another round of negotiation to see if you can get closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's settle this now."", ""product_price"": 800000}
