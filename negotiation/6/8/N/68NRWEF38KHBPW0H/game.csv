"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $12,500.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price. I can see that you're willing to pay $12,500, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though, so I'll offer you a price of $13,750. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,750 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair to both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll offer you a price of $13,500. Let's meet in the middle again!",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make sure you're getting a good deal, and I'm trying to do the same.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go up to $13,250.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",13250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I can see we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'll meet you at $13,250, but I need to get at least $13,500. I'll make a slight concession and offer you a price of $13,375. Let's see if we can make this work!",13375.0,Alice,7,
