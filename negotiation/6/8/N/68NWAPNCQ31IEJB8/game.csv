"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,600,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $1,400,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  I hope this demonstrates my serious interest in reaching a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
