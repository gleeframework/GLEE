Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is quite high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to move from my initial price, but I need to see a more reasonable offer closer to my valuation. How about we consider $1,500,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position on the product's value.  To be fair, $800,000 was a low starting point.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000.  This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering John's offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the improved offer.  I appreciate you coming up to your perceived value. However, I have had significant interest in this product from other parties, with offers exceeding yours. I'm still willing to work with you, but I need to see a price that reflects the true market value.  Could you consider $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,350,000, and she may even try to push the price higher.  Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, which meets your maximum budget, there's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice.  You risk losing out on a good deal by trying to haggle further."
