"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that I'm sure you'll find highly beneficial. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1150000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1150000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1050000.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $1150000, which would be $1100000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can make a deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're making an effort to meet in the middle, and I appreciate that. However,  $1100000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to go up to $1075000. Let's see if we can finalize this deal with a slight adjustment.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1075000, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to ensure I'm not leaving any value on the table. I'm willing to go down to $1075000, but I'd like to throw in some additional services or support to sweeten the deal. If you're willing to meet me at $1075000, I'll include a comprehensive package of implementation and training to get the product up and running smoothly. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
