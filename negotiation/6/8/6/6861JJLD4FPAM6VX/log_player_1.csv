Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I am interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
