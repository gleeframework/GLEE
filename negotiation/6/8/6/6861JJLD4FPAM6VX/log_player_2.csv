"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a unique item that I'm sure you'll find very appealing. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,200,000, which is slightly above the minimum I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is at your maximum price point.  There's definitely room for negotiation, as her minimum is likely below $1,200,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I am interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below your minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you and reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price point.  While I can still try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting another counteroffer and me having to pay John's higher price is too high.  Accepting the $1,100,000 offer saves me $100,000 compared to buying from John."
