Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $130. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $120, and it leaves room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I would like to sell the product, $115 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a price below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $125. This is a compromise that's closer to his offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120. While Bob's offer of $118 is getting closer, I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. John is a reliable buyer who is willing to pay my minimum, so it's a safer and more profitable option than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
