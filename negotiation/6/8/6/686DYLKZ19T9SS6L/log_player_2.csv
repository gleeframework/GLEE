"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  Offering $800,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price. This is a reasonable starting point for the counter-offer, allowing for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price for Bob. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and then raising her price again is too high.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price, without risking a higher price or losing the product to John."
