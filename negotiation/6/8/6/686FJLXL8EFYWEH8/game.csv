"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm interested in making a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1300000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, which is my final offer. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1250000. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I'd like to add a condition: I'll throw in some additional services or support to sweeten the deal. This way, you'll get more value out of the product than just the price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1300000 with the added extras.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not convinced that the additional services are worth the extra $30000. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to sell it to me at that price, I'll have to explore other options.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
