"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save some money if possible.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to save money, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,175,000? This gives you a good price, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,120,000? I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to make sure I can make a profit on this deal.",1120000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,120,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal.  I can offer the product for $1,150,000.  This gives you a great price and allows me to meet my minimum requirements.  This is my final offer, let me know your decision.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a final concession, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,120,000 and $1,150,000. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $1,135,000?",1135000.0,Bob,6,
