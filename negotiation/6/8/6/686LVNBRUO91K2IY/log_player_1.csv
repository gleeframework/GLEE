Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I value at least $10,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my desired value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $9,500 allows for a few rounds of counteroffers before I have to consider selling to John. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message can help keep the negotiation flowing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, my budget is limited to $8,000 for this purchase. Would you consider accepting this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  It's significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $10,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I can likely get a better price by counter-offering and continuing the negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  If the negotiation fails, I can still sell to John for my minimum desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm coming down from my initial offer, showing flexibility. 
* **Still Profitable:**  $9,000 is still above my minimum desired value of $10,000.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that this is a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but unfortunately, I am unable to meet you halfway at $9,000. My maximum budget remains at $8,000. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is unwilling to budge further, and his offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired value.
* **Time is Valuable:** Continuing to negotiate could take time and effort without a guarantee of a better outcome.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation."
