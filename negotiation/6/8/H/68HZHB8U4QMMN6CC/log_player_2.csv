"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to sell you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within his budget, it's still above his ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $130?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $135. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget.** Bob is willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is offering it for $135.
* **Alice is likely to reject a lower counteroffer.** Bob already made a counteroffer of $130, which Alice rejected.  It's unlikely she'll go lower than $135.
* **Buying from John is more expensive.** John's price of $150 is higher than Alice's current offer.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer of $135 is the best choice for Bob to get the product within his budget while saving some money compared to buying from John."
