{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it incredibly valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer aims to achieve the following:

* **It's a strong starting point:**  $950,000 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is lower than what the product is worth to Bob, allowing for potential counteroffers.
* **It's a positive and encouraging message:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and invites Bob to consider the offer.

I'll be ready to respond to any counteroffers Bob might make and keep in mind the option to sell to John for $800,000 if the negotiation doesn't go in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $700,000 is far too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  

I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to send a counteroffer. I need to ensure I get a price closer to my target, and I still have the option of selling to John for $800,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $700,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $850,000? I believe this price is fair considering the value you'll receive. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain my negotiating position:**  $850,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Show flexibility:** I've come down from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Frame the offer positively:** The message focuses on the value Bob will get and positions the price as a compromise.

I'm still willing to sell to John if this counteroffer is rejected, but I'm confident this price is attractive enough for Bob to reconsider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to consider $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to compromise my bottom line.  

Therefore, I've decided to sell the product to John for $800,000. This ensures I achieve my minimum target and avoid further negotiations that might result in a lower price."
