"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $17,000. This gives me a good starting point and allows room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, it's a reasonable offer that he might be willing to consider.  I'm leaving some wiggle room in case Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit, which is a good outcome.  While I could potentially get a higher price with further negotiation, there's a risk of Bob walking away or the deal dragging on."
