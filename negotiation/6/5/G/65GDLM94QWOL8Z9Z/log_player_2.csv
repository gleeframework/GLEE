{""message"": ""Alice,  I see you're willing to meet me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too high. I'm going to stick with my last offer of $13,500. This is a good deal for both of us, and we're very close to an agreement. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,500. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $13,750. It's a small compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. He's only one round away from being able to buy from John for a guaranteed price of $12,000.  While Alice's offer is getting closer to his budget, it's still above his initial target and there's no guarantee that she'll accept his counteroffer. It's better to secure the product for a known price than to risk further negotiation."
