"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,500 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $16,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $12,500.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.  If not, I may have to go with another option.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to go up to $13,500, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $14,000.

"Alice,  I see you're willing to meet me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too high. I'm going to stick with my last offer of $13,500. This is a good deal for both of us, and we're very close to an agreement. Let's close this deal!",13500.0,Bob,8,
