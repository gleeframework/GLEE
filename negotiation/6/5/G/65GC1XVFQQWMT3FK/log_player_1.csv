"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $8,000, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I don't know Bob's value for the product, so it's best to start high and see where we land."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I believe I can get more. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500. It's still above my minimum, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. This is a good compromise that might be attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good deal. It's significantly above my minimum of $8,000 and only $500 less than my previous offer.  I'm confident I can get a better deal in future rounds, but given the limited number of rounds and the potential to sell to John for $8,000, accepting this offer seems like the best strategy."
