Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

I'm aiming for a higher price.  While $850,000 is better than John's offer, I want to see if I can push Bob a bit further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000.  This allows for both of us to get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

While $875,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to secure a better price.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can close the deal."
