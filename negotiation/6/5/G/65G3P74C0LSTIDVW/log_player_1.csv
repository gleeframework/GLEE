Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum price point.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000. I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,500?  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
