As we've discussed, the market value of this product is $1,200,000, and I'm willing to make a fair offer to you. I'm thinking of starting at $900,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
