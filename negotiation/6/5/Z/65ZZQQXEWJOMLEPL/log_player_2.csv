"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, the market value of this product is $1,200,000, and I'm willing to make a fair offer to you. I'm thinking of starting at $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the market value of the product. How about we try $850,000? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise. What do you think?

It's time to play hardball a bit. Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but we need to push for a better price."
