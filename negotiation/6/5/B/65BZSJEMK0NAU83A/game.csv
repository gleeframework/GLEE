"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is fair considering its value to me. Let's see if we can make this work.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to your desired price. Let's find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, but I think it's the lowest I can go. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to try to reach an agreement with you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $10,200, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",10200.0,Alice,7,
