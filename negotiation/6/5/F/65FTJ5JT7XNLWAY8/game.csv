"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This price reflects the value of the product and still gives you a fair deal. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my constraints. Can we try to find a middle ground? I'm willing to meet you at $8,750. This price should be more acceptable to both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $8,875. This price acknowledges your budget constraints while also reflecting the value of the product. It's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",8875.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, but $8,875 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my constraints. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750 again, and I'm willing to throw in a small concession to sweeten the deal. Can we revisit the price at $8,750 and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement?",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your offer.  However, I'm still unable to go lower than $9,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us.  With only a few rounds left, I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. What are your thoughts?",9000.0,Alice,7,
