"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it immediately shuts down negotiations.
* **Positive framing:** The message focuses on the value of the product and frames the offer as a good deal for Bob.
* **Room for negotiation:** This offer leaves space for counteroffers and negotiation without risking an immediate rejection.
* **Keeping John in mind:**  I'm willing to sell to John for $10,000, so I can afford to be flexible in the first few rounds with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob is willing to pay a premium, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** I still have 8 rounds left, and I can counter with a price closer to my minimum.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $10,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This price reflects the value of the product and still gives you a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Open to further negotiation:**  I'm asking for Bob's opinion, indicating I'm still open to further negotiation. 
* **Maintaining a reasonable margin:**  The price is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my constraints. Can we try to find a middle ground? I'm willing to meet you at $8,750. This price should be more acceptable to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Even though Bob's offer is a slight increase, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Time to be firm:**  We're halfway through the negotiations, and I need to start being more firm to push for a higher price.
* **John's offer remains a safety net:** I can still sell to John for $10,000 if I don't reach an agreement with Bob. 
* **Opportunity to counter:** I can use the next round to counter with a price closer to my desired range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $8,875. This price acknowledges your budget constraints while also reflecting the value of the product. It's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8875} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise again:** I'm showing a willingness to continue negotiating and meet Bob halfway, but I'm inching closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more than his offer, justifying the slight increase.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair deal"" for both of us, appealing to his sense of reason.
* **Staying above minimum:** The price is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's getting closer to Bob's offer.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With 5 rounds remaining, I need to start pushing for a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $8,875 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my constraints. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750 again, and I'm willing to throw in a small concession to sweeten the deal. Can we revisit the price at $8,750 and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Despite Bob offering a concession, the price is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to start being more assertive to push for a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John's offer is a strong safety net:**  I can still sell to John for $10,000, which gives me the flexibility to reject Bob's offer without losing out.
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I can use the next round to make a counteroffer that's closer to my target price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your offer.  However, I'm still unable to go lower than $9,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us.  With only a few rounds left, I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding firm:** I'm sticking to my previous counteroffer of $9,000, showing that I'm not willing to go lower.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Urgency:**  I'm highlighting the limited time remaining to put pressure on Bob to reach a deal.
* **Open to compromise:**  I'm still expressing a willingness to find a solution that works for both of us, but I'm making it clear that $9,000 is my bottom line. 

**This counteroffer is strategic:**

* **It's closer to my desired price:**  $9,000 is a significant improvement from Bob's latest offer, moving the negotiation closer to my goal.
* **It leaves room for a compromise:** If Bob counters with a slightly higher offer, I can accept and secure a deal.
* **It maintains my position of power:** My willingness to walk away and sell to John gives me leverage in the negotiation."
