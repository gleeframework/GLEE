Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, she's unlikely to reach a number that beats John's offer of $800,000.  It's time to cut off negotiations and go with the guaranteed lower price."
