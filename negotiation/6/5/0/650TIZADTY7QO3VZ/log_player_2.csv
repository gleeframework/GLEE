"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you could potentially get the product for a lower price by rejecting Alice's offer, there's no guarantee she'll come down enough. Accepting the $140 offer ensures you get the product at a price below your $150 maximum and saves you $10 compared to John's offer."
