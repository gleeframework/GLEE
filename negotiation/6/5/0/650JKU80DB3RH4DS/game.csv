"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still a bit above $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $1,150,000?  This offer represents a fair compromise for both of us, I believe.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above $1,200,000. How about we discuss a price of $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
