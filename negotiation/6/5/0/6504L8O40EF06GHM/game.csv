"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to both of us, and I believe we can find a fair price. My initial offer is $900,000.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to offer $750,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price.  How about $850,000? This still leaves some room for negotiation, and I believe it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original price, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $775,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer the product for $812,500. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us, and allows me to move closer to my desired price.",812500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $812,500 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to offer $805,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",805000.0,Bob,6,
