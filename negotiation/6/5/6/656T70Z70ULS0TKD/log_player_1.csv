Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think you'll find it to be a great value. Are you interested in purchasing it for $150?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering a price above Bob's perceived value, you can gauge his level of interest. If he accepts immediately, you've potentially left money on the table. If he negotiates, you know he's interested but wants a better deal.
* **Safety Net:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100. This gives you leverage in the negotiation. 

**Important:**  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if his offer is acceptable or if you're willing to walk away and sell to John."
