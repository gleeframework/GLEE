Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I know John is ready to buy at that price without further negotiation. It's in my best interest to sell to John and avoid the risk of Bob lowering his offer further."
