"Hi Alice, thanks for offering the product! I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly lower than I can accept.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $11,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. Could we settle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $9,500.  How about we make this the final offer: $10,500 and we have a deal?",10500.0,Alice,5,
