# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it will be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,000 to start the conversation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly lower than I can accept.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $9,500.  How about we make this the final offer: $10,500 and we have a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $10,500.  It's in your best interest to buy from John for $10,000 and save the extra money."
