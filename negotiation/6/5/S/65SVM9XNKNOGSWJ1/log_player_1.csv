"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher final price. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique value and potential,"" you provide a vague but positive reason for the high price, making it seem less arbitrary.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  Assuring Bob that you're open to discussion signals flexibility and encourages him to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,250,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly higher than his perceived value. This suggests there's room for him to go higher. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows you to counter with a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is firmly above that mark. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:**  You've significantly reduced your price from $2,250,000 to $2,000,000, demonstrating movement and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Firm but Fair:** You're holding firm above Bob's offer but using language like ""fair compromise"" to position the new price as reasonable.
* **No Justification:** You avoid re-justifying the product's value explicitly, as it might invite further pushback from Bob.  The focus now is on finding a mutually agreeable number."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,900,000. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to your target, but you're still significantly above your guaranteed sale price with John.  At $1,900,000, there's a good chance you can push Bob a bit further, especially with several rounds left in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a way to get this done.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,950,000?  This feels like a fair resolution to me."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency and Agreement:**  Phrases like ""Let's find a way to get this done"" introduce a subtle sense of urgency while reinforcing your desire to reach a deal.
* **Small Concession:** The smaller concession of $50,000 suggests you're getting closer to your desired price.
* **Framing:** Presenting the price as ""splitting the difference"" makes it seem like a more balanced and appealing option for Bob.
* **Time Consideration:** With five rounds remaining, you have some leverage to push a little further before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000, but no higher. I hope we can meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While you could likely push Bob a bit further, his increases are getting smaller, and he's signaling a firm budget limit. 
* **Strong Profit:** $1,850,000 is a substantial profit above your minimum ($1,500,000) and significantly more than Bob initially offered.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether. Accepting now secures a good outcome.
* **John's Offer:** While John offers your minimum, accepting Bob's offer now nets you an extra $350,000."
