"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I'm willing to pay that much, but I think it's a bit above my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $140. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $130 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference again and go with $135? This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'd like to offer $125. I think this is a fair price considering the original price was $150 and I've already come down from my initial offer of $120. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",125.0,Bob,6,
