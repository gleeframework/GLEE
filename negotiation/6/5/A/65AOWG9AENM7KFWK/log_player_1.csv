"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I'm aiming high initially to provide room for negotiation while staying well above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000).
* **Confident Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, potentially influencing Bob's perception. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The high price makes it clear I'm willing to negotiate, encouraging Bob to counter-offer.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize profit:** By starting high, I increase the chances of securing a deal closer to my desired outcome.
2. **Gauge Bob's seriousness:** His counter-offer will reveal how interested he is and how much he's willing to pay.
3. **Maintain the John option:** I retain the ability to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price if negotiations with Bob are unsuccessful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase from his perceived value, it's still considerably lower than my target price. I believe there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm aiming higher while keeping the door open for further discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counter-offer.  While your valuation is understandable, I'm still seeking something closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $2,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price by $200,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Holding Firm:**  The counter-offer remains significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum price, reinforcing the product's value in my eyes.
* **Justified Compromise:**  The message frames this price as a fair middle ground, encouraging Bob to move closer to my range.

I'm hoping this counter-offer will prompt Bob to either:

*  Accept the deal, yielding a good profit.
*  Counter with a significantly higher offer, showing his serious interest. 
 
I'm still conscious of the time limit and my alternative with John, but I believe there's more room for negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, which shows he's interested. However, $1,950,000 is still below my desired profit margin.  I'll reject this offer to signal that I'm aiming a bit higher, but the next round will be crucial in deciding whether to accept a compromise closer to his offer or move to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution we're both happy with. How about we settle at $2,050,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession, Firm Stance:** I'm reducing my price by another $50,000, demonstrating movement but remaining firm above the $2,000,000 mark.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By saying ""Let's find a solution we're both happy with,"" I subtly introduce a sense of urgency, indicating that we need to reach an agreement soon.
* **Final Offer (Implied):** While not explicitly my final offer, the wording and smaller concession signal that I'm getting closer to my bottom line.

This offer aims to:

1. **Encourage a Deal:**  It's a reasonable compromise that could entice Bob to accept.
2. **Push for a Strong Counter:** If he's truly interested, he might counter with an offer closer to $2,000,000.
3. **Prepare for John:**  We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. If Bob doesn't significantly increase his offer in the next round or two, I'll likely take John's offer to ensure a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $2,050,000 is the right price. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000, but no higher. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is a significant move from his last offer. However, it's a step back from his previous offer of $1,950,000. This indicates two possibilities:

1. **He's testing my resolve:** Bob might be trying to see if I'm desperate to close a deal and will accept a lower price.
2. **He's reaching his limit:**  $1,900,000 might be the absolute maximum Bob is willing to pay. 

In either case, I need to hold firm. Accepting now would likely mean losing out on potential profit. It's worth risking another round to see if I can nudge him higher or make a final decision about John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your current offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,975,000.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know your decision as I need to consider other options soon."",
""product_price"": 1975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** By stating this is my ""final offer"" and using a firm tone, I signal that I'm unwilling to go lower. However, the offer is still a compromise, meeting Bob more than halfway from his last offer.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other options"" introduces time pressure without explicitly threatening to walk away. This could incentivize Bob to make a decision quickly. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $1,975,000 keeps me above Bob's highest offer while still leaving room for a small profit if he accepts. If he rejects this, I'll likely move to John in the next round.

This offer aims to:

1.  **Secure a Final Deal:**  The combination of firmness and compromise might be enough to convince Bob to finalize the deal. 
2. **Prompt a Strong Response:** It might lead Bob to counter with a more serious offer close to $2,000,000.
3.  **Prepare for John:** If Bob rejects this offer, I've set the stage to move to John's guaranteed offer without appearing hasty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to make a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,925,000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're willing to accept, I'll make the deal. If not, I'll consider buying from John for $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob and sell to John. Here's why:

* **Bob's Bluff:** Bob's claim that he'll buy from John for $1,000,000 is a bluff. John has no incentive to sell below my agreed price of $1,500,000. 
* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob is consistently unwilling to meet my price point, even with compromises.  His final offer is significantly lower than my last offer and shows he's unlikely to budge.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer provides a guaranteed $1,500,000 profit with no further risk or negotiation.  

While I could counter-offer in a last attempt to get Bob closer to $2,000,000, the risk outweighs the potential reward at this point.  Accepting John's offer secures a substantial profit and avoids potentially wasting more time on a deal that's unlikely to meet my goals."
