"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I've got to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for the product. Can we discuss the possibility of a compromise at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's the best I can do.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
