"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's important to establish a high baseline. I have a backup option with John, so there's no need to settle for less right away. I'll see how Bob reacts."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is still a significant amount of money, but I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm getting nervous as we're getting close to the end of the negotiations.  Hopefully, Bob will see that this is my final concession and accept the offer."

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below my minimum, and we're running out of time.  John's offer of $1,000,000 is much closer to what I want and it's time to secure the deal."
