"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's valued at $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $10,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This feels like a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $11,000 is still a bit high for me though. I'm willing to offer $10,750. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and how much you've already come down."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,750 is still a bit lower than what I'd like, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,875.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.
