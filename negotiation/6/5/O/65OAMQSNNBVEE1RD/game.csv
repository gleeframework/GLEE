"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's valued at $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $10,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This feels like a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,750 is still a bit lower than what I'd like, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,875.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",10875.0,Alice,5,
