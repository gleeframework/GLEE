"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $7,000. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. However, $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I could do. Would you consider $8,000? I think that's a fair offer and would allow me to make the purchase.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $8,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking $9,250. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget. I can do $8,500 to make this work, but that's really the absolute highest I can go.  What do you say?",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $8,500. I'm still a bit far from my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $9,000, and that's as low as I can go. It's a good price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",9000.0,Alice,7,
