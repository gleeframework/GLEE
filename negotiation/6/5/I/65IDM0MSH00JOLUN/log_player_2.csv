Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value our potential partnership,  $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This would allow me to make the deal work and still give you a good price.  Let me know what you think.
