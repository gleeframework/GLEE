,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see the value of this product for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible. While I appreciate the compromise, $1,300,000 is still a little outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  It's my final offer, let's see if we can make it work.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $1,250,000, but I'm not quite ready to sell yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'll offer it to you for $1,280,000.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,280,000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,250,000. It's a fair price for both of us.  If you're not ready to accept it, I might have to look at other options.",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're sticking to your previous offer, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll meet you at the midpoint of our previous offers. I'll offer it to you for $1,275,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make it work.",1275000.0,Alice,7,
