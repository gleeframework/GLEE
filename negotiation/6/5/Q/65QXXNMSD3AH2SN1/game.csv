"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $15500?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $16500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your original offer and my initial counteroffer, so I'd like to propose $16250. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",16250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $16250. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll sell it to you for $17000, which is still a bit above my minimum price but below your initial offer. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15500 and $17000, which would be $16250. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",16250.0,Bob,6,
