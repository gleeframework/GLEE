"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. It's worth exploring if he can get an even better price by counter-offering.  He has 9 more rounds to negotiate, so there's time to try and squeeze a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to push Alice towards a lower price quickly.  A $50,000 reduction is substantial, and he'll see how Alice reacts.  He wants to see if she's willing to negotiate seriously and find a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $900,000 to $875,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  This is a decent deal for Bob, and he doesn't want to risk losing a good price by continuing to counter-offer.  He still has 7 rounds left if he wants to try and get a lower price, but there's no guarantee Alice will keep lowering her price."
