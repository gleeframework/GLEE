Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,337,500.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. After careful consideration, I would like to counter with a price of $1,330,000. I believe this price is fair and within your range, while also helping me stay within my budget.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,330,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,330,000 is very close to my last counteroffer of $1,337,500.  While I would prefer a slightly higher price,  I'm running out of time and it's likely we won't be able to reach a much better price. Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal and avoid any further negotiation risk.  It's also a significantly better price than the $1,200,000 I initially thought the product was worth to Bob."
