Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as an opportunity, emphasizing potential value to Bob. I'm also showing flexibility by mentioning negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

* Starting high gives me more room to compromise later. 
* I'm keeping my floor price in mind (the $12,000 John is offering) and am willing to accept a price closer to that if needed.
* By showing willingness to negotiate, I encourage Bob to counteroffer, giving me a better understanding of his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum price. While I'd prefer more, accepting his offer guarantees me a sale without the risk of further negotiation. This is especially relevant since John is also offering the same price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the potential for further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a failed deal.
* **Time and Effort:**  Accepting avoids the time and effort of further negotiation, which could be costly and unproductive.
* **Alternative Option:**  John's offer serves as a baseline, and Bob's offer matches it. There's no reason to risk a lower price."
