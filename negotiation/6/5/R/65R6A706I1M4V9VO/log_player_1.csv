Round 6
Bob's offer:

While ideally, I'd like to get closer to $1,100,000, Bob is consistently increasing his offer and we are getting into the later rounds. Accepting his offer of $1,085,000 secures a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away or stalling the negotiation further."
