"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That's a fair price that reflects the value this product brings.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  Let's meet in the middle again and see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
