"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it's worth $12,000 to you, and to make it a worthwhile investment for both of us, I'm initially offering it at $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He has a maximum budget of $12,000 and Alice's offer is too high. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That's a fair price that reflects the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer again.  While $11,000 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, there's still room for negotiation and Bob can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  Let's meet in the middle again and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  It seems we're getting closer. How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,875? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $10,875 is within his budget and getting closer to his desired price.  While there's always the possibility of negotiating further, it's likely that Alice won't budge much more and Bob risks losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
