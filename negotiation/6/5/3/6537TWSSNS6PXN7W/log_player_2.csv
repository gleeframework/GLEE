{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is above your budget.  It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This shows that I'm serious about negotiating and I'm willing to walk away if necessary. It's a good starting point to see how Alice responds and if she's willing to come down in price."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to try to negotiate further by making another counteroffer. John's offer is still a backup option, but I'm hoping to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $950,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still not willing to meet her price. It's a reasonable compromise that could potentially lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally come down to my maximum price of $1,000,000.  It's not ideal that I'm not getting a lower price, but it's the best deal I can get at this point. Accepting Alice's offer avoids the risk of further negotiations and guarantees I get the product within my budget."
