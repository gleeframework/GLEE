Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to maximize my potential profit. It's also important to remember that John is willing to pay $1,000,000, so I have a safety net if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, it's still below my target and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm countering with $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer and closer to my ideal price point. I believe this is a fair compromise that could lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still going to reject it. I believe I can get closer to $1,000,000 with another counteroffer. It's a risky move, but with John as a safety net, I can afford to be a little more persistent."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it's the minimum price I'm willing to accept.  It's also the same price John is willing to pay, so I'm not risking anything by sticking to this price."
