"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider this offer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? I'm confident this price is fair considering the value you place on the product.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,250, which would be $9,875. Can you consider this offer?",9875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,875 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $10,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
