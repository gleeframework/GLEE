Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product at a discounted price of $9,500.  I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, offering it to Bob first gives me a chance to potentially make even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $9,500 is:
    *  Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) to ensure I'm aiming for the best possible profit.
    *  Lower than my guaranteed sale price ($10,000) to make it enticing for Bob to consider.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** There's a chance Bob might counter-offer, giving me an opportunity to adjust and still potentially land a sale above $10,000."
