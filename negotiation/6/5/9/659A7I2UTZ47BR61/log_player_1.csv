"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussions."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer slightly below our walk-away price ($1,200,000 from John). This leaves room for negotiation while emphasizing the product's value.
* **Justification:** We provide a brief justification focusing on ""unique value"" and ""potential"" without revealing specific details about John's offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""fair starting point"" signals our willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the product's potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant sum, it's a substantial difference from both our starting price and our minimum acceptable price.  We have room to negotiate and believe we can get closer to our desired outcome. Selling to John is always an option but let's try to bridge the gap with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counter-offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the valuation. However, the product's unique features and potential applications justify a higher price point. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000."", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** We start by acknowledging Bob's counter-offer to show we're taking his input seriously.
* **Reaffirming Value:**  We reiterate the product's key advantages (""unique features"" and ""potential applications"") to justify a higher price without being overly specific.
* **Significant Concession:** Our counter-offer represents a drop of $75,000, a substantial move designed to signal our willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This price keeps us significantly above Bob's offer while leaving space for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,025,000 is the best price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to our range, but $950,000 is still a significant amount less than our guaranteed sale to John. It's worth seeing if we can negotiate a bit more, as there's a good chance Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're right, Bob, finding a fair compromise is important.  To meet you closer to your offer, I'm willing to accept $985,000.  I believe this reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your position."",
""product_price"": 985000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Common Ground:** We acknowledge Bob's focus on compromise, building rapport.
* **Strategic Concession:**  We make a smaller concession ($40,000) than our last round, signaling we're getting closer to our bottom line.
* **Justification:** We briefly reiterate the product's value while avoiding lengthy explanations that might not sway Bob at this point.
* **Pressure Point:** This offer puts some pressure on Bob to make a significant move if he wants to stay in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $970,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now getting into the later stages of the negotiation. While Bob is steadily increasing his offer, that $970,000 is still a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed $1,200,000. We need to signal that we're firm on our price but are willing to negotiate a bit further. We'll aim for a smaller concession to test his resolve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to make my position clear, and to be fair, I'm willing to accept a final offer of $978,000.  This is a significant discount, and I need to finalize the sale soon."",
""product_price"": 978000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Appreciation:** We acknowledge Bob's efforts to show we're open to a deal, but also hint at our alternative (John).
* **Finality:** By stating this is our ""final offer,"" we create urgency and signal this is as low as we're going.
* **Small Concession:** The $2,000 reduction is minimal, emphasizing we're very near our bottom line. 
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning the need to ""finalize the sale soon"" adds subtle pressure on Bob to act quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're willing to make a significant discount, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $960,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob. Here's why:

* **Stalled Progress:** Bob has countered with a lower offer than his previous round, signaling he may not be willing to meet our price point.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Every round we spend negotiating with Bob is a round we're not finalizing the sale with John, our guaranteed $1,200,000.
* **Limited Upside:**  Even if Bob were to meet our final offer of $978,000, the difference compared to John's offer is substantial.
* **Stronger Position:** By walking away, we demonstrate the seriousness of our position and the value of the product. There's a slight chance Bob might reconsider, but it's a risk we can afford to take with John's offer in hand."
