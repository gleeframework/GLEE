{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you're interested in. I'm offering it to you for $135. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but not excessively high, leaving room for negotiation. The friendly message aims to establish a positive rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  I'm happy to pay $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is a decent price, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try to push for a higher price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to go down to $120, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
