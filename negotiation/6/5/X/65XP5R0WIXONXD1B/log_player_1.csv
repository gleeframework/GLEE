Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to negotiate,  $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if we can get closer to a mutually beneficial price before considering selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a significant discount from my original offer. This is a price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit while remaining competitive. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,200,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I believe we have a good chance of closing the deal with a bit more negotiation.  I'm willing to accept this offer and move forward."
