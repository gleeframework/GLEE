"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident this price is fair considering the value it holds for you.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a significant discount from my original offer. This is a price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit while remaining competitive. Let's see if we can make this work.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,200,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
