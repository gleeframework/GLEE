"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is quite low for this product. It's high-quality and really useful. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's value, Alice, but $140 is still above my budget. How about we settle at $100? That's a fair compromise.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we split the difference between your last offer and mine, and settle at $120? That's my final offer.",120.0,Alice,5,
