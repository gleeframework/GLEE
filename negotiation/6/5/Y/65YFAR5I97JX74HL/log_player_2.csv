"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is willing to sell for at least $8,000. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is still a good deal for Alice, as it's above her minimum price of $8,000. It also leaves some room for further negotiation if she rejects my offer."
