"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to pass up.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm quite interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's worth and is a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $750,000. Would you be willing to consider that figure?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering your eagerness to reach a deal, I'm willing to offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value to you and my initial asking price. I'm confident this price will satisfy both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
