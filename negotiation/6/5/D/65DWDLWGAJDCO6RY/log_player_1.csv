Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth in the market."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, it's always best to try for a higher profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000  creates a win-win situation:
    * **For Bob:** He gets the product for $150,000 less than its perceived value to him.
    * **For Alice:** She earns $150,000 more than John's offer.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message hints at the product's high demand and Bob's privileged position as the first recipient of the offer. This might encourage him to accept quickly."
