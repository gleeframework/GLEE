"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1000000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1050000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a reasonable deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $1080000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me halfway. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
