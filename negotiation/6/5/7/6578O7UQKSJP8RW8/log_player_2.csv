"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is still above his maximum budget, it's a good starting point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible deal. While Alice's offer is closer to his budget, he can likely still negotiate a lower price. He'll reject the offer and try for a lower counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident I can secure the product for $825,000. This price is closer to my budget and would allow us to both walk away satisfied. "", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is close to his goal of getting the product for under $800,000. He's only $50,000 away from his ideal price and he's already rejected Alice's offer twice.  He has more rounds to go, and he's willing to risk it for that extra $50,000 savings.  He'll try one more counteroffer to see if he can get Alice to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $835,000. It's a good compromise and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 835000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to sell the product for $845,000. This is the final price I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $845,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $845,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering $845,000, which is still above Bob's goal of $800,000.  He's already made several counteroffers and hasn't been able to get Alice lower.  At this point, it's better for Bob to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $800,000.  He's been close to this price several times and it seems unlikely Alice will go any lower."
