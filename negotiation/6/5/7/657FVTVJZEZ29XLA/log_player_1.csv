Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and features, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $15,000."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, it's always worth aiming higher initially. Starting at $15,000 allows room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes ""unique value"" to justify the high price, even though you know Bob values it less. 
* **Risk Assessment:** There's a chance Bob might accept the $15,000, netting you a higher profit. If he rejects it, you still have your guaranteed sale to John."
