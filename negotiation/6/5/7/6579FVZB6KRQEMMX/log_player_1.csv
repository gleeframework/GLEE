Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting at $1,600,000, you're aiming for a price that's significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. While it's unlikely he'll accept this initial offer, it sets the stage for a negotiation that could land you well above your $1,200,000 goal. 
* **Alternative Option:** You always have the security of John's offer, so you can afford to be more ambitious in your negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay that amount, but I need to see if we can come to an agreement on that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his maximum budget, and it's significantly below your minimum. Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to John's offer.  It's worth negotiating further to see if you can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, the value of this product is significant. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction but Above Minimum:** This counteroffer shows flexibility by dropping $150,000, but it's still considerably higher than Bob's offer and comfortably above your absolute minimum. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value, you're reminding Bob why it's worth negotiating for. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will gauge Bob's willingness to move substantially from his initial price. It leaves room for further negotiation if needed, while still keeping the option of selling to John open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of $1,000,000. It's the maximum I can afford, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is Firm:** Bob has now repeated his maximum offer twice. It's highly unlikely he'll budge from $1,000,000.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer of $1,200,000 guarantees you a profit and avoids the risk of further unsuccessful negotiation with Bob. 
* **Time Value:** Continuing with Bob might be a waste of time that could be spent pursuing other opportunities or closing the deal with John."
