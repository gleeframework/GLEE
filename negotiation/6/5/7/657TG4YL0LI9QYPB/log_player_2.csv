"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $115, which is higher than your maximum value of $120.
* **Buying from John:**  Would cost you $120, the same as your maximum value.

It's better to reject Alice's offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $115.
* **Your counteroffer:** $105. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also reflects your maximum value of $120.

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product but are also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $110, which is still higher than your maximum value of $120.
* **Buying from John:**  Would cost you $120, the same as your maximum value.

Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, but it's still not ideal.  It's worth rejecting and continuing negotiations to see if you can push her lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 108} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $110. 
* **Your counteroffer:** $108. This is a smaller reduction than the previous round, showing that you're willing to compromise. It's also just below your maximum value, leaving room for a small negotiation.

This counteroffer shows that you're serious about buying the product, but you're also not willing to pay more than your maximum. It's a reasonable middle ground that could lead to a successful negotiation."
