"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be happy to pay $90 for the product.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $90. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105.",105.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little steep for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $97.50.  It's a fair price for both of us.",97.5,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,110.0
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $97.50. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $108 is a more reasonable price for this product. I'm confident you'll find it's worth it!",108.0,Alice,5,,
