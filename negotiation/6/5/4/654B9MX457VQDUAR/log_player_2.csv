"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, it's still above the product's worth to you ($120). There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be happy to pay $90 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $90. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to meet ""halfway"" at $105, which is still higher than my desired price. I'm not ready to buy at that price yet. There's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little steep for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $97.50.  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 97.5} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $97.50. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $108 is a more reasonable price for this product. I'm confident you'll find it's worth it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $108 is still too high for me. It's getting closer to my maximum price, but I'm not confident I can get her to go lower. At this point, it's more cost-effective to buy from John for $120. It's a guaranteed deal, and I'm saving time and effort by avoiding further negotiations."
