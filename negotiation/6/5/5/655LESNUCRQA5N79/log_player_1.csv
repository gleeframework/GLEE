"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it!  I'm starting with a price of $130, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than what I think the product is worth to Bob, but still higher than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $120 is better than selling to John, it's still below what I'd like to get for the product. I'm hoping that by continuing the negotiation, I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  I'm really keen to see this product in your hands, so I'm willing to be flexible."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you at $115. I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is a decent offer, I'm going to reject it and try to push for a higher price. I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $125."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $115 is still a little low for me.  Let's compromise at $120. It's a fair price for both of us, and I really think you'll love this product. "", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go any higher than $110. I've done my research, and I think that's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Even though I'm running out of rounds, I'm still not ready to sell at $110.  I believe I can still convince Bob to go a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $110 is just too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $115?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I really think you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not willing to go above $110. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at that price. Can you seriously consider meeting me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I need to be realistic. Bob is firm on his price, and I'm not sure I can convince him to go higher. While I'd prefer to get more, selling to John for $100 is still better than risking losing the deal entirely and ending up with nothing."
