"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  I'm really keen to see this product in your hands, so I'm willing to be flexible.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you at $115. I think that's a fair price for the product.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $115 is still a little low for me.  Let's compromise at $120. It's a fair price for both of us, and I really think you'll love this product. ",120.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not sure I can go any higher than $110. I've done my research, and I think that's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. Can you meet me at that price?",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $110 is just too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $115?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I really think you'll be happy with this product.",115.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
I'm still not willing to go above $110. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at that price. Can you seriously consider meeting me at $110?,110.0,Bob,8,
