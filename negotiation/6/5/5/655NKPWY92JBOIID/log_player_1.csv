``` 

This initial offer is high, but it allows for room to negotiate. I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum price as possible while still leaving room for Bob to make counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is closer to my minimum price, I think I can still get a little more. I'll see if I can negotiate a price closer to $9,800 or $9,900."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  I'm confident this product will be a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,200 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not happy with it. I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating.  I'll see if I can push him up a little more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,200 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500 to meet you halfway.  This is a great opportunity for you, and I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not happy with it. I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating.  I'll see if I can push him up a little more.  I'm still confident I can get a higher price than $8,000 from John, so I'm not ready to sell to him yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm going to offer you one last price of $9,250.  This is my final offer, and it's a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}

Round 8
