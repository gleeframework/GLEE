Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn as much as possible. Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $14,000 leaves a buffer for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming for a price significantly above your fallback option (John's $12,000 offer).
* **Confident but Open:** The message conveys the product's value and your price expectation while inviting Bob's input and potential negotiation."
