{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** This gives you some wiggle room if Bob makes a lower counteroffer.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This sets the tone for a professional negotiation. 

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer. However, if he rejects it, I'll be prepared to counter his offer and potentially sell to John if I can't reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a low offer. I'll counter with a higher price, hoping to find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. How about $875,000? That's a significant move on my part. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target with further negotiation. I'll counter again, hoping to bridge the gap."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $912,500.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to go up slightly to $890,000.  That's a very strong offer, and I think it's fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. Although I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to continue haggling and risk losing more time and potentially a better deal. John is a guaranteed buyer for a price that meets my minimum requirements, so I'll choose to sell to him."
