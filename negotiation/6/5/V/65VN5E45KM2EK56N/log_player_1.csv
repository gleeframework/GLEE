"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with a strong offer above your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and might prompt Bob to counter with a higher offer than he might have otherwise. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  The high initial offer also helps gauge how interested Bob is. If he immediately rejects it outright, it suggests his valuation might be significantly lower.
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, we always have the option to walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000. It's good to keep this in mind as a fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is better than our fallback option of selling to John for $1,500,000. However, it's still significantly below our initial ask and our product's potential value to us.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about a higher price and encourage Bob to potentially increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?"",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** By counter-offering with $1,700,000, we are suggesting a compromise while still maintaining a price significantly above Bob's initial offer and our fallback option. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  We are reiterating the product's value to encourage Bob to see it from our perspective.  
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving forward and leaves room for Bob to counter again, potentially bringing us closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you believe the product has exceptional value, but I still think $1,400,000 is a fair price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,400,000 and $1,700,000, which would be $1,550,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is now above our guaranteed sale price to John ($1,500,000). While we could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might reduce his offer or walk away entirely. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit above our fallback option and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
