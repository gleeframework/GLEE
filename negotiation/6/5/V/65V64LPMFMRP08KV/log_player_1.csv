Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than Bob's maximum value, but it gives me a significant profit. I'm confident that I can negotiate further if Bob rejects it. However, I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob's counteroffers aren't acceptable, as I have a guaranteed $10,000 offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly less than my initial offer. I'm confident I can get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a profit closer to my initial goal.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to consider selling to John."
