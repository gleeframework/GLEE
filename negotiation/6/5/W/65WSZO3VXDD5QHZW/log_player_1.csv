"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, and it allows me to see if Bob is seriously interested in buying the product.  I'm also aware that I can always go to John for $15,000, so I'm not overly anxious to close the deal immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'll see if I can get him to move closer to $20,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

I'm reducing my price slightly to $19,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a little more.  Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I think I can still squeeze out a better deal.  I'll see if I can get him to budge a little more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway this round. $18,500 is a compromise, and I think it's a reasonable price for both of us. I'm hoping this will be enough to get Bob to accept the offer. If he rejects it again, I'm getting very close to accepting John's offer and moving on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close to my minimum, but I'm not sure Bob is going to budge much further. I don't want to risk another round and end up with John's offer, so I'm going to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John. It's not the ideal outcome, but it's a good deal considering the circumstances."
