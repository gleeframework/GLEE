"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $700,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $750,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",750000.0,Bob,4,
