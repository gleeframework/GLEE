Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $700,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $750,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's hesitant to reach my minimum price. John's guaranteed offer of $800,000 makes more sense at this point, avoiding further negotiation and potential loss."
