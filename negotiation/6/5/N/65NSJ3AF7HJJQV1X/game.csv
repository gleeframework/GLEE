"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $1,050,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,050,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,250,000. This price still represents a significant value for you, and it allows me to make a more reasonable profit.  Let me know if this is something you can work with.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,150,000? I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,150,000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  It allows us both to reach an agreement that works. Let me know if you're ready to close the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
