"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this unique product.  I value it highly, but I'm open to a mutually beneficial agreement.  To start the conversation, I propose a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,500,000) to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** The initial offer provides room for Bob to negotiate down, making him feel more in control of the process. 
* **Confident Tone:** My message implies the product's value while showing a willingness to negotiate.

This strategy balances ambition with flexibility, increasing the chances of a favorable outcome for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,400,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, accepting now would leave a substantial portion of potential profit on the table. Bob's counteroffer suggests he's willing to go higher than his initial bid. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal by strategically countering.  Selling to John at this point would be a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to let it go for $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Hold Firm, but Show Flexibility:** I'm holding firm above Bob's offer, signaling the product's worth, but showing flexibility by coming down in price.
* **""Meet in the Middle"":** This framing technique aims to create a sense of fairness and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **Strategic Concession:**  The $50,000 decrease from my initial offer is significant enough to encourage Bob's engagement while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,300,000.  Let's close this deal and avoid going back and forth any further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close, but I believe Bob has more room to move.  He's increasing his offers in smaller increments, suggesting he's nearing his limit, but his ""let's close this deal"" comment implies urgency on his part. This is a good sign for me, and I'm willing to risk another round to try and secure a slightly better price.   Selling to John would be a significant loss at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference - $1,325,000, and we have a deal?"",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  This offer splits the difference between his previous offer and my last counteroffer.  It suggests strong willingness to close the deal from my side. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By framing it as a final offer, I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency, hoping to nudge Bob towards accepting rather than risking the deal falling through.
* **Profitable Outcome:** This price still represents a significant profit margin for me, keeping the deal highly appealing."
