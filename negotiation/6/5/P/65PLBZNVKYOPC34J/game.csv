"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000 for this product. This price still leaves you a significant profit and is closer to what I'm willing to spend. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000.  This price is fair, considering the value to both of us, and I believe it would be a good deal for both parties.",850000.0,Bob,4,
