The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, so he should reject Alice's offer of $12,000. He can try to get a better price by counteroffering."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $11,000, which is still within his budget.  There is no guarantee that he can get a better offer from Alice, and if he rejects again, he might end up having to pay $10,000 to John. So, it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer in this round."
