"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  It's too early to go to John yet, as there's still potential for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about $10,500? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not quite willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11,250? I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than what Bob wants to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can likely push for a lower price in the next round.  Buying from John is still an option, but it's too early to give up on a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $11,250 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit lower.  How about $11,000?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about $11,500? I think that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that $11,500 is her bottom line.  While Bob would prefer a lower price, it's getting close to his target.  Accepting this offer secures the product for a price significantly lower than John's offer, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether."
