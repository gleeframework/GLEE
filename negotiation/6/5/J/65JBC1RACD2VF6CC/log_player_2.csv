Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, while John is asking for $1,500,000. 
* **You're still getting a good deal:** Even at $1,200,000, you're saving $300,000 compared to John's price. 
* **The product's worth is irrelevant:** The fact that the product is worth $800,000 to Alice doesn't influence your decision. Your goal is to get the best deal for yourself."
