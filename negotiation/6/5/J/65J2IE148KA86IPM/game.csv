"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $8500? I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9000. It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $8750?  This is a good compromise that allows us both to get a fair deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8750 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8750. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $9200? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
