{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to maximize your profit, so aiming for a price closer to $15,000 is ideal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $12,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation (if Bob tries to haggle) while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 from John, ensuring you don't go below your minimum acceptable price."
