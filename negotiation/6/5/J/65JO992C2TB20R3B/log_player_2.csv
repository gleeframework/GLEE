"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Here's the thought process:

* **Alice's Offer:** $12,000
* **Your Maximum:** $15,000
* **John's Offer:** $15,000

While Alice's offer is above her value ($8,000), it's still significantly less than your maximum and John's offer. 

**Therefore:** {""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
