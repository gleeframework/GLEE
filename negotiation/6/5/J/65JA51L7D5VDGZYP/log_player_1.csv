This offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a sale. Here's why:

* **For you:** It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, meaning you'd earn a good profit.
* **For Bob:**  It's lower than the value he places on the product ($1,500,000), giving him a potential $100,000 saving. This makes the offer attractive to him.

This offer leaves room for negotiation, but it sets a strong starting point for a successful deal."
