I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get close to my ideal price."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $12,000 is a good offer, but I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I think it's a fair price, but if Bob isn't willing to go higher, I'm prepared to sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

Bob's offer of $12,500 is getting closer to my ideal price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate. It's a good price, and it's worth settling for."
