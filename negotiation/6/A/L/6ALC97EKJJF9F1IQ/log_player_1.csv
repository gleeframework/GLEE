Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  I emphasize the potential benefit for Bob, making it more appealing for him to consider.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm open to negotiation, but I'm also prepared to walk away and get my minimum price from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, based on my assessment, I am only able to offer $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below the $1,000,000 value I need. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. A counteroffer might incentivize Bob to come closer to my desired price.
* **Not desperate:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'm willing to lower my offer to $875,000. This reflects the value of the product to you while leaving me some room to make a profit. Let's see if we can find a common ground here."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet Bob halfway:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my offer to $875,000, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining profit margin:** This price is still higher than Bob's initial offer and above his perceived value, so it's still profitable for me.
* **Maintaining pressure:** By mentioning a target price and leaving some room for negotiation, I'm indicating that I'm not desperate to sell, which could incentivize Bob to move closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I would like to meet somewhere in the middle, I must stick to my budget. I propose an offer of $860,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a stalemate:** Bob's offer is only $10,000 higher than his initial offer. It seems we've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significant increase.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take longer and might not result in a price closer to my desired value.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which meets my minimum requirement and ensures a good profit.

By selling to John, I avoid further negotiation, save time, and secure a price that meets my financial goals."
