"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Approach:** A friendly message makes Bob feel valued and more likely to engage. 
* **Room for Compromise:** $100 leaves space for a few rounds of counter-offers without dropping below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum.**  While I want to make a deal, selling for $85 would be a loss for me.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I can still counter-offer and try to reach a price closer to my minimum.
* **Keeping Options Open:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating or, if necessary, sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $85 is a good offer, I need to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about $95?  It's still a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer to keep the negotiation going.
* **Middle Ground:** $95 is a compromise between Bob's offer and my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I remind Bob that the price is still fair by highlighting the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited Time:**  We're already in round 4, and I'm running out of time to negotiate a better deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I'd prefer $120, there's no guarantee I'll get a higher counteroffer from Bob, and I risk losing the sale altogether. Selling to John is an option, but $90 is still a decent profit."
