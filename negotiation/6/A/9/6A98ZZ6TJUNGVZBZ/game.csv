"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $11,750 for the product.",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $11,750 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $11,000.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,900?",10900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $10,900, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about $11,350? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",11350.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to move a bit. How about $11,100?",11100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to move, Bob. I'm still a bit above my target, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,600? I think that's a fair price for the product's value to me.",11600.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"This is getting a bit frustrating, Alice.  We both know this is getting close to a point where I should just go with John.  My last offer is $11,000.  Take it or leave it.",11000.0,Bob,8,
