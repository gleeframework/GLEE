"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You're trying to save as much money as possible and $950,000 is still well above the product's worth to you.  There's room for negotiation. You'll likely be able to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer, aiming to quickly establish a negotiating range.  $700,000 is a substantial discount from Alice's initial offer and is still well within my budget. This will likely cause Alice to reject my offer, but it will also signal my serious intent to negotiate and hopefully get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's slightly lower than her initial offer, it's still significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better price. I'm not yet at the point where buying from John is a better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $750,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still emphasizes that I believe a lower price is more reasonable. It's a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's last offer.  I hope this will prompt Alice to come down further in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's a little lower than her previous offer, it's still well above what I'm willing to pay. I'm not yet at the point where I'd accept her offer. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better price. Buying from John is still a worse option for me at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again to $800,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise further. This is close to her minimum acceptable price, and hopefully, she will consider it. I'm still within my budget and can afford to go a little higher if needed, but I want to see if we can reach an agreement at this point.  It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn."
