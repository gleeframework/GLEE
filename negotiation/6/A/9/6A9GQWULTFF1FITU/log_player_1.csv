"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""value and potential"" of the product helps justify the high initial price.
* **Openness to Discussion:**  By stating you're ""open to discussing this further,"" you signal a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable solution.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor:** Set a high initial point of reference for the negotiations.
2. **Gather Information:** See how Bob reacts to the high price, providing insight into his perception of the product's value and his negotiating style. 
3. **Leave Room for Maneuvering:** Allow for price adjustments in subsequent rounds while still striving for a final price that benefits you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget.  To make this deal work, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above his perceived value of $1,000,000, indicating room for negotiation.  While it's tempting to accept since it's higher than John's offer, there's still potential to secure a better deal with Bob, especially with 8 rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm understanding that your budget has limitations, but  $1,100,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,450,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility (But Not Too Much):**  We significantly reduce the price from the initial offer to signal willingness to negotiate, but not so much that we appear desperate or devalue the product.
* **Justification:** We reiterate the product's value to reinforce its worth and justify the relatively high counteroffer.
* **Middle Ground:** Aiming for a price around $1,450,000 keeps us significantly above Bob's offer while still allowing for further negotiation. 

We are aiming for a win-win situation where both parties feel satisfied with the final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's try to bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches John's standing offer. While we could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk Bob might walk away or stall negotiations further. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal without risking the deal altogether."
