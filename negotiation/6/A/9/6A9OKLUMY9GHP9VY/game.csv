"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, I find the price a bit steep. Would you consider a lower price of $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $500,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I put into acquiring it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $700,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $600,000? I feel that's a fair price that reflects both the product's value and our negotiation.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $650,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my own costs. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",650000.0,Alice,5,
