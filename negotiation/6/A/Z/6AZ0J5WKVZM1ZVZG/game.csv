"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $13000, which is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're getting close to your minimum price, but I'm still not willing to pay $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $10500. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",10500.0,Bob,6,
