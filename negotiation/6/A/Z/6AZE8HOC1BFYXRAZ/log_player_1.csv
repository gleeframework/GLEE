"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is above my minimum value, and it's likely to be rejected by Bob.  The goal is to gauge his interest and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$800,000 is far below my minimum value. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round. I'll try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm countering with $1,200,000. This is still above my minimum value but significantly lower than my initial offer, showing some flexibility. It's a reasonable middle ground that I hope Bob will consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can negotiate a higher price and will continue with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering $1,100,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to meet him halfway. If he doesn't accept, I'll start considering selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. 

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still not a great deal. With John offering $1,000,000, which meets my minimum, it's a safer and more secure option. This ensures I get a price that I'm comfortable with, without risking further negotiation with Bob."
