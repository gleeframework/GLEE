``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:** Even though Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000, Alice's offer of $14,000 saves him $1,000. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer is worse:**  Rejecting Alice's offer would mean buying from John for $15,000, which is the maximum Bob is willing to pay."
