Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $12,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $12,000. This is a compromise between my minimum value of $15,000 and Bob's maximum value of $10,000. 
* **Message:** I'm trying to incentivize Bob to accept by framing it as a ""great deal"" and highlighting its potential value to him. 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to maximize my chances of getting a sale from Bob while still securing a good price. If he rejects, I can comfortably fall back on John's offer, ensuring I don't lose out."
