,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit high, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still a little too much for me. How about we settle on $110? I'm serious about getting this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $115. I'm willing to give you a small concession, though. I'll meet you at $112.50. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you trying to work with me. I'm still a little hesitant at $112.50.  How about we split the difference and settle on $111.25? This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal now.",111.25,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go above $112.50. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $112.00. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",112.0,Alice,7,
