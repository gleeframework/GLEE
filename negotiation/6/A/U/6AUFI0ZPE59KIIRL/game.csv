"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your position, the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't go as low as $850,000. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $900,000 is still a little high for me, but I'm willing to go to $875,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy we're finding some common ground.  How about we meet in the middle at $887,500? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",887500.0,Alice,5,
