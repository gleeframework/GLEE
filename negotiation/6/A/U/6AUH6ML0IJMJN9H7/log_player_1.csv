Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we'd ideally like to get closer to $1,000,000, Bob is clearly demonstrating price sensitivity at this point. $975,000 is a substantial profit, and continuing to negotiate risks him walking away entirely. It's better to secure a very good deal than risk getting stuck with John's lower offer."
