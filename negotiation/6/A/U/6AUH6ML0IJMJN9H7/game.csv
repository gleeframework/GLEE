"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $950,000 is a more reasonable price for this product. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to what I have in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $990,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",990000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $990,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider this?",975000.0,Bob,6,
