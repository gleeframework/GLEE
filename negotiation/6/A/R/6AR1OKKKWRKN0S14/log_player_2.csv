# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1250000.  It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. If you decline, I have another buyer ready to pay the full asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than the full value of the product, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is the best possible outcome for Bob."
