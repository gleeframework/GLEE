"Alice, your product is great, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm confident I can get it for less elsewhere. How about $1,300,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I have to make a profit. I can do $1,350,000, and that's as low as I can go. It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with it.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $1,325,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
