"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$100 is a good price, but I'm trying to save as much money as possible.  I want to see if I can get Alice to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see how much Alice is willing to budge. $80 is a good starting point, as it's a 20% discount from Alice's initial offer.  I'm hoping she'll accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, but $90 is still above my target price. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if I can get closer to my goal of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, so I'm going to meet her halfway by offering $85. This is a reasonable compromise, and I think there's a good chance she'll accept it.  If not, I'm prepared to go another round or two, but I'm getting close to my price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting close to my target price.  While I'd love to get it down to $85, $87 is a good deal and I'm confident I can't get a significantly better price with only 5 rounds left.  If I keep going, I might risk missing out on this opportunity and having to buy from John for $150."
