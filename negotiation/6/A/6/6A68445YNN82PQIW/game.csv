"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a little high for me. I'm prepared to offer $12,000. If we can agree on that price, we can finalize the deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
