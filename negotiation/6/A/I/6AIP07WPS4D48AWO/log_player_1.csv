Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $17,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By saying I'm ""open to negotiation,"" I signal flexibility and encourage Bob to counter-offer. 
* **Maintaining My Value:**  Even though Bob's willingness to pay is $15,000, I still want to make a profit.  My starting offer reflects this. 
* **The Backup Plan:**  I'm aware that I can sell to John for $15,000, so I have a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. I'll counter-offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $14,000 to make this work. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if that's acceptable to you."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($17,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000). This shows good faith and a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce the price point. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  I'm suggesting that this is the best price I can offer, implying that we need to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $14000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I would prefer more, I'm willing to accept it to avoid the risk of losing a deal altogether.  It's also better than selling to John for $15,000, as I'm saving on any potential costs associated with that sale."
