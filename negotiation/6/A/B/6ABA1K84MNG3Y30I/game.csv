"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while still being a reasonable investment for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Can you consider this offer?",14000.0,Bob,4,
