{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $800,000. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I absolutely need ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the value the product holds for Bob, reminding him of the potential profit he can make.
* **Collaborative Tone:** I use a friendly and collaborative tone to encourage negotiation and build a positive relationship."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product is high to you, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about we aim for $1,200,000? This would allow us to work towards a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept a deal that leaves me with less than my minimum. 

I'll counteroffer to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still allows you a substantial profit, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but demonstrating flexibility by offering a counteroffer closer to his proposal.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize the profit Bob can still make at $1,600,000, appealing to his financial interests. 
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:** I continue to use a friendly and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. This is still below your initial asking price, but it's a step closer to my maximum budget. I hope this can help us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $1,500,000 I can get from John.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for less than my minimum just yet. I'll counteroffer to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to reach a deal. While $1,400,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. To move things forward, I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, but it shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price, but I'm also staying close to my minimum to ensure a good return.
* **Highlight Compromise:** I explicitly mention this is a ""significant compromise"" to emphasize that I'm serious about reaching a deal.
* **Maintain Positive Tone:** I continue to use a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to reciprocate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest proposal, Alice. I appreciate your effort in coming down to $1,550,000. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a final price of $1,450,000. This would allow us to close the gap and reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob is getting closer to my minimum, his offer is still below the $1,500,000 I can get from John. With only a few rounds remaining, it's not worth risking a lower price when I have a guaranteed buyer who is willing to pay my minimum. 

Selling to John guarantees me the best possible outcome in this scenario."
