Since you are aiming to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

You're still trying to save as much as possible.  Rejecting Alice's offer again and making a counteroffer keeps you in the negotiation and might lead to a price closer to your target."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8750 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8,600?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to make a decision today."", ""product_price"": 8600}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I'm still a bit far from meeting your price. I can offer it to you for $8700. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:

This time, it's worth accepting Alice's offer. You've successfully negotiated the price down from $9,000 to $8,700, which is a good savings.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might walk away or that John might not be available anymore.  It's generally a good strategy to take a deal that is close to your target, especially when you've already made significant progress."
