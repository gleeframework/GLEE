"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your perspective on the price. While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could we settle around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I could consider coming down to $9,000.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
