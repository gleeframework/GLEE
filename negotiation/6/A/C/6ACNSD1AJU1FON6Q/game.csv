"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $13,500. Would you be interested in that?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I like the spirit of compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,500. I can do $14,000, which is a bit higher than my last offer, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. Let me know if that works for you!",14000.0,Alice,5,
