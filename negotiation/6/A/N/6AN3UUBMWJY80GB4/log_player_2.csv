"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $16,000 to start the negotiations. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for such a valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $14,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
