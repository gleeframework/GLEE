**Reasoning:**

Alice seems firmly stuck around $950,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a real risk she won't budge. Buying from John for $1,200,000 is a significant loss compared to my ideal price, but it's better than getting stuck in endless negotiation with Alice and potentially missing out entirely."
