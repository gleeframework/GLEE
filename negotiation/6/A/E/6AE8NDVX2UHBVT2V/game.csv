"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

"Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $9500, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10200. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",10200.0,Alice,5,
