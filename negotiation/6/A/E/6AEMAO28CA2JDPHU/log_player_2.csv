"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good price, you can potentially get it cheaper.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $70 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to make a strong first counteroffer to show that you're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $85 is very close to John's price of $80. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will continue to reject your offers or that you'll run out of rounds.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of losing out altogether."
