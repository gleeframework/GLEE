Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing the price further.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering a price of $15,000 gives us room to negotiate downward without feeling like we're giving away too much. 
* **Openness to Discussion:** Emphasizing our willingness to discuss the price shows flexibility and encourages Bob to engage in a negotiation. 
* **Knowing our Bottom Line:**  We're willing to sell to John for $12,000, so anything above that is profit.  

**Next Steps:**

We'll wait for Bob's response.  If he rejects our offer, we'll analyze his counteroffer and determine our next move based on his proposed price and our goal to maximize profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your openness to discussion. Based on my assessment, I am willing to offer $12000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly our minimum acceptable price. While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee we'll get a better price.  Since we can sell to John for the same amount, it's more efficient to accept his offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
