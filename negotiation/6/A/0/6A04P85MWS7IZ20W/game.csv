"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,750,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you consider something closer to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a fair price for both of us.  While I can't go as low as $1,100,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This offer reflects the product's value while hopefully still fitting within your budget.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting close to my limit.  I can go up to $1,150,000, but that's really the best I can do.  Let me know if that works for you.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
