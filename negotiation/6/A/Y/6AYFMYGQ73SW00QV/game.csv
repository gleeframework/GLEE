"Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
