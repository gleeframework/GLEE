"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is $80. Let's start there.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $140? This is my final offer.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still more than I can comfortably spend.  Let's try $100. This is closer to my budget, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product to me.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, taking anything less than $130 would be selling this product at a loss for me.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",130.0,Alice,5,
