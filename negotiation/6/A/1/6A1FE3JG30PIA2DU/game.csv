"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $11,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value I'll receive from the product.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $13,000.
