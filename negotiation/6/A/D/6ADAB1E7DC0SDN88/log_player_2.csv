"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to your business. I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. My minimum price is $1,000,000, but I'm open to discussing a price that benefits us both. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is above her own valuation, it's still significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and the price John offers. Accepting this offer saves you $250,000 compared to buying from John."
