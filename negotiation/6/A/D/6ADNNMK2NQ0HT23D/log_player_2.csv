Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to split the difference again. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

We're getting close to a good price, and further haggling might not yield much more savings.  It's better to secure the deal at $1,080,000 than risk the price going up or losing the opportunity altogether."
