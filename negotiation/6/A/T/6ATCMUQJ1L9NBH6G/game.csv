"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your suggestion, but I am looking to stay within my budget of $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me right now. Would you be willing to consider $9,000? That would still leave you with a good profit margin, and it would be closer to my target price.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. While $8,750 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low.  Would you consider $9,000 as a final compromise? It's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,
