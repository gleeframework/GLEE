"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its potential.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential of this product, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is worth more than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm confident the product is valuable, but $1,075,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's try $1,025,000.  It's a significant step closer to where we both need to be.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of $1,062,500. This is a compromise that's closer to your last offer, but still reflects the product's true value to me. What do you think?",1062500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts, but $1,062,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to close the deal at $1,040,000.  This is a fair price considering your original asking price and the value of the product to me. Let's make this happen.",1040000.0,Bob,6,
