"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $12,000? It's a fair price that still allows both of us to make a profit. Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit too low on budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,250. It's the best I can do, but I really like the product and think it's worth it to me.",11250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,750. It's a fair price considering your value for it, and it's a good deal for me.  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal in this round. What do you say?",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit too high on your price. I'm willing to go back to my previous offer of $11,000. I'm confident it's a fair price, and I'd love to move forward with the purchase if you're willing to meet me there.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price, but we've been going back and forth for a while now.  I'm ready to close this deal at $11,500. That's a fair price considering your value for the product, and it's a good deal for me. I'm hoping you'll consider my offer seriously. If not, I'll be moving on to other interested parties.",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're eager to close the deal, but I'm still not willing to pay $11,500. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $11,000. I'm confident it's a fair price, and I'd like to move forward with the purchase at that price.",11000.0,Bob,8,
