"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's seriousness. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" subtly justifies the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Openness:**  Expressing openness to discussion and a ""mutually beneficial agreement"" encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a little high for me, but I do see the value in the product. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your valuation and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss for you. It's worth continuing the negotiation to explore if a more agreeable price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value it brings."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** Showing you understand his perspective can help build rapport.
* **Standing Firm:** While you're lowering your price, the message emphasizes that Bob's offer was too low and reiterates the product's value. 
* **Significant Drop, But...**:  The $200,000 reduction is substantial but still keeps you well above Bob's valuation and your minimum. 
* **Justification:** By framing the new price as ""fair"" due to the product's value, you're subtly anchoring the negotiation around your terms."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the reply. I'm still very interested but $1,800,000 is outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle somewhere,  $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching Your Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to your absolute minimum, but it's still below what John is offering. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** You have six rounds remaining, and Bob seems committed to the negotiation. There's still an opportunity to secure a better price. 
* **Leverage:** You hold the advantage of a guaranteed sale with John.  This allows you to negotiate more confidently with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,400,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant compromise on my end. To be candid, I have another interested buyer, but I value our conversation and believe we can make this work. Would you consider $1,600,000? This feels like a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Honesty and Leverage:**  By mentioning another buyer without being overly aggressive, you subtly introduce a sense of urgency and highlight the product's demand.
* **""Fair Compromise"":**  You're framing your offer as a win-win solution,  encouraging Bob to reciprocate. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $1,600,000 keeps you above Bob's perceived value while still leaving room for negotiation if necessary. 
* **Limited Concessions:** You're demonstrating that your price reductions won't be endless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other offers, but I have a firm budget for this purchase. I can go up to $1,450,000, but that's absolutely my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit Reached:**  Bob has clearly stated his budget limit, and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significant price increase. 
* **Minimal Gains vs. Guaranteed Offer:** The potential gain from continuing with Bob ($50,000 at most) is outweighed by the guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John.  
* **Time Value and Risk:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob walking away or further lowering his offer, while John provides a certain outcome. You've already invested time in these negotiations, and John is offering a fair price.

**It's strategically advantageous at this point to accept John's offer and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000.**"
