Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be a great asset to you.  I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$15,000 is a good starting point:** It's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is positive and emphasizes value:** It focuses on the potential benefits for Bob rather than just the price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** I haven't set a hard limit, allowing for a possible compromise.

**Important Note:** This is a strategic starting point. Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy to maximize my profit."
