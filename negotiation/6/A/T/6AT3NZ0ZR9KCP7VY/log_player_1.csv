Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This gives me a good margin, but it's not too high that it would immediately scare Bob off.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but if not, I'll be ready to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $125 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get a better price. I'm going to try and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter with $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this shows that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm also not desperate to sell at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $130 is still a good deal. It's significantly more than I'd get from John, and further negotiation could risk Bob walking away completely."
