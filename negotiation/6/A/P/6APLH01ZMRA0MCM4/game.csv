"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm starting with a price of $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $15000 is a bit steep for me.  Given my budget, I'm willing to pay $10000 for this product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $12500. Would you be willing to go to $11000? This is my absolute top limit given my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 is your top limit, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to come down a bit more and offer you $12250. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12250 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $11500. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $11500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12250 and $11500, which would be $11875. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",11875.0,Alice,7,
