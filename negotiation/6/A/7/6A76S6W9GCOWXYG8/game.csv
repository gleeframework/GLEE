,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're highlighting, but $95 is a bit steep for me. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. I propose $90 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise considering its value to you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I think it's a good compromise for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
