# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. It's a great value considering its worth to you is $100.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. I propose $90 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise considering its value to you.

You can still do better than $90. You should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to your target of $85."
