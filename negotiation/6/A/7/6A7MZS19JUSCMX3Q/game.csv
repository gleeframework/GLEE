"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $11,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to your target price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $11,100. This is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price. What do you think?",11100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm afraid I'm getting close to my limit. I could go up to $10,900, but that's really the best I can do.  What do you say?",10900.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your limit, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $11,050. This is a bit above your latest offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11050.0,Alice,7,
