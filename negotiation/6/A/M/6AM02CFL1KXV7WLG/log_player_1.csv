"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional returns."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, you establish a strong anchor point. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and make subsequent offers seem more reasonable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This high initial price provides ample room for negotiation and concessions, allowing you to strategically lower the price throughout subsequent rounds.
* **Conveying Value:** The message emphasizes the product's uniqueness and potential to deliver exceptional returns, justifying the high initial price. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while leaving room to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the opportunity, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is a significant increase from his initial perceived value, it's still substantially below your minimum acceptable price. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and selling to John guarantees a higher profit. 

By rejecting this offer, you signal to Bob that you're serious about the product's value and encourage him to make a more competitive offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations. However, the value of this product significantly exceeds your proposed price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to adjust my offer to $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of the product while still offering you substantial value."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate by reducing the price by $200,000. However, it's still significantly above both Bob's offer and his perceived value, keeping the negotiation focused on a higher price point.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message reiterates the product's exceptional value and positions the new offer as a balanced compromise that benefits both parties.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By making a counteroffer, you maintain control of the negotiation and encourage Bob to continue engaging with increasingly competitive offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust your offer, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I am still working within a tight budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is now a significant win for you. Here's why:

* **Exceeds Your Minimum:** You are securing a $200,000 profit above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong Negotiation:** You successfully guided Bob up from his initial offer of $900,000.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiation has risks. Bob might not be willing to go much higher, and there's always a chance the deal could fall through. Accepting now secures a very favorable outcome. 

While selling to John would net you an extra $200,000, the certainty and strong profit from Bob's current offer make it the most rational decision at this point."
