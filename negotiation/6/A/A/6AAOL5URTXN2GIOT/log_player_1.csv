Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate but also makes the offer attractive.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you make a profit and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **It's close to your value:** This makes it more likely that Bob will accept or counteroffer within a range you find acceptable. 

By starting with this offer, you'll have a better understanding of Bob's willingness to pay and can adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. This aligns more closely with my valuation. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum:** You've stated your product is worth no less than $10,000 to you. Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss.
* **You have a better option:** John is willing to pay your minimum, guaranteeing you a profit. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, rejecting it allows you to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, you'll be able to send a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between your desired price and Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still allows me to make a profit and hopefully makes it attractive for you as well. Let's try to find a middle ground!"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is exactly halfway between your previous offer ($9,500) and Bob's offer ($8,000). This demonstrates your willingness to negotiate and find common ground. 
* **Still profitable:**  $9,000 is still above your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you don't lose money.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone can encourage Bob to continue the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

By offering $9,000, you are showing flexibility and creating a more favorable negotiation position. If Bob rejects again, you can consider making a slightly lower counteroffer, but always keep your minimum price in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I am still unable to meet at $9,000. I would like to stick to my original offer of $8,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints. I hope we can reach a satisfactory agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer remains unacceptable:** Despite your willingness to negotiate, Bob has not budged from his initial offer of $8,000, which is well below your minimum acceptable price.
* **John provides a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John for $10,000 ensures you achieve your desired outcome and don't risk losing money.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely:**  Bob has made it clear that he's unwilling to increase his offer significantly, indicating that continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield a favorable outcome.

**Conclusion:**

It's time to move on and secure a guaranteed profit by selling to John.  While you might have been able to squeeze a slightly higher price out of Bob, the risk of further negotiation failing and wasting time is not worth it."
