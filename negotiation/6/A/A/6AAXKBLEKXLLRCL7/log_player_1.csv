Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob. This helps gauge his interest and sets a collaborative tone for the negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm aware I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100. This gives me leverage in the negotiation, as I'm not desperate to sell below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is above my absolute minimum of $100.  There's room to negotiate further.
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting, I signal that I value the product higher and am willing to walk away if necessary.  This helps me understand how much Bob is truly willing to pay. 
* **John as Leverage:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me the confidence to push for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110.  This product is truly worth it, and I believe you'll see the value in it."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a counteroffer, but not meeting Bob in the middle. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not desperate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to reinforce its worth in Bob's mind and justify the higher price.
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:** The new price of $110 keeps me comfortably above my minimum and allows for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $110, which would be $100. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 matches my minimum acceptable price and John's offer. 
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead Bob to walk away, leaving me with John's offer, which is the same. 
* **Time Value:**  Accepting now saves time and effort spent on further negotiation."
