,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $850,000.  This is a fair price, given the value I see in the product and my financial constraints. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to me is at least $1,000,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident this product has value, but I can only go up to $900,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're willing to make a significant investment in this product, Bob. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to me is still at least $1,000,000.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer you $925,000, which I believe is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's come to an agreement on this final offer.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're committed to this deal. However, I still need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but I'm not budging any further. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",975000.0,Alice,7,
