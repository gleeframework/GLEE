Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think will be really valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob knows he can get it for less than $12,000, and you can still go up if needed. 
* **It's a strong opening offer:** You're showing confidence in your product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to sell it. However, I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it doesn't leave any room for profit. By rejecting the offer, you can attempt to negotiate a higher price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  This allows you to stay within your budget while also giving me a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still feel that $9,000 might be a bit high for my current budget. Could we perhaps aim for $8,500? This would allow me to stay within my financial constraints while acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise. It's higher than your minimum of $8,000 and allows you to make a profit while still keeping Bob happy. It's unlikely that you'll be able to negotiate a higher price, and the risk of further negotiation could lead to Bob walking away entirely."
