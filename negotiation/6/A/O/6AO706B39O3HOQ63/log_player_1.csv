Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** My message is friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the product and encouraging Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value of $15,000 as possible. However, I'm also prepared to accept a lower price if it means securing a sale. By starting with a higher offer and being willing to negotiate, I can potentially extract a better price from Bob.

I'm also keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $15,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall through. This gives me leverage during the negotiation and ensures I can still achieve my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can secure it for a lower price elsewhere. I am willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm not yet willing to accept it.  Here's why:

* **Negotiation:**  I want to see if I can push Bob further.  He's already indicated he values the product, and there's still room for him to increase his offer.
* **Potential for higher price:** If I accept Bob's offer, I'm leaving $2,000 on the table compared to selling to John. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value, aiming to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $13,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500 for this amazing product. It's a fair price that reflects the value it offers. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $13,500, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining my goal of getting a higher price.
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's perspective and reiterate the value of the product. The message remains positive and encourages further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By offering a slightly lower price, I aim to:

* **Increase the chances of acceptance:** Bob might be more willing to pay $13,500 than $14,000.
* **Show flexibility:** Demonstrating willingness to compromise can make Bob feel more comfortable proceeding.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm still holding out for a price closer to my ideal value and haven't entirely given in.

I'm still prepared to accept Bob's offer or sell to John if necessary, but I believe this counteroffer gives me the best chance of getting a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I've been able to locate an alternative source offering the product at $13,000. I believe this aligns more closely with what I'm looking to spend. I would like to make a counteroffer of $12,500 for your product. This is the highest amount I'm comfortable paying given my budget constraints. Please let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is below my minimum value of $15,000. While I could continue negotiating, it's becoming increasingly clear that I'm unlikely to reach a price that meets my needs.

**Reasons for selling to John:**

* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit of $15,000. 
* **Time & Energy:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could be time-consuming and might not yield a better outcome.
* **Potential for lower offers:** There's a risk that Bob will continue to lower his offers, making it even harder to secure a profitable deal.

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer to sell to Bob, it's more beneficial to secure the sale with John, guaranteeing a comfortable profit and minimizing the risk of a lower offer."
