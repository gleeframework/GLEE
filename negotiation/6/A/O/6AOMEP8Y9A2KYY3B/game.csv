"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  while I appreciate the offer, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for this product. This is a fair price considering your own value for it and my maximum budget. Let me know your thoughts.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering its value to me is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? This is a good compromise for both of us, and would allow me to purchase the product within my budget. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to be flexible. Considering your willingness to meet me halfway, I'll take it to $9,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
