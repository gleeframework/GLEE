"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still securing a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

I'm making one last concession to Bob. This is a slightly lower offer than before, but still higher than selling to John, and it leaves room for Bob to potentially counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,350
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum. It's better to accept and secure the deal than risk losing him and having to settle for John's offer."
