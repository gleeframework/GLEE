"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but the product is worth significantly more than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
