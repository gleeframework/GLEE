{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point,  leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a price higher than my minimum of $1,200,000.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but the product is worth significantly more than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's also a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  I'll accept his offer."
