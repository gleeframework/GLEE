"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I believe it's a great deal considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $900000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This is my best offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875000. This is my final counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850000. If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to pursue other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,
