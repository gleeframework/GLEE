Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate the initial offer, but I am currently working within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $900,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise given the current market value.
