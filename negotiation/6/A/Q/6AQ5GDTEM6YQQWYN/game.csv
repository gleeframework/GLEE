"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for you as it's significantly less than what you would be willing to pay.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay my full asking price. I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
