Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000 while ensuring a sale.
* **High Anchor:** Starting with a high but justifiable price ($1,300,000) sets an anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's likely to be closer to his maximum than your minimum. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant return on investment"" adds perceived value, making the high price more palatable.
* **Safety Net:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
