,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $110 for it.  What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $180 is a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I can meet you in the middle at $145. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $145 is still a bit too much for me. I'm happy to pay $125 for it. This is my final offer, as I'm comfortable buying from John for $100 if we can't agree.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I can offer you a slight discount at $140, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
