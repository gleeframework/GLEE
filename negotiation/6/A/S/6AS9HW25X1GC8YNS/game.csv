"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get us started: $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $1,100,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,100,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still hoping to get it down a little further.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,050,000.  I'm confident this will be a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,080,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,050,000, and I think this price reflects the product's true value. Let's see if we can shake on it at this price.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
