"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm really interested, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000, which is my maximum. What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $12000. It's my max, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $12000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $14000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still holding firm at $12000.  If we can't agree on that, I'm afraid I'll have to go with another seller.  ",12000.0,Bob,6,
