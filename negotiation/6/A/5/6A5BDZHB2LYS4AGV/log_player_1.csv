"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my profit.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate.  I'll keep John in mind as a backup option if the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. $850,000 is closer to my goal, but I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I still have 8 rounds to work with, so I'm not in a rush to accept yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $875,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer.  It's still a good deal for me, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still have time to negotiate and potentially get a higher price. I'll see if I can push him a little further before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $850,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.  I believe this is a fair price considering we are both getting closer to the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  I'm still hoping to get closer to $850,000.  I'm not in a rush to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better deal with Bob.  With only 4 rounds left, I need to start thinking about my options carefully, but I'm still optimistic about reaching a good price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 835000}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm making a final push for a price closer to my goal. I'm offering $835,000, which is just a bit higher than Bob's last offer.  I hope this will be enough to convince him to accept, but if not, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  With only two rounds left, the negotiation with Bob has stalled.  While I was hoping to get a higher price, selling to John guarantees me a decent profit and avoids the risk of Bob rejecting my final offer. It's better to take a secure deal than risk ending up with nothing."
