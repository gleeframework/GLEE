Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals and constraints:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefit you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:**  Alice has a guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 from John. Offering the product for a price higher than Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) would risk losing the sale. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just one possible approach.  Alice could choose to start higher or lower depending on her risk tolerance and negotiation style. 
* The message is crafted to be polite, professional, and highlight the value proposition for Bob."
