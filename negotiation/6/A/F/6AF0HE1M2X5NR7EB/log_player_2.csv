Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a good start, it's a bit too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow us to finalize the deal. What do you say?

However, I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, and I'm also considering buying from John. I'll make a counteroffer, but if Alice rejects it, I might consider buying from John.
