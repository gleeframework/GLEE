"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a good start, it's a bit too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay that much. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow us to finalize the deal. What do you say?",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $10,500, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my budget.",10500.0,Bob,6,
