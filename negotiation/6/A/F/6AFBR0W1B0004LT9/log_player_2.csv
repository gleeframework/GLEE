"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can still save money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  He has room to negotiate since he's willing to pay up to $10,000 and Alice is willing to sell for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  Offering $9,000 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. This leaves a potential $1,000 in savings for Bob compared to Alice's offer, and still gives Alice a profit of $1,000 over her minimum selling price."
