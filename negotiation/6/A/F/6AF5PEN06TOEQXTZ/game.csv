"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1200000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value I'm seeking.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1300000. This is a fair compromise considering the value I'm looking to get out of the deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're aiming for a higher price, but $1300000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to consider. If you're still interested, I'm open to discussing further. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
