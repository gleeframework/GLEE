Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum ($10,000) but still leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel he's getting a good deal.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and focuses on the value the product holds for Bob.  

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming for a compromise. By offering a price above my minimum, I show flexibility and encourage Bob to engage in a negotiation. However, by not starting too low, I ensure that I don't leave money on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to save as much as I can. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Selling to John for $10,000 is also not appealing as I can potentially get a better price from Bob.

**Reasoning:**

I'm willing to continue the negotiation with Bob. Even though his offer is currently below my minimum, I'm hopeful that I can secure a higher price through counteroffers.  Selling to John now would mean accepting a lower price than what I might get from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a fair price considering the value this product holds for you.  I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to sell for a price that's too low.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating the value of the product for Bob, but also emphasizing that I'm willing to be flexible and reach a fair deal.

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to find a price that's acceptable to both of us. By meeting Bob halfway, I'm hoping to encourage him to accept the offer. It's a risky strategy, but I'm confident that I can still get a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $11,500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is still below my desired price, but it's now above my minimum. Selling to John would net me $10,000, so accepting Bob's offer is the best option as it's a higher price.

**Reasoning:**

I've already made several concessions, and I'm not sure I can get a higher price through further negotiation. At this point, it's better to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale, even if it's not my ideal price."
