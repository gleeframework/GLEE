Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8000. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $8,000 is my minimum, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing my commitment to finding a solution.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $8,750 is closer to my ideal price, I still think I can get a little more. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still above Bob's."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go down to $9,250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think we're both getting closer. Let's compromise on $9000. It's a fair price considering where we've both landed. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $9,000 is a good price, and I'm happy to close the deal.  It's important to remember that every round we negotiate, the risk of selling to John increases, so it's wise to accept a good offer when it comes along."
