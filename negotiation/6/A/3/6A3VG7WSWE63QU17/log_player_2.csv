"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. It's an exceptional value considering its worth to you is $100. Don't miss out on this opportunity to secure a high-quality item at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $95 is less than your maximum budget of $100, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice at a lower price, getting you closer to your goal of saving money."
