{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the potential benefits of the product for Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've successfully sold the product.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worth negotiating further. I'll also keep in mind the $15,000 offer from John, which is my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation for the product. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is $1,500 less than my desired price of $14,000 and only $500 more than his estimated value of $12,000.  This is a very low offer. 
* **John's Offer:**  John is willing to pay $15,000, which is significantly more than Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price. While I would like to earn more, I'm willing to consider a lower price if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between his offer and my initial offer. I'll explain that I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a higher price to make the sale worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand you want to get a great deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  This would be a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,500. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone and emphasizing the benefits of reaching a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is a good price for both of us, highlighting the value of the product. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a decent price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll re-evaluate my options and consider if a further counteroffer is warranted or if I should accept John's offer of $15,000."
