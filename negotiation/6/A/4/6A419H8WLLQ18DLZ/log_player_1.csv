Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if needed, but also aims to secure a higher profit if Bob accepts immediately.
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason for the price (""fair price considering its value"") makes the offer seem more reasonable and less arbitrary.
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts, you get a great deal. If he counters, you can negotiate knowing you have John's offer as a safety net."
