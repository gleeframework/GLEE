"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $8750? I'm really interested in this product, so hopefully we can find a price that works for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not quite ready to give up on the $9500 just yet. How about we meet in the middle again, but this time at $9000? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Okay, Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your guns on the $8750. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I'm not willing to give up on the value of this product entirely. How about we meet in the middle again, but this time at $8900? It's a bit closer to your offer, and I think it's still a fair price for this incredible product.",8900.0,Alice,5,
