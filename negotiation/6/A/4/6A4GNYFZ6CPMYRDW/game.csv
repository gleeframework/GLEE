"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $14,000. I think it could really be valuable for you, and this is a competitive price.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know if you're open to that.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $10,000 is really pushing my bottom line.  I can go down to $10,750, and that's my final offer. It's a great deal for you.",10750.0,Alice,5,
