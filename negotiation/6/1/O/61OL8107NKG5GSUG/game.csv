"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe you'll find it to be a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $14,000 for the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $14,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to go up to $13,000, but that's my absolute maximum. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $14,500 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",14500.0,Alice,5,
