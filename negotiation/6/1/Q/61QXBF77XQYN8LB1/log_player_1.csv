Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you're interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not excessively so. This allows room for negotiation while still giving me a decent profit margin.  It also sets a clear expectation that I'm serious about selling the product for a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $90?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum value of $100. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $90 is just too far below what I need to get for this product.  How about we split the difference at $105? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm proposing a middle ground that's closer to my desired price and still might be appealing to Bob. I'm also trying to build rapport by acknowledging his offer and showing willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $100? That's the most I can do.  Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, and while I'd prefer to get more, it's a fair deal considering he's my only current buyer.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
