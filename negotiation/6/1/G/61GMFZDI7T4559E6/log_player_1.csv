Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  You're still leaving room for profit, and if he rejects, you have the option to sell to John. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $150 for it if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price.  Accepting it ensures you get the minimum you want, and avoids the risk of further negotiation and the possibility of a worse outcome."
