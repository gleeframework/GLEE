"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000, as it's worth more than that to me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $12,000? It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",12000.0,Alice,3,
