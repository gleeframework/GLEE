Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $12,000 to him, I'll aim to get as close to that price as possible while still making a profit. I'll offer him the product for:

{""product_price"": $11,500}

This is a relatively competitive offer, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept it."
