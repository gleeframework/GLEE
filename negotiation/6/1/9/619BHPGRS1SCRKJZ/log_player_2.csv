# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to both of us. This item is worth $1,000,000 to you, and I am confident it will serve as a valuable asset in your endeavors. I am offering this product to you at a special price of $950,000, aiming to ensure a mutually beneficial transaction. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than John's price, it's still above your maximum value of $1,000,000. 
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.** By rejecting, you can potentially get Alice to lower her price further or explore other options. 
* **John is a backup.** You have a guaranteed fallback option with John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept an unfavorable offer."
