"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000. This is my best and final offer.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000 either. I can meet you in the middle at $14,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $14,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,000. I can offer you a slight discount to $14,000, which is a compromise I'm willing to make. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
