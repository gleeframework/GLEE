Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a discounted price of $14,000. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to start too low. This offer is closer to our minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Offering a price of $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate. He might counter-offer, and we can always slightly lower the price to entice him. 
* **Backup Plan:**  We have a guaranteed offer from John at $15,000, so we're not pressured to accept anything below our minimum.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a seemingly attractive deal."
