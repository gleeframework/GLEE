"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $120. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $80 to you. Alice's offer of $120 is too high.  You should reject the offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $110 is still too high for you. You can get the product for $80 from John. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice, as you're unlikely to get a better price from her."
