"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is far beyond my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $800000 for it. This is the maximum I can pay, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering its value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1100000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's worth. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $800000. This is the absolute maximum I'm able to spend on this product.  I believe it's a fair price for both of us and hope you'll reconsider.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $800000, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm offering you a price of $900000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a good value for the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
