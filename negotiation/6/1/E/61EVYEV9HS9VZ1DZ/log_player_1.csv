Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Considering the value you mentioned, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than my absolute minimum ($1,500,000), it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a better price."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting progressively lower and is now below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that I'll continue to lose ground. Selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures I achieve my minimum goal and avoids further risk of losing value."
