Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This price is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and still leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be willing to pay this price as it is less than the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is lower than I would like, but it is still above my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and counter with a higher price.  I believe we can still reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still higher than his offer and closer to the value I place on the product. I believe Bob will be willing to pay this price, as it is significantly lower than the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already been through multiple rounds of negotiation.  It's clear that Bob is not willing to pay closer to the value I place on the product.  Therefore, I will accept the offer from John and sell the product for $8,000."
