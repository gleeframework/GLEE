"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your position, the product's value is substantial, and I can't accept such a significant reduction. How about we meet in the middle at $1,180,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's worth.",1180000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working towards a compromise, Alice.  How about we settle at $1,080,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to my business.",1080000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $1,080,000 is close, but to make this work on my end, I need to propose a final price of $1,130,000.  I believe that's a fair and final offer that reflects the product's value.",1130000.0,Alice,5,
