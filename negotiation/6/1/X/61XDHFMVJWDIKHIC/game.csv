"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7,000 is quite a bit lower than what I need to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $7,000 is a significant drop, Alice. How about we meet closer to the middle at $7,500? ",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we compromise at $8,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us move forward with this deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
