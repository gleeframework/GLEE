"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and open tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to me, implying it's worth more than what I'm offering. 

This strategy aims to set the initial bar high while leaving room for negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **I have time for negotiation.** I'm still in the early rounds, and there's potential to get a better price. 
* **Selling to John is always an option.** I can always choose to sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7,000 is quite a bit lower than what I need to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that $8,250 is still a good deal for him, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Staying Firm:**  I'm still not going below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but I'm showing flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $7,000 is a significant drop, Alice. How about we meet closer to the middle at $7,500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than the previous one, it's still significantly below my desired price and my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have several rounds left, and John is a safe fallback option. 
* **Room for improvement:** I believe I can still push for a better deal, potentially by offering a slight counter-offer.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly higher price, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we compromise at $8,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us move forward with this deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's right in the middle between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  I'm framing $8,000 as a ""fair"" price for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Moving Forward:**  I'm suggesting we ""move forward"" with the deal, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging a positive response."
