Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

While $875,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob.  We're so close to a deal, I'm confident I can push for a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $890000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $880000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm getting close to my maximum, so I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer of $880,000 is a good deal. It's significantly higher than selling to John, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer secures a strong profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away entirely."
