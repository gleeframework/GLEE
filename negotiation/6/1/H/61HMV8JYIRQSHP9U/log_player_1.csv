Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to try to see if I can get a little closer to my target price of $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to $90.  Would you be willing to go up to $88?"", ""product_price"": 88}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $88, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $82? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $82 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still going to try to get a bit more. I'm not sure how much more Bob is willing to pay, but I'm willing to continue negotiating for a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $82 just isn't quite there for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  I think that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target. How about $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting really close to my minimum, but I don't want to risk Bob rejecting my next offer and then being stuck with nothing. I'm going to sell to John for $80. It's not my ideal price, but it's still better than nothing."
