{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit significantly higher than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. It also acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product while maintaining a position of strength."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $800,000.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, it's important to keep negotiating. His offer indicates he's interested in the product, and there's room for us to find a middle ground. Selling to John would guarantee a profit, but I might be able to achieve a higher price through further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This reflects the value of the product to you and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
