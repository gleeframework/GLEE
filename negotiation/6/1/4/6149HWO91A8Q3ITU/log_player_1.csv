"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $80 is far too low, and I can easily get $150 from John.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to let him take advantage of me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply not enough. How about we split the difference? I'll let you have it for $125.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $125 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $95 is closer to what I'd like, I'm still not willing to sell it for less than $100. I'm confident I can get a better deal from Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic here. I've come down from my initial price, and you've only gone up a few dollars.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? This is a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100. It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can close this deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is tempting, I'm going to hold out for a little longer.  I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating with Bob or can get a better price from John.  I'm also not keen on letting Bob know how low I'm willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. $100 is a good offer.  Let's split the difference,  I'll take $105 for it. That's a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to a close.  How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm very close to my limit, but I can offer $102. If you want to close this deal, I think we should meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John for $150.  While Bob is getting closer, I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk getting a lower price. John's offer is guaranteed and significantly better than what Bob is offering."
