Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're working with a tight budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. Considering its true value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it's still a great deal. Let me know what you think!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Alice is clearly holding firm on her price, and while we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll get a price much lower than $1,050,000. Accepting this offer saves us $450,000 compared to John's price."
