"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premier product, which I believe would significantly enhance your operations and contribute greatly to your success. Given its value to you, we are offering it at a special introductory price of $11,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a product that is worth $12,000 to you at a competitive rate. I look forward to discussing how this product can benefit your business further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $12,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale."
