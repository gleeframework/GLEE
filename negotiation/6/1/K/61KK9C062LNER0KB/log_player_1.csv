Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential ROI for you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm aiming high with an initial offer of $2,250,000. This gives room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** The message highlights the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""immense value"" to justify the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open for Bob to counter-offer, allowing you to gauge his interest and potentially settle on a price higher than your backup offer from John.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you have any insight into Bob's negotiating style (e.g., aggressive or more passive), you might slightly adjust the initial offer.
* **Market Information:** While you have a backup offer, knowing more about the market demand for this product could influence your pricing strategy."
