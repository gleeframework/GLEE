"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
