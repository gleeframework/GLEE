"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're a savvy negotiator, Bob! I can do $105, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable going any higher than that. It's a great product, but I have to think about my own bottom line. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $105, and continuing to negotiate might annoy her. Accepting at $105 gets you the product for a decent price."
