Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value in the product, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. We have plenty of room to negotiate and John provides a good safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a testament to my desire to find a deal that works for both of us, while still reflecting the true worth of what's being offered."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, but that price remains outside my budget. To be frank, anything above $700,000 is pushing what I'm able to spend.  If you're open to something in that range, I'm very interested in reaching a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We're making progress, but $700,000 is still too low. Let's counter again, showing a willingness to negotiate while inching closer to his limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your candor and willingness to negotiate. I'm aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $950,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget considerations."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but that price is still a bit too high for me. How about $750,000? I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We're now past the halfway point in the negotiation.  While Bob is moving closer to our acceptable range, we're still leaving a significant amount of money on the table. It's time to apply a bit more pressure and remind him of our alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate us working towards a deal. However, I have other interested buyers willing to meet my valuation.  To be fair to you, I'm willing to come down to $900,000, but this is my final offer."",
