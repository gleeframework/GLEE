"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value in the product, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a testament to my desire to find a deal that works for both of us, while still reflecting the true worth of what's being offered.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, but that price remains outside my budget. To be frank, anything above $700,000 is pushing what I'm able to spend.  If you're open to something in that range, I'm very interested in reaching a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your candor and willingness to negotiate. I'm aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $950,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but that price is still a bit too high for me. How about $750,000? I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate us working towards a deal. However, I have other interested buyers willing to meet my valuation.  To be fair to you, I'm willing to come down to $900,000, but this is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,7,
