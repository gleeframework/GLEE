"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9800 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",9800.0,Bob,4,
