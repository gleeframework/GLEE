"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm sure you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $8,000 to Bob. Alice's offer of $12,000 is too high. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $12,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the maximum I can afford right now. Let me know if this is a price you'd consider."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can offer you a compromise at $11000. This is a great deal, considering the value this product can bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's budget. It's better to reject the offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I can't go higher than $9,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still a bit constrained by your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I can offer you a slight concession at $10500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still too high for Bob. He can always get the product from John for $8,000, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $10,500 is still beyond my budget. My absolute maximum is $9,500.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your transparency, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I can offer you a final compromise at $10200. This is a significant concession from my previous offers, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While she's come down in price, it's clear that she's not willing to meet Bob's needs.  It's better for Bob to buy the product from John at $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
