"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than $10,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product looks great, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $9000 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8800. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price to $8,800, which is within Bob's budget of $10,000.
* Bob's goal is to save money, and this offer represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.
* While further negotiation is possible, there's a risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and leaving Bob with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price."
