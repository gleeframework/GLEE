{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate while still leaving me with a profit.  I've also added a positive message to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $175 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price ($150).  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate you making an offer, but $125 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $160?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $135.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm still hopeful of getting a better price, Bob's offer of $135 is below my minimum threshold of $150. Selling to John at $150 ensures I meet my minimum target and avoid potentially losing more time with Bob."
