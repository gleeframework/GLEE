"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice is asking for $1,000,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** You can always purchase from John if the negotiation with Alice fails, but you want to save money if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000. Let me know if that's something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is reasonable.** She met you halfway, and $950,000 is a significant saving compared to her initial price and your maximum budget.
* **Buying from John is more expensive.** You can get a better price from Alice, so there's no need to go with John at this point.
* **The negotiation has progressed.**  Alice is willing to compromise, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price. 

While you could try to negotiate further, accepting the offer now minimizes risk and secures a good deal."
