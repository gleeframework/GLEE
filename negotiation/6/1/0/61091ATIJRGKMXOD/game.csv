"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000. Let me know if that's something we can work with.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000.
