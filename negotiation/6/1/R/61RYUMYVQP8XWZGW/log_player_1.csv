Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $8500 right now. Let me know if you're willing to work with me on this price.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value for the product ($10,000).  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by counter-offering in the next round."
