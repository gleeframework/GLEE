"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $105? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to give up on my original price just yet. How about we try $102? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **You're getting a good deal:** $102 is significantly less than your $120 fallback option with John.
* **Negotiations are stalling:** Alice is moving in smaller increments, suggesting she's less likely to drop much further. 
* **Time is a factor:**  The longer you negotiate, the greater the risk of losing the deal entirely if Alice decides to walk away."
