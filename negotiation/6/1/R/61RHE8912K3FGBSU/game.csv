"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm happy to negotiate.  While I acknowledge the value to you,  $900,000 falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to commit to purchasing it. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",950000.0,Bob,4,
