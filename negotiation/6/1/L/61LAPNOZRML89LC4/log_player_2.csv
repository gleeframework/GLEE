"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and the benefits it offers, I believe a starting price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's a good starting point to negotiate, but there's a lot of room for improvement.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and hopefully reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $22,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product. This is the highest I can go at this time, given its value to me."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $19,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and reach a more reasonable price. I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $19,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm prepared to offer $12,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us. "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're getting closer.  While $12,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept that price, but only if you can finalize the purchase within the next 24 hours. This offer demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000. While she's willing to accept a lower price, I'm not comfortable with the pressure of a 24-hour deadline.  Buying from John at $8,000 guarantees the product within my budget and allows me to avoid any potential stress or complications."
