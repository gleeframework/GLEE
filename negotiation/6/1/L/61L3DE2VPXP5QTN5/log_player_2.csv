"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm Alice. I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is far too high. You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so it makes sense to negotiate down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay something closer to $800,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price and even below my maximum budget. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that her initial offer is unrealistic.
* **Leaving Room for Movement:** While I'm starting low, I'm not going ridiculously low. This suggests I'm serious but looking for a fair deal.
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help me understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. If she's completely unwilling to budge from her initial offer, I know I can always go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $2,300,000 represents the high value I place on this product, I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  Would you consider $1,850,000? I believe this offer reflects a more balanced approach. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down a bit, but her offer is still much higher than your alternative with John.  You need to signal that you're serious about a lower price point and that she needs to move further to keep you engaged."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but that's still quite a gap from what I had in mind.  To be honest, I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000 for this product.  If you're able to work within that range, I'm very interested.  Otherwise, I may need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Clear:** I'm being very upfront about my budget and what I'm willing to pay. This avoids unnecessary back-and-forth.
* **Mentioning Alternatives:** By mentioning ""other options"" (i.e., John), I'm reminding Alice that I have a viable alternative if we can't agree. This strengthens my negotiating position.
* **Final Offer (Almost):** While I'm phrasing it as a range, I'm signaling that $1,000,000 is likely my limit. I'm willing to walk away if she can't meet it."
