"Hello Bob, I'm Alice. I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay something closer to $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $2,300,000 represents the high value I place on this product, I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  Would you consider $1,850,000? I believe this offer reflects a more balanced approach.",1850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but that's still quite a gap from what I had in mind.  To be honest, I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000 for this product.  If you're able to work within that range, I'm very interested.  Otherwise, I may need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
