"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum price of $150.  I'm confident I can get a better price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $140, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, and I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $135 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push Bob a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to be flexible.  But $135 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $138, which is closer to your offer and still within my acceptable range. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 138}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $138 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $135 and $138, which would be $136.50. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $136.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $136.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $136.50 is getting closer to my minimum price, I still have a few rounds left and I'm not feeling pressured to close the deal just yet. I think I can get a little bit more with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to be fair. $136.50 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $137? I believe that's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 137}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit uncomfortable with $137. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $135 and $137, which would be $136. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $136. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $136
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. While it's not my ideal price, I've only got two rounds left. It's unlikely I'll get a better offer from Bob, and selling to John for $150 would be better, but I'm close to my desired price and want to avoid the hassle of dealing with another buyer."
