"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that makes sense for both of us.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer, let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the value this product brings. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's split the difference and go with $925,000. This is a good price for both of us, and allows us to move forward with the deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,000,000. To show I'm serious about making this work, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is my final offer.",975000.0,Alice,5,
