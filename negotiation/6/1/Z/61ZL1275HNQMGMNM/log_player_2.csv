"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to our $12,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product looks great, but $14,000 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  A large counteroffer helps us understand how willing Alice is to negotiate. 
* **Establish room for negotiation:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, it gives us space to gradually increase our offer over the remaining rounds. 
* **Aim for the best possible deal:**  While $10,000 is low, there's always a chance Alice might accept it, saving us a significant amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice moved closer to our desired price, but we're still above our $12,000 target. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate and can try to get closer to our ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. How about we settle at $11,000? That would be a comfortable price for me."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** We're moving closer to Alice's price in smaller increments to show our interest while still negotiating. 
* **Aiming within budget:** $11,000 keeps us within our target range and leaves a little room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Maintaining a collaborative tone:**  We're continuing to express our appreciation for Alice's flexibility to encourage a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our target price! There's no point in negotiating further or buying from John, as we've achieved the best possible outcome in this scenario."
