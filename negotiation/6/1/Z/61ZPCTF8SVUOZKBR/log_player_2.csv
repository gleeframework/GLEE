"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling this product, and I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm initially offering it for $15,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It makes more sense to counteroffer or buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget, $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you meet me halfway at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still above his desired price point.  Bob should reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
