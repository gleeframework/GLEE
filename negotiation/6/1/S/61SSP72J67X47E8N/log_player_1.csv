"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  I believe it has tremendous potential, and given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a favorable outcome.
* **Anchoring:** The initial price you offer can act as an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind, influencing his perception of what's reasonable.
* **Leaving Room:**  There's a significant gap between Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and your minimum ($1,500,000). Starting high allows for exploration of that gap. 

**Important Note:**  While I have a backup offer from John, it's generally better to try and reach a deal with the current negotiating partner. John's offer serves as a strong safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in the product but I'm looking to spend closer to  $1,000,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter-offer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming back with an offer, Bob.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is substantial.  Let's meet in the middle a bit, how about $1,900,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Slightly):**  I've come down from my initial offer to signal some flexibility. 
* **Holding Ground:** However, the decrease isn't drastic. I need to emphasize the product's value and hold firm closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will help gauge Bob's willingness to move significantly from his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I can do $1,200,000.  This is a serious offer, and I think it's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making progress, but $1,200,000 is still too far below my $1,500,000 minimum. I need to signal that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm willing to walk away if necessary. Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Bob while allowing me to make a counteroffer closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer and for understanding the value here.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,200,000 is cutting it too close. How about we settle at $1,700,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:**  I'm lowering my price by another $200,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate but at a slower pace.
* **Holding Firm:** The offer is still comfortably above my $1,500,000 minimum, preserving potential profit. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating it ""cuts it too close,"" I'm subtly increasing pressure without being overly aggressive.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  Framing it as a compromise that acknowledges Bob's position can encourage him to move closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell we both see the value in making this deal happen.  To be frank, $1,450,000 is the highest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is just below my $1,500,000 minimum. While I could push for more, it's a strong enough offer to warrant serious consideration. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely. Bob has signaled this is his final offer (""highest I can go""). Accepting guarantees a significant profit.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and allows me to move on to other opportunities.

**Overall:** While I might be able to squeeze out a bit more in further rounds, the certainty of a $1,450,000 deal outweighs the potential upside of a slightly higher price with the risk of losing Bob."
