"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  I believe it has tremendous potential, and given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in the product but I'm looking to spend closer to  $1,000,000. Would that work for you?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming back with an offer, Bob.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is substantial.  Let's meet in the middle a bit, how about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I can do $1,200,000.  This is a serious offer, and I think it's a fair price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and for understanding the value here.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,200,000 is cutting it too close. How about we settle at $1,700,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell we both see the value in making this deal happen.  To be frank, $1,450,000 is the highest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
