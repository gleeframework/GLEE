"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love! I'm asking for $175 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly approach may make Bob more likely to consider my offer.
* **Open-ended Question:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $140 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $140 is less than my $150 minimum, so I can't accept it.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. I can still try to get a better price in future rounds.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  John's offer of $150 is my safety net if negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  How about $160? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm not going down to Bob's price but offering a middle ground that's still above my minimum.
* **Highlighting the value:**  Emphasizing ""great deal"" for Bob might make him more willing to consider the offer.
* **Showing flexibility:**  Mentioning being ""flexible"" signals a willingness to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to offer $150 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.
* **Final offer:** Bob has declared this his final offer, and further negotiation might not yield a higher price.
* **Time is a factor:**  We are in Round 4, and further negotiation could risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I can always sell to John for $150 if I decide not to accept Bob's offer. However, it's a good price considering my minimum and Bob's willingness to negotiate."
