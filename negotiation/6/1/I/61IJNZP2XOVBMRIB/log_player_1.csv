Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John.  I'm getting impatient with Bob's refusal to budge much.  I've only got 2 more rounds to get a better price, and it doesn't look like he's going to come up much.  John is guaranteed to give me my minimum desired price."
