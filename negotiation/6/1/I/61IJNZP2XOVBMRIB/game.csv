"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8800 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9250, which is a significant compromise on my end. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8500 again, but I'm willing to throw in an additional $200 in extras to sweeten the deal. Would you be willing to accept $8700?",8700.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with the extra $200, but $8700 is still not close enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize this deal.",9000.0,Alice,7,
