"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal than $1,000,000.  The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, meaning there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best price possible, but also wants to avoid losing the deal.  A counteroffer of $900,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation if Alice is unwilling to accept.  This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but is also prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $950,000 is less than Bob's maximum of $1,200,000.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it:**  Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, and further negotiation could risk losing the deal entirely.  The potential savings from a lower counteroffer might not be worth the risk of Alice walking away.
* **Time is a factor:** While Bob doesn't explicitly state a time constraint, continuing to negotiate might delay the purchase unnecessarily. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $950,000 is the most sensible option. It's a good deal for Bob while still being a profitable sale for Alice."
