"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However,  $1,600,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is my final offer.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,400,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000? This is a fair offer, as I have another seller offering the same product for this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
