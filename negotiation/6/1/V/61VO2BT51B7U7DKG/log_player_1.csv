Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However,  $1,600,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $800,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,400,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000? This is a fair offer, as I have another seller offering the same product for this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unwilling to budge past his valuation of $1,000,000.  Since I can sell the product to John for $1,200,000, it makes the most financial sense to proceed with John."
