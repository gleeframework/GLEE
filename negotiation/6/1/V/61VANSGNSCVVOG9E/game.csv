"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,200,000 is tempting, it doesn't quite reflect the product's full value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, reflecting a fair compromise.  This price allows you to secure a valuable asset at a price that's still beneficial to me. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
