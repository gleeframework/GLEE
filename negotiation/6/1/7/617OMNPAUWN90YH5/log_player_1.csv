Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to give in just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm countering with $18,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping to get closer to $18,000, $16,000 is still a good price. It's above my minimum, and it seems like Bob is firm on his position. I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
