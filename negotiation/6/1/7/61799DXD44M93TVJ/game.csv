"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its worth to me. Would you be willing to consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,050,000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. This is the highest I can go, but I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to compromise.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and it's getting closer to where I need to be. However,  $1,025,000  is still a bit too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,037,500?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can finalize the sale. Let me know your thoughts.",1037500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that we're close, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,037,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
