"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $115? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  $115 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested!",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $120.  This would allow us both to close the deal and I'd be very happy to have the product.",120.0,Bob,4,
