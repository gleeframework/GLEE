"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. My initial price is $1,400,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product looks great, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and gives us both a good deal.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our ongoing negotiation, $1,200,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000.  This price is fair, reflecting both the product's value and my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I need to ensure this transaction is profitable for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer the product for $1,275,000. This price reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business while still allowing me a decent profit. Let's close this deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
