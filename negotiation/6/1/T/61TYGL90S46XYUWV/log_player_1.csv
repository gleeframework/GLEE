"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum price of $8,000.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he's not, I can adjust my price in the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer than my initial price. I'm hoping this will be a compromise that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum, but I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  There's no guarantee that Bob will accept any further counteroffers, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price."
