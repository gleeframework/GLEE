Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA)"":**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 would theoretically benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still making the offer attractive enough that Bob won't refuse.  Since you have a guaranteed backup offer, you can be a bit bolder.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  The message emphasizes exclusivity and value.
* **Ambitious Price:**  $1,150,000 leaves you room to negotiate down slightly if needed while still securing a significant profit.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning other interested parties (even if John is your only other option) creates urgency.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. You could adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance."
