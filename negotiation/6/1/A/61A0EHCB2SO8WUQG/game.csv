"Alice, your product is a bit too expensive for me at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $600,000 is far below what I need to sell. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $700,000. Would you be open to that?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $750,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial price. This price is still fair given the value of the product. If you're serious about making this deal, this is my final offer.",750000.0,Alice,5,
