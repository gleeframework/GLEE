Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  This price gives Bob a reason to counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price within a reasonable range.
* **Protecting my minimum:**  This offer is well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, allowing me to potentially sell to John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is a bit too expensive for me at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would be a huge loss for me.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it demonstrates his interest in the product. I can use this to my advantage in the next round. 
* **John is a safety net:** I can still sell to John for a much higher price, providing a strong backup plan if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $600,000 is far below what I need to sell. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards Bob's price:**  I'm reducing my price from $1,000,000 to $850,000, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $850,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, ensuring I don't lose too much money.
* **Creating urgency:** By offering a compromise, I'm suggesting that this is a final offer, potentially pushing Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $700,000. Would you be open to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Room for negotiation:** Although Bob's offers are getting closer, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **John's offer is tempting:**  John's offer is significantly higher, providing a strong incentive to keep negotiating with Bob. If we can't reach a better deal, selling to John is the safer option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $750,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial price. This price is still fair given the value of the product. If you're serious about making this deal, this is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** By calling this my ""final offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency, hoping to push Bob towards accepting.
* **Moving closer to Bob's price:**  I'm further reducing my price from $850,000 to $750,000, showing flexibility.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $750,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Evaluating the situation:** I'm assessing Bob's willingness to pay. If he rejects this offer, I may be better off selling to John."
