"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

We are starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still above her valuation of the product. This strategy aims to leave room for negotiation while trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we can still negotiate. We are aiming for a price closer to $120. Let's see if we can meet in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand that $110 was a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That seems fair to me."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

We are proposing a price that matches Alice's valuation of the product. This is a strong negotiating position, as it offers her a fair deal while still giving us a significant discount from her initial asking price and John's offer."
