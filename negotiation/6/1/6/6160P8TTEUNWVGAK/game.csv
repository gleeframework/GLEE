"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it and allows for a fair profit for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings to the table is significant, especially for someone like you who can maximize its potential.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm prepared to pay. Given the value you've described, I'm willing to offer $950,000.
