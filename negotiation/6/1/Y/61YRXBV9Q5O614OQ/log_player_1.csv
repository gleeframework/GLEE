"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than my minimum ($120) but allows room for negotiation. It also sets a positive tone and tries to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of the product.  I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $135, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $125. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $125, which is just $5 less than my initial counteroffer of $135 and above my minimum of $120. It's a good deal for both of us, so I will accept Bob's offer."
