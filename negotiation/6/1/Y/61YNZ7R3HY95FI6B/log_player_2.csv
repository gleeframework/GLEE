"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

Let's try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first.  $100 is still a bit high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for further negotiation while still being significantly below my $80 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $85. What do you think?

Alice is coming down, but we're still above our target price from John. Let's see if we can push a bit further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $75?"",

We're splitting the difference again. This keeps the negotiation moving while staying below our walk-away price."

# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your target price, Bob! I can offer it to you for $80. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

Alice has met our target price. There's no point in continuing to negotiate or going with John since we've achieved the best possible outcome."
