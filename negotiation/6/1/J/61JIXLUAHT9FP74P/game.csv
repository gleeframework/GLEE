"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to offer $875,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",875000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of our product. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $925,000. This is the highest price we can offer while still considering the value provided to you and maintaining a fair profit margin for us.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $925,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still a bit hesitant. Given my budget and the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to offer $900,000.  This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I believe it could lead to a successful transaction.",900000.0,Bob,4,
