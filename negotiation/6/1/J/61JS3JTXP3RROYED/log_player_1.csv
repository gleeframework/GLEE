I'm still holding out for a higher price.  While $920,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can get a little more if I continue negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not convinced the product is worth only $920,000.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $935,000. This price is fair and will allow us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 935000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $935,000. I'm willing to pay $930,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000

While I'd prefer to get closer to $950,000, Bob's offer is getting very close to that.  Considering I have only a few rounds left, accepting his offer seems like the best course of action."
