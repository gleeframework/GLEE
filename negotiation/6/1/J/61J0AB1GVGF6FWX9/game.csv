"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $180. Could you consider that?",180.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $220. It's a fair price considering the quality and uniqueness of the product. What do you think?",220.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the value of the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $220. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $200?",200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise a bit further. I can offer it to you for $210. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",210.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $190?",190.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, Bob. However, I still think the product is worth more than $190. I'm willing to meet you at $205, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, I'd be willing to make a deal at that price. What do you think?",205.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $190 and $205. Would you consider $197.50?",197.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still think $197.50 is a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $202.50, but that's as close as I can get to your offer. If you're still interested, I'd be willing to make a deal at that price. What do you think?",202.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $195, but that's the maximum I can afford. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'll make a deal.",195.0,Bob,10,
