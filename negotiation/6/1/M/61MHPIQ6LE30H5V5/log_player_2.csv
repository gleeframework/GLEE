Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better deal.  I'll reject the offer and see if I can push her down further."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000.

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, I'm still hoping to get it lower. I'll reject this offer and try to push for a price closer to my target."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and we're only 5 rounds in.  While I'd prefer to get it even lower, $825,000 is a good deal.  It's worth accepting rather than risking getting stuck with John's higher price or potentially having Alice walk away."
