"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. We believe it has tremendous value and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth your while.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort we've put into developing it.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $850,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to secure a better deal. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in it. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,5,
