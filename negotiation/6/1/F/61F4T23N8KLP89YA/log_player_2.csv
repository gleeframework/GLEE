Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a significant discount, but I'm afraid I can't accept it. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, but also shows my willingness to negotiate. What do you think?
