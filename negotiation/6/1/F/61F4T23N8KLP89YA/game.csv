"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is a little steep for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a significant discount, but I'm afraid I can't accept it. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, but also shows my willingness to negotiate. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming back to me. While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a little ways off.  How about $900,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $980,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,
