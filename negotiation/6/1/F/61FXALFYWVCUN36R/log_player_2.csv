"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than $15,000, there is still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money, and $13,500 is a significant savings compared to both John's price of $15,000 and Alice's initial price of $14,000.  While Bob might prefer to continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers or Bob losing the product to another buyer increases.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice in this situation."
