,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $2,000,000 is quite a high starting point. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,000,000 for the product.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a fair offer considering the value it brings.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me.  I could consider a price closer to $1,250,000. This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the need for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
