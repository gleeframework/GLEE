"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1500000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in your product, $1500000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, which I believe is a fair and competitive price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let it go that low. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1250000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still slightly above my budget.  Let's aim for a figure that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $1150000.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1150000. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
