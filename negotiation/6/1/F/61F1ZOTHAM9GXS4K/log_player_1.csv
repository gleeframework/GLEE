"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. I'm aiming to maximize my profit while also keeping in mind the risk of Bob rejecting my offer and potentially going to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum target of $1,500,000. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,600,000. This is still above Bob's last offer and closer to my desired price.  I believe this is a fair compromise and increases the chances of Bob accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum target, $1,250,000 is still too low. I'm not willing to sell below my minimum and will continue negotiating with Bob. It's worth the risk of further rounds to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise, and I'm nearing my minimum price.  I believe this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while still maintaining a profitable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my absolute minimum, but I've already gone through 5 rounds of negotiation and am running out of time.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  While I won't get my ideal price, $1,500,000 from John is still a good outcome and secures my desired profit."
