Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11500} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob accepts, I'll make a good profit. If he rejects, I can still negotiate further or sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a profit that's closer to my initial goal.  This price is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's a reasonable compromise."
