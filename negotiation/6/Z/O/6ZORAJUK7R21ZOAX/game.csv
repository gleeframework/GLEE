"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product. However, $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This offer reflects the value of the product to me and allows you to make a profit as well.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1,300,000. I'm willing to compromise further and sell the product to you for $1,320,000. This is the lowest I can go and still make a decent profit.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
