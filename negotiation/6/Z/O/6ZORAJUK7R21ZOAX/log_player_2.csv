It's better to try to negotiate with Alice. You can potentially save more than the $200,000 you'd save by buying from John."

I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than my maximum budget.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can come to a more favorable price."

While I would prefer to pay less, Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is within my budget and closer to my target price. It's also a better deal than buying from John.  I'll accept the offer and move forward with the purchase."
