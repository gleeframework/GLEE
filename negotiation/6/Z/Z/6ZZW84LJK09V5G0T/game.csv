"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good price considering its value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,100,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This offer still reflects a fair deal for a product of this caliber.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go above $900,000.  I think this price is fair considering its value, and it allows us both to make a deal.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,
