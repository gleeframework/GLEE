Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. This is my maximum, and I hope we can find common ground.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $2,000,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll consider it.

We're still significantly below John's offer. It's time to see if Bob is willing to move closer to our desired range."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to come down in price, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob seems firmly rooted at $1,200,000.  It's unlikely he'll bridge the gap to a figure closer to John's offer.  To maximize profit and avoid further negotiation, it's time to move on to John."
