"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the product is worth less than $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,300,000. This price is still fair considering the value you place on the product, and it allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
