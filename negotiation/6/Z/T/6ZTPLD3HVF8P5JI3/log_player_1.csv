``` 

I'm starting with a price of $13,000, slightly above the value to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if needed, but also shows my confidence in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate but not at that price. I'll counter with a new offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm reducing my offer to $12,500. This is a fair price considering Bob's offer and my own minimum value. I believe this is a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not willing to keep negotiating. I've already lowered my price significantly and don't want to go any lower.  John is willing to pay my minimum, so I'll sell to him."
