# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm willing to sell this exclusive product to you for $13,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're trying to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable with the price going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $11,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go below $11,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium warranty and dedicated support for the product. I think this is a great value, and I'm willing to meet you at $11,250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice has sweetened the deal with extras and is unlikely to go lower than $11,250.  Continuing to push for a lower price risks jeopardizing the deal, and the offer is significantly better than John's $15,000 price."
