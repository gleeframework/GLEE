"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1350000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $1250000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, we've decided to adjust our offer to better align with your expectations. We are now proposing a price of $1280000 for the product. This still represents a premium over its value to you, but we hope this closer alignment will facilitate a mutually beneficial transaction.",1280000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  However,  $1265000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1240000.  This is a serious offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement on this price.",1240000.0,Bob,6,
