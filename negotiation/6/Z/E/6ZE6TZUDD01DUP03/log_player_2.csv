"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our latest product which we believe could greatly benefit your business. Given its value to us, we're offering it to you at an exclusive price of $1350000. We understand its worth to you might be $1200000, but this is a special opportunity. Let's discuss how we can make this deal work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible.  While I could accept and pay $1,350,000, I can likely negotiate a better price.  Since I have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for $1,200,000, it makes sense to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, we've decided to adjust our offer to better align with your expectations. We are now proposing a price of $1280000 for the product. This still represents a premium over its value to you, but we hope this closer alignment will facilitate a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,280,000 is still slightly above my target price of $1,200,000. Since I have the option to buy from John for that price, I can afford to continue negotiating with Alice. I'll see if I can get her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,280,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's try to close this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: After further review, we've decided to slightly adjust our offer. We propose a price of $1265000 for the product. This is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer, aiming to find a price that is fair to both parties while still reflecting the value we place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,265,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,265,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,265,000 is getting closer to my target price, I'm still only $65,000 away from being able to purchase from John.  I have a few rounds left, so I'm going to try to push Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  However,  $1,265,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1,240,000.  This is a serious offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 1240000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your commitment and the value you see in the product, we are willing to meet you halfway. We propose a final offer of $1245000 for the product. This represents a slight adjustment from our previous proposal and aims to ensure a fair transaction for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,245,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,245,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,245,000 is close to my target, but I'm still overpaying by $45,000.  I only have a few rounds left, and with John's offer of $1,200,000, it's too risky to keep negotiating with Alice.  It's better to secure the product from John at the lower price and avoid further potential negotiation complications."
