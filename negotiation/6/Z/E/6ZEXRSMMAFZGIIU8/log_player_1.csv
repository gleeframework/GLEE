Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value, you're subtly reminding Bob that it's worth a significant amount, justifying the higher price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, it's not explicitly mentioned to Bob. This keeps the pressure on him to make a decision without completely removing the possibility of negotiation.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a sense of getting a potentially good deal if he accepts the initial offer."
