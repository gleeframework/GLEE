"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is willing to sell for at least $800,000. This indicates there's a range where you can both benefit. Rejecting the offer allows you to explore this range further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is still a fair price considering its value to me, and it leaves room for you to make a profit. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your commitment to negotiating a lower price.  The $900,000 offer still gives Alice a profit, making it more likely she'll consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $900000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and still allows you to gain significant value from the product.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is significantly closer to your ideal price of $900,000. It's a good deal considering your maximum budget is $1,200,000.  Accepting the offer saves you $250,000 compared to buying from John, and secures the product."
