Alice's offer is way too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:

While $140 is closer to my price point, I can still get the product for $120 from John. I'll reject and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. It's getting close, but John is offering the product at a price I'm comfortable with. It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice. I'll go with John."
