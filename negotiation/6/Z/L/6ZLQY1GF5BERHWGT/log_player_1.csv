I'm offering Bob the product for $1,450,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges that the product is worth more to Bob than to me.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than I'd like, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject it for now and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000.  This is a bit lower than my initial offer, but still well within my target range.  Hopefully, this will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also willing to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what I'd prefer, but it's getting closer to my target price. I'm happy to accept it and move on.  Further negotiation might squeeze out a bit more, but the risk of losing the deal altogether outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price."
