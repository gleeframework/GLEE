"I'm interested in the product, but $999000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $850000 is a significant amount, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $925000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to get the deal done. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'd like to propose a price of $875000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get to your target, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875000.
