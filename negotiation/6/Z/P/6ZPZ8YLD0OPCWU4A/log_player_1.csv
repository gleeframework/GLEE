"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a significant discount from my minimum value ($15,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. It's high enough to potentially entice Bob, who values the product at $8,000.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob. This approach aims to build rapport and encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. Would you consider selling the product for $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I'm confident that I can achieve a better price through continued negotiation. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500:** This counteroffer represents a further compromise from my initial offer of $12,000. It's still above Bob's offer of $9,000, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate further.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes compromise and fairness, aiming to build a sense of cooperation and encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've given this some thought and I'd like to propose $10,000 as a potential price for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is getting closer to my desired price point.  While it's still below my minimum of $15,000, it's a significant improvement from his previous offer of $9,000. With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on the deal entirely. I'm willing to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
