"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product for a one-time price of $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $15000, and it's a great deal compared to the $10000 I'd be willing to accept from another buyer if you decline. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
