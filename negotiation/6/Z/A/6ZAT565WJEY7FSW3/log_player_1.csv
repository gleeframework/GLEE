{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its unique benefits. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $10,000, giving you a starting point for negotiation. 
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a price of $19,000 allows room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale to John at $15,000, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.
* **Psychology:** By framing the offer confidently and highlighting the product's value, you increase the perceived worth in Bob's mind.

**Outcome:**

* **Best Case:** Bob accepts your offer, and you earn a profit of $4,000 above your minimum.
* **Alternative:** Bob negotiates, and you can potentially settle on a price between $15,000 and $19,000. 
* **Worst Case:** Bob rejects the offer, and you sell to John for your guaranteed $15,000."
