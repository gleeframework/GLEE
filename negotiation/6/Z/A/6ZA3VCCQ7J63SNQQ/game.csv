"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. While I understand your perspective, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",900000.0,Bob,4,
