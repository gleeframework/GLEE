"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's price**, but there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price** from Alice. You have a good chance of doing so, as Alice values the product at $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between Alice's valuation ($1,000,000) and my maximum budget ($1,200,000). This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This counteroffer allows for further negotiation, giving Alice some room to counter and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within my budget and significantly lower than John's price.** 
* **Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential gains.** It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $1,075,000. 
* **Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price.**"
