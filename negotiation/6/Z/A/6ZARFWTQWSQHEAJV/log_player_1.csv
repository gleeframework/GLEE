I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'll see if Bob bites."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $999,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $999,999
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while remaining firm on the product's value."

Bob is clearly not willing to negotiate further, and his final offer matches what John is willing to pay. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob, as I'm not going to get a better price from him. I'll accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
