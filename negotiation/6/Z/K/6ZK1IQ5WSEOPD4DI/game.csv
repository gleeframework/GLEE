"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value to us, I'm proposing a price of $140 for it. I understand it's worth $120 to you, but I hope this price aligns well with your budget.",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $140 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. After considering our costs and the value we place on the product, I am able to offer it to you for $135. This is a slight adjustment from my previous proposal, aiming to find a mutually beneficial solution.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $135 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to land at $130. This would be a good price for both of us, allowing me to get the product within my budget while giving you a decent profit.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. After evaluating the situation further, I am willing to consider $132 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise, allowing you to stay within your budget while ensuring a satisfactory return for us. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",132.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $132 is a great offer, and I truly appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still just a bit short of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $128? I believe this is a fair price that would allow both of us to be satisfied with the transaction.",128.0,Bob,6,
