"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget. It's much better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's a good chance Alice is willing to come down, and you have multiple rounds to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. This shows I'm serious about buying but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm not desperate to buy from her, and I have John as a backup option at a lower price. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows I'm still interested in buying but am also willing to walk away if the price isn't right. I'm hoping this will make Alice more motivated to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, but it's still a bit too high.  Since I'm only a few rounds away from buying from John for a lower price, I'll keep pushing for a better deal. It's possible Alice is willing to drop her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. I'm offering my maximum budget. If Alice accepts, I get the product at my limit. If she rejects, I'm confident I can get a better deal with John in the next round."
