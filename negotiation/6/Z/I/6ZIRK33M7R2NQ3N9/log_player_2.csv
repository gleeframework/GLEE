"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! However,  $90 seems a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

We start with a significantly lower offer ($65) to see how much Alice is willing to budge. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $100 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $65. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $82.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value you'll get from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $82.50 is still too high. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to $70."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle on $75? It's a fair price that allows me to get a good deal while ensuring you're still making a decent profit."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

We're moving closer to a potential agreement. Offering $75 is a strategic move - it's a significant jump from our previous offer, signaling our willingness to compromise while staying within a reasonable range of Alice's valuation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm still not ready to give in just yet. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $79. It's a great price that's close to your target, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting very close to a price we'd accept, but we still have some room to negotiate. We'll try one more time to see if we can get it lower before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Alice! I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $77? That seems like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 77
}
```

We're getting closer!  Splitting the difference between her $79 and our previous $75 offer keeps the negotiation moving and maintains a good pace towards a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering you the product for $78. It's a great price that's almost there, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $78
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly signaling that this is her bottom line. Accepting $78 gets us a good deal, well below John's price and a significant savings from her initial offer. It's time to seal the deal!"
