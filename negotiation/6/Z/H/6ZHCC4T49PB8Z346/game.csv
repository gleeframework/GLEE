"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. I'm really interested in this product but my budget for it is closer to $1,050,000. I'm confident this price is still fair, given the value of the product to both of us.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer and your understanding of the value of this product. While $1,050,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for a slightly higher price point. Would you consider $1,100,000? I believe this reflects a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
