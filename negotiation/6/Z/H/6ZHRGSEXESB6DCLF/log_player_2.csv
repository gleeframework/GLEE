"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to present our latest innovation which we believe could greatly benefit your business. We understand its value to you is $1,000,000. Considering its worth to us and the market, my initial offer for the product is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to accept, it's wiser to see if you can negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This is my maximum offer, given its value to me and my current resources. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of this, I would like to propose a revised offer. For the product, I am now willing to negotiate at $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with your financial planning. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum. There's a chance she might be willing to drop the price further, so rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation going and leaves room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  My absolute maximum is $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value to me and your desire to sell the product. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your feedback, Bob. Considering your willingness to pay $1,050,000, I am prepared to accept a slightly lower price of $1,075,000 for the product. This offers a balance between meeting your budget and allowing us to sell the product at a satisfactory price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your budget, but $1,075,000 is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  John's offer of $1,000,000 is still a better deal for you.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, but if she doesn't budge, you can always switch to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire to get a good price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my limit. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is a significant compromise for me, but I believe it's a fair price given the value to me and the fact that I'm very close to my budget.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to reconsider my options."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your consideration, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to meet you halfway. Therefore, I am proposing a final offer of $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise. It's only $50,000 above John's offer, and you've already spent several rounds negotiating.  While you could continue, there's a risk Alice will become less flexible or you might run out of rounds. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for a reasonable price without further risk."
