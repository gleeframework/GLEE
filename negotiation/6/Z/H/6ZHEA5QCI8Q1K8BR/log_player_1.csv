{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that is above Bob's valuation but below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit. I'm also being friendly and encouraging to hopefully secure a deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't sell below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $105 for this product.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me there."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $100? I'm willing to make a decision soon, so I'd like to try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is still below my ideal price, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120 and it seems he's ready to close the deal.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob or losing the sale to John."
