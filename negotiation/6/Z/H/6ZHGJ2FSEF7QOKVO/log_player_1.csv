Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $200, knowing that the product is worth at least $150 to me. This leaves room for negotiation while still allowing me to potentially make a good profit.
* **Enthusiastic tone:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm not setting a firm price, but rather stating an ""offer"" to start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $200 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $150?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to accept it immediately. I want to see if I can get a higher price by countering.  Even a small increase would be better for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $175. This still gives you a great price, and it's closer to what I need to get for it."", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but not completely shutting down the negotiation.  
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my initial price and Bob's offer.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer to appeal to Bob's desire for a good deal.
* **Staying firm:** I'm not going down to $150 yet. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $175 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $162.50.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $162.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $162.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Good Deal:** Bob's offer of $162.50 is a good deal for me. It's above my minimum of $150 and represents a fair compromise. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I keep rejecting, I risk losing the deal entirely and having to sell to John for $150. 
* **Time Efficiency:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale quickly without further negotiation."
