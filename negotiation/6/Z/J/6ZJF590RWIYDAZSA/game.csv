"I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $92.50?",92.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice.  $92.50 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $88.75?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",88.75,Bob,4,
