"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $11,500. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly under her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. Rejecting her offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice that might be closer to your target price.  If she doesn't budge, you're still better off going with John."
