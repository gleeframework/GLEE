I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, giving me a decent profit while still potentially being attractive to Bob. I'll be watching Bob's response closely and adjusting my strategy based on his actions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to sell the product for $12,000, I believe I can potentially get a better price if I continue negotiating. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $14,000. This is a compromise, showing a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a decent profit margin. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price, $13,000 is still a good deal for me. It's a solid profit and I'm confident I can find another buyer if I need to in the future.  I'm choosing to accept the offer now rather than risk further negotiation and potentially getting a lower price or even losing the deal altogether."
