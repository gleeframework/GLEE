"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation ($1,000,000) and John's offer ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This might make Bob perceive subsequent offers as more reasonable, even if they are still above his valuation.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The high initial price leaves plenty of room for negotiation over the remaining rounds.  
* **Confident Tone:**  The message aims to be positive and highlight the product's value, influencing Bob's perception. 
 
It's a delicate balance between being too aggressive and leaving money on the table. This opening offer allows Alice to gauge Bob's willingness to pay and adjust her strategy accordingly in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, your initial offer of $2,200,000 is considerably above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value to you. Let's work together to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than John's standing offer of $1,500,000. While it's a step closer, Alice has plenty of room to negotiate and leverage her alternative buyer. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Alice to guide the price upwards in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and your understanding of the product's value.  To be frank, $1,100,000 is considerably below my expectations for this sale.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:**  Alice drops her price by $300,000, showing flexibility but not desperation. This keeps the price well above both Bob's offer and John's offer. 
* **Justification and Anchoring:** The message re-emphasizes the product's value and frames the new price as a significant compromise. 
* **Urgency:** By mentioning her commitment to closing the deal, Alice subtly introduces a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to respond more favorably in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers, and offer $1,500,000. This would give you a significant profit, while staying within my financial limits. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches John's offer. While Alice *might* be able to extract a little more from Bob, it's risky. There's no guarantee Bob will go any higher, and Alice could end up with a worse deal if the negotiation stalls. Accepting the $1,500,000 ensures a good profit and avoids the potential of losing both buyers."
