Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $125.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $125 starts the negotiation significantly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a deal. 
* **Alternative Buyer as Leverage:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 gives you a strong position. You don't *need* to go below $150, but aiming slightly lower with Bob might lead to a quicker sale. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** This initial offer opens the door for Bob to counter-offer. If Bob is completely uninterested at $125, you can always negotiate down slightly, staying above your minimum of $150."
