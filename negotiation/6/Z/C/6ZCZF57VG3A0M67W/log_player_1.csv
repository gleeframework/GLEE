Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob while still staying above your minimum. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $120 gives you leverage to aim higher with Bob. 

This strategy balances risk and reward. While a lower price might guarantee a sale, the higher price could lead to a better outcome without risking a loss."
