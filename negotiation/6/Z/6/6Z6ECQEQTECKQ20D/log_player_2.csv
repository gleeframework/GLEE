"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both of us if you were to acquire this item. We're offering it to you at a special price of $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $11,000, which is still more than Bob's ideal price.
* **Alternative:**  John is willing to sell for $12,000.

**Strategy:**  Bob should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. It's worth exploring if he can get closer to his target price of $10,000.  However, he should be prepared to buy from John if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Save as much money as possible, but still get the product.
* **Counteroffer:**  $10,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a fair price given Bob's maximum budget. 
* **Strategy:**  Bob is starting the negotiation by offering a price closer to his ideal price.  This move should encourage Alice to consider a lower price to secure the sale.  He's also being polite and open to negotiation, hoping for a smooth and successful transaction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To better align with your budget, I am now offering the product at $10,750. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible, but still get the product.
* **Alice's offer:**  $10,750, which is still within Bob's budget and only $750 more than his ideal price.
* **Alternative:** John is willing to sell for $12,000.

**Strategy:**  While Bob could try to push for a lower price, accepting Alice's offer makes sense. The price is close to his ideal price, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price.  It's a good compromise that ensures he gets the product without overpaying."
