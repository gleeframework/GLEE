"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing terms further.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product, which is still a significant premium considering its value to me. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,500,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident in its potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,700,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm willing to make a final offer and meet you at the middle of our previous offers. Can you consider my revised counteroffer?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
