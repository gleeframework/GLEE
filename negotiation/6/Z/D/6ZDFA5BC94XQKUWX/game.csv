"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, as it reflects the product's worth while leaving room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,150,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This price is fair considering my budget and the product's value. I hope we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to move a bit from my initial price, but $1,050,000 is still too low for me. Would you consider $1,120,000?  This price reflects the significant value this product offers and is a fair compromise, in my opinion.",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,120,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.",1080000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, I can't go as low as $1,080,000.  My final offer is $1,100,000. This represents a significant price reduction on my end and is my absolute bottom line.  Let me know if this works for you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
