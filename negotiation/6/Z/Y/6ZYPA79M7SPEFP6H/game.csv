"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to secure the product for a bit less. I'm happy to pay $700000 for it, which reflects the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to secure the product at a lower price. However, considering the product's unique features and the value it brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $725000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to reach an agreement.",725000.0,Alice,3,
