"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $12,000 is still significantly higher than the product's worth to her ($8,000). 
* There are 9 more rounds, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above the product's value to her.
* This allows for potential negotiation while also showcasing my seriousness in buying the product. 
* There are still 8 rounds remaining, so there's room to adjust the price further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price from $12,000 to $11,000. 
* While this is a good start, there's still room for negotiation.  We're closer to the product's worth, but I want to push for an even better deal. 
* There are 7 rounds remaining, which means we have time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate by reducing her price.
* I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm interested in finding a middle ground.
*  This counteroffer still keeps us well below the price I'd pay to John, and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has consistently lowered her price, and we're now at $10,500. 
* This is a good price for me, as it's significantly lower than what I'd pay John ($15,000) and is still within my budget. 
* While I could potentially push for a slightly lower price, we're at a point where further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether. There are 5 rounds remaining, which means we're halfway through the negotiation. 
* It's more advantageous to secure the product at this price than to risk further haggling and potentially being forced to buy from John at a much higher cost."
