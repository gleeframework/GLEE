"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value it brings to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a compromise that should be beneficial for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit beyond my reach.  I'm firm on my initial offer of $800,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's find a way to make this deal happen.",800000.0,Bob,4,
