{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit, knowing Bob values the product significantly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The $12,000 offer leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying well above Alice's minimum acceptable price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  The guaranteed sale to John for $8,000 provides a safety net, allowing Alice to confidently aim higher with Bob."
