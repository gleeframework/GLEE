"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is way above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $12,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $20,000 might have been a little high, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $17,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to me and the fact that I'm a serious buyer."", ""product_price"": 14000}
