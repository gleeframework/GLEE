Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $20000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see you're willing to negotiate.  $17000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $14000, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
