"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $20000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12000 is lower than I expected, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'm offering $17000.  This is a fair price considering the value and exclusivity of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see you're willing to negotiate.  $17000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $14000, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $14000 is simply too low for this product. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $15500,  which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Consider this my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
