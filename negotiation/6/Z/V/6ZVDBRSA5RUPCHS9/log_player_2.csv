"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $13,000 is still too high for Bob, as he can get the product for $12,000 from John.  There's no need to continue negotiating with Alice."
