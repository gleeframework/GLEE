Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It's below your minimum but still leaves some profit margin.
* **Is appealing to Bob:** It's lower than what the product is worth to him. 
* **Provides an incentive for Bob to accept:**  He knows he can get it cheaper than from John. 

However, be prepared to negotiate further if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum of $15,000 and also less than the $14,000 I offered initially.  I'm willing to negotiate further but won't accept such a low offer immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by reducing my price from $14,000 to $13,000.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $13,000 is still above Bob's initial offer and more than the $12,000 he's willing to spend.
* **Reiterating Value:** Emphasizing that this is still a good deal for him keeps the negotiation moving forward."
