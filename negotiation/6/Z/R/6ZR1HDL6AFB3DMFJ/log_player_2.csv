"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase my product. It's worth a significant amount to me, at least $1,000,000, but I believe it's a valuable asset for your needs as well.  I'm confident it will bring you great value.  To start our negotiation, I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above your ideal price point. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer gives you more leverage to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but I'm aiming to keep my budget under $1,200,000.  Let's start with $1,150,000.  I believe this is still a fair price, given the value you've described.  I'm open to further discussion."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial valuation.  $1,150,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $1,225,000?  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to gain something from this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your ideal price point of $1,200,000.  There are still 7 rounds left, so it's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get closer to your desired price.  While buying from John is always an option, you have a chance to get a better deal with Alice if you keep negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still hoping to stay below $1,200,000.  Let's try $1,175,000.  This is a good compromise, and we can close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
