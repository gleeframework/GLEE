"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $850,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting closer, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can do $825,000, which is a bit above your last offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
