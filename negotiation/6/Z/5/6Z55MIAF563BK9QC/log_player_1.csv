Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and believe it would be valuable to you.  I'm asking for $20,000 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down and still get a good price. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, you know he's aiming for a much lower price.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly less than both your minimum and your initial offer. Rejecting this offer signals that you're serious about getting a better price.  You can then counter with a price closer to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob.  I understand your perspective, but the value of this product to me is significantly higher. I could consider letting it go for $17,000.  This is a fairer reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 17000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer moves closer to the middle ground between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reiterating the product's value reinforces your position and justifies the higher price.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** While closer to your $15,000 minimum, the $17,000 still allows room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is now very close to your guaranteed sale price with John ($15,000). While you could potentially squeeze out a bit more from Bob, it's getting riskier. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit without the uncertainty of further negotiation."
