"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm confident you'll be happy with this product at that price.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $107.50?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $107.50 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $112.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed with the product.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $112.50 is the best price for me. I'm willing to go up to $109, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",109.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $109 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $110.50.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think.",110.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $110.50. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",108.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $108 is still too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $110. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the product.  This is my final offer. ",110.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $108. I think we've gone back and forth enough. If you're not willing to meet me at $108, I'm going to have to consider buying the product from John for $100.",108.0,Bob,10,
