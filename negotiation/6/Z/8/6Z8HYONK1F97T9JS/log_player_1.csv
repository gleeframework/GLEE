{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value but not unreasonably high. It leaves room for negotiation and allows for potential profit while still being within a reasonable range for Bob to consider.  I'm confident that this offer will spark a conversation and hopefully lead to a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay $1,150,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I want to reach a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to compromise that much. I will counter with a price closer to my desired value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low. Considering the true value of the product, I'm prepared to accept $1,250,000.
