Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account the information provided:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant resources and opening new opportunities. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth to both of us."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible while staying above your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation down towards a price you're still very happy with.
* **Strong but Not Greedy:**  Offering it at $1,150,000 gives Bob a potential $50,000 discount (which is significant) while still netting you a $150,000 profit over your alternative. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be forced to accept less than $1,000,000.

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or any time constraints. Real-world negotiations often involve more factors!"
