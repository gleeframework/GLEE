"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down a bit, especially since she values the product at $1,200,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,280,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,280,000 is within my budget and represents a significant discount from John's asking price of $1,500,000. While I could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal, and it's unlikely Alice will go much lower.  Accepting this offer is the most financially prudent decision."
