Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price. $900,000 is too low."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's split the difference.

What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1200000. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? I believe this price is more reasonable for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

While $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe I can still get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still below the value I see in this product.  Let's be realistic, though.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000 as a final compromise.  This price reflects the value for both of us, and I believe it's a fair offer.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1150000 and my target price. How about we try $1075000? This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

I'm still holding out for a higher price. While $1,075,000 is tempting, I believe there's still room for negotiation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,075,000.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more, and offer $1,125,000.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, but no higher. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below my desired price point. I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
