Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm not sure $1,200,000 is a fair price given the product's value to both of us. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000. This is a reasonable compromise and allows us to close the deal quickly.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,275,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This would allow us to close the deal without further delay, and it's a price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  What do you think?
