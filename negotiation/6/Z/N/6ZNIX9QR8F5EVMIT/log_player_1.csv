"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but not exorbitantly so. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a good profit for myself.  I'm also being friendly and optimistic to create a positive negotiating environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $18,000 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum threshold.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price that is closer to my desired value. While I can sell to John for $15,000, I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell for $15,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 15000}
