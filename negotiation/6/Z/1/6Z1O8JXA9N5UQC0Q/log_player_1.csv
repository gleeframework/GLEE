Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I make it available to other potential buyers. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it offers. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, aiming to justify the high price. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other potential buyers"" creates a subtle sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to decide quickly.

**Why not higher?**

While we could start higher, getting closer to $1,200,000 increases the risk of Bob immediately rejecting the offer. This strategy aims to strike a balance between a strong opening position and a reasonable chance of Bob accepting."
