**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown a pattern of offering incremental increases that are always below the halfway point between the current offer and his perceived value. He is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond this point.  Since we have a guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 from John, continuing the negotiation with Bob poses a greater risk of losing money than accepting the sure thing."
