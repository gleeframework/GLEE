"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $100, but still below my minimum of $120. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $110 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?"", ""product_price"": 112.50}
``` 
 
I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but still lower than my minimum.  This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while keeping my minimum price in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $109 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not going any higher than that. Can you accept $109? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, but he seems determined to get the product at a lower price. I'm going to keep negotiating and see if I can get a better deal.  It's possible I can get closer to my minimum with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $109 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but how about we settle on $111?  That's closer to your offer, and it also gets me a little closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 111}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by offering $111, which is closer to his last offer and also closer to my minimum price. This shows that I'm still open to negotiation while also setting a firm limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think that $108 is the sweet spot. It's a good price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Can you accept $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum price, and it seems like he's not willing to budge much further. At this point, I'm better off selling to John for $120, which meets my minimum requirement and saves me the time and effort of continuing to negotiate."
