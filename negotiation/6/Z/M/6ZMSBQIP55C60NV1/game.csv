"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum value and still offers you significant profit potential. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still too far below what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $950,000 is still not quite meeting my expectations.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows you to make a good profit. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
