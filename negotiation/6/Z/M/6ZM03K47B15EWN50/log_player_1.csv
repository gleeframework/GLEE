"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** By starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and your minimum, you establish a strong anchor. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This high starting point leaves ample room for negotiation and potential counteroffers. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer helps gauge Bob's interest level and willingness to engage in a negotiation.

It's a balancing act! While we want to maximize profit, we also need to avoid alienating Bob with an unrealistically high price, especially in this initial stage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price closer to what both of us are comfortable with. My counteroffer is $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a tempting offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price. You have room to negotiate and try to bring Bob closer to your desired range. Selling to John at this point would mean leaving potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective.  To move things forward, I propose a price of $1,150,000. This feels like a fair reflection of the product's value."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We are making a significant concession from our initial price to demonstrate willingness to negotiate and find common ground. 
* **Holding Ground:**  The new price is still substantially above Bob's offer and closer to your minimum. This signals that you're serious about the value you place on the product.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By making a counteroffer, we keep the negotiation alive and encourage Bob to continue engaging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Strong Position:** You've successfully negotiated Bob up from his initial offer of $900,000.
* **Time Consideration:**  While you could potentially push for more in the remaining rounds, there's also a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of prolonged negotiation."
