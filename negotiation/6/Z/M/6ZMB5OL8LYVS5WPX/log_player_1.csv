Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $130 again, but this time I'm willing to add a small concession - I'll throw in an extra service that's worth $20. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130 and accept the extra service? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 
This is a good deal for Alice. Even though Bob is offering a price below Alice's desired minimum ($150), the additional $20 worth of service makes this deal profitable. The price is close enough to Alice's minimum that the risk of rejection from Bob in further negotiation isn't worth it. Also, the time constraint of 10 rounds encourages Alice to accept the offer before she has to sell to John."
