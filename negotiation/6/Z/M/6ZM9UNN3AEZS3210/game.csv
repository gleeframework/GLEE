,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're eager to close the deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,125,000.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,175,000? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away satisfied.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the compromise.  How about we settle at $1,150,000 and call it a deal?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
