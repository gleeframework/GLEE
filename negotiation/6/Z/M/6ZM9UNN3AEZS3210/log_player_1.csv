Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're eager to close the deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,125,000.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,175,000? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1175000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.
