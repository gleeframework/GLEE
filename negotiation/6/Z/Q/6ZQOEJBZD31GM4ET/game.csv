"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $850,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, and I'm willing to move a bit. How about $750,000? That's a significant step up from my previous offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still not quite there for me.  Given the value of this product to you, I believe $825,000 is a fair compromise.  It's a significant step up from your last offer, and I'm confident this price would still be a good investment for you. What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,
