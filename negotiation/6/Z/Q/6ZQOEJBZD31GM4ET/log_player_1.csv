Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not going for the full $1,000,000 immediately to allow for potential counteroffers and a smoother negotiation process.
* **John as a safety net:**  By mentioning John's offer, I'm subtly implying that I have other options, which could put pressure on Bob to accept a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. How about $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly lower than my desired price and even below Bob's own perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested, and there's room for further negotiation. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering, I can potentially reach a price closer to my target. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me leverage and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $850,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:** I'm aiming for a compromise while still maximizing my profit.
* **Splitting the difference:** Offering $850,000 (the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's) shows a willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Reinforcing value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to him to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a positive and open tone to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, and I'm willing to move a bit. How about $750,000? That's a significant step up from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's an improvement, $750,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm aiming for a much higher return on this product.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Bob is clearly interested in buying and is willing to increase his offer. This indicates that there's still room for negotiation. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000, which gives me leverage to hold out for a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob again, aiming to secure a price closer to $850,000 or higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still not quite there for me.  Given the value of this product to you, I believe $825,000 is a fair compromise.  It's a significant step up from your last offer, and I'm confident this price would still be a good investment for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:** I'm aiming to narrow the gap between our offers while still securing a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Compromise approach:** Offering $825,000 (closer to my previous offer of $850,000) shows a willingness to compromise and find common ground.
* **Reinforcing value:** I continue to remind Bob of the product's value to him to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  I maintain a positive and encouraging tone to maintain a good rapport with Bob and keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Additional notes:**

* This counteroffer leaves some room for further negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely make a final counteroffer at $800,000 before resorting to selling to John. 
*  I'm still confident in my ability to secure a price closer to my target, as Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer."
