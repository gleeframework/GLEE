Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It's also below Bob's perceived value, giving him a potential gain while still yielding a substantial profit for you.  

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $950000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is still a significant profit, there's room for improvement. Bob's offer is close to what you'd get from John, so it's worth pushing for a higher price.  Let's counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This would still leave you with a healthy profit margin, and it's a fair price for the value of this product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to counter your offer at $875000. This price reflects both the value of the product to me and my budgetary constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

Bob's offer is very close to your minimum price and significantly higher than what you would get from John.  It's time to close the deal."
