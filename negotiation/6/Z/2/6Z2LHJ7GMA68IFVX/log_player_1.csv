Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to negotiate, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product is worth $100 to you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's still a decent profit for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely. I'm also running out of rounds and don't want to risk selling to John for a lower price."
