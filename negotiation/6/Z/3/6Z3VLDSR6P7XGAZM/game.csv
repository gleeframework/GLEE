"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $110?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more of what I need.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $100.  This is my final offer, as I can purchase the product elsewhere for that price.  Let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Bob,4,
