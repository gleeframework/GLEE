{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it's worth at least $150.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $110?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more of what I need.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $100.  This is my final offer, as I can purchase the product elsewhere for that price.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
