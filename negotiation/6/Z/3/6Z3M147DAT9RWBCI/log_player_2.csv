It's not worth paying more than your limit of $10,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still within my budget. Hopefully, it's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."

Alice's offer is now within my budget, and it's a good deal considering she initially wanted $12,000.  I'm willing to accept this offer and buy the product."
