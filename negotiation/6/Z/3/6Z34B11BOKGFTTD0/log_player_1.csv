Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm setting the price at $20,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  While we know Bob's perceived value is lower, starting with an ambitious offer above your minimum allows room for negotiation. It also positions the product as potentially more valuable in Bob's mind. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value and interest,"" you subtly create a sense of demand and scarcity, even if Bob is your only current prospect.
* **Leave Room for Counter:** The tone is open for discussion (""What do you think?""), encouraging Bob to engage and potentially counter-offer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., is he easily offended by high prices?), adjust accordingly.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If you need to sell quickly, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective.
* **Your Risk Tolerance:**  Starting very high risks Bob walking away immediately. Gauge if it's worth the gamble. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still leaving a chance for Bob to accept. If he rejects the offer, you have your backup buyer, John."
