{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm offering the product at $110, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm offering $100, which is still above Bob's offer, but a step closer to his price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $100 is a good deal. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob has come up slightly, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I don't want to risk further negotiation, and John is a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my requirements. I'm going to sell the product to John."
