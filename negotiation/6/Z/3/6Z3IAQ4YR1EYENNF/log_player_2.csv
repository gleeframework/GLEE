You can do better than $110. You can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $105?  That's still a good price for you, and it fits my budget."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
The offer from Alice is close enough to your target price of $100.  Accepting is the best option as any further negotiation is likely to push the price closer to John's price."
