,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While I see the value of the product, $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $85 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $92.50. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $92.50 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $88.75.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",88.75,Bob,4,

"I understand that $88.75 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm thinking of a price of $90. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and it's still a bit higher than your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a good deal for my product.",90.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  I'm willing to go up to $89.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",89.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $89 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm thinking of a price of $91. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and it's still a bit higher than your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a good deal for my product.",91.0,Alice,7,
