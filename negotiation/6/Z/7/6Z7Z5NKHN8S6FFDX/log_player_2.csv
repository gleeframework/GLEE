You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can still potentially get a better deal from Alice.  Rejecting her offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price. You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so you have room to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a significant discount.  It's a good starting point, and you can adjust your counteroffers based on Alice's responses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now $1,080,000, which is within your budget and a better price than John's $1,200,000.  There's no guarantee you'll get a lower price from Alice, and you're risking losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer is the most logical choice."
