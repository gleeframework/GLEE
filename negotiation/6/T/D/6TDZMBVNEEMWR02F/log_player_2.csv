"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

* **Value:** While Alice tries to inflate the perceived value, you know your maximum price is $1,500,000.  $1,300,000 is a significant discount.
* **Risk:**  There's no guarantee you can negotiate a better price with Alice. Accepting now secures the product at a good price."
