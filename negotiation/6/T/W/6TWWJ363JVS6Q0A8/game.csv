"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $650,000 for it. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $650,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we settle somewhere in the middle, say around $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $750,000 is still below my minimum, and I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
