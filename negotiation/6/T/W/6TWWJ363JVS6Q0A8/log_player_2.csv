Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $650,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $750,000 is still below my minimum, and I'm not willing to go that low.
