,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $7,000 is a bit lower than I can accept, I'm open to further discussion. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still allows me to make a fair profit while offering you a great deal. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your persistence.  $8,500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $9,500. This offer acknowledges your budget, but also reflects the true value of this incredible product. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,
