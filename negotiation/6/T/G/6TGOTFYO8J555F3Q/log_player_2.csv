Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $7,000 is a bit lower than I can accept, I'm open to further discussion. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still allows me to make a fair profit while offering you a great deal. What do you think?

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I think there's been a mistake. I previously chose to reject Alice's offer and consider buying from John instead of making another counteroffer. Let me correct that.

Since I'm not willing to pay $9,500, I'll make another counteroffer to Alice. I'll try to meet her halfway, but this time at a price that's closer to what I'm willing to pay.
