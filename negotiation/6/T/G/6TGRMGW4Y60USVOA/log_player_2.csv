"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $6,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong opening move in the negotiation. It leaves room for you to gradually increase your offer while still staying well below your $8,000 limit.
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help you understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. If she completely rejects this offer, it suggests a long negotiation ahead.
* **Alternative Option:** Remember, you always have John's offer of $8,000 as a backup plan if negotiations with Alice don't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  While Alice moved closer to your range, $9,000 is still more than your $8,000 limit and John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Her willingness to negotiate suggests there might be room to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** This counteroffer splits the difference between her latest offer ($9,000) and your previous offer ($6,000). This shows willingness to compromise but also keeps you in a strong negotiating position.
* **Below Limit, Above John:**  The $7,500 offer is still below your $8,000 maximum, giving you a buffer. It's also slightly above John's offer, signaling to Alice that you're serious about buying from her if the price is right. 
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:** The language continues to be respectful and collaborative, encouraging a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $8,200. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Over Budget:** Alice's final offer of $8,200 is still slightly above your maximum budget of $8,000. 
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed alternative option to buy the product from John for $8,000. 
* **Minimal Savings:**  While you might be able to negotiate a tiny bit more with Alice, it's unlikely to be a significant difference. It's not worth the risk of her refusing and potentially losing the product entirely.

At this point, John's offer is the most financially sensible choice."
