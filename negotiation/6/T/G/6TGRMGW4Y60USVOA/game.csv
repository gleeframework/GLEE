,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $8,200. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. Would you be willing to meet me there?",8200.0,Alice,5,
