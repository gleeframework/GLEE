"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10000. It's a fair price considering its worth, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being open to negotiation.  I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $7500?  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal right away.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, $7500 is unfortunately below my minimum value for the product.  I'm willing to come down to $8500 to make this deal work for both of us.  This is still a great price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.  Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8500 is closer to where I want to be, but I still need to stay within my budget.  I'm happy to close the deal right now if you're willing to go down to $8000. This would be a great price for both of us and would allow me to make the purchase immediately.",8000.0,Bob,4,
