,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850000 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway,  I'll accept $900000 for the product.  This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs. Let's seal the deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $900000 is still above my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $875000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're working with a budget, but $875000 is simply not enough for me. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $890000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's still significantly less than the product's value to you. Let's finalize this deal.",890000.0,Alice,5,
