"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits it could bring to my business. I'm open to negotiations and willing to work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down a bit and offer the product for $1,250,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but it's closer to your offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can make it work.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
