Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another interested party."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin.
* **Leverage the ""John"" Factor:**  Mentioning another interested party creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, making Bob more inclined to act quickly.
* **Value Justification:** While not explicitly stating Bob's perceived value, the message implies the product is worth a premium due to its exclusivity and desirability. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and ensuring Bob doesn't walk away to John's offer."
