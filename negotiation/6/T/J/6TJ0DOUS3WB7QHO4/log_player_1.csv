Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,275,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000, but I need to be honest, I'm not comfortable going above that. Can you consider meeting me at $1,200,000?

Bob seems firmly anchored at $1,200,000.  While further negotiation is possible, it's unlikely to yield a result significantly better than John's guaranteed offer. Accepting John's offer ensures I receive the product's full value to me."
