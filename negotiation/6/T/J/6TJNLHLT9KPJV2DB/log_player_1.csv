Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable value.  I'm curious to see if Bob is interested in this initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than selling to John, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering $135 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be attractive enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $125. This is a good deal for me, as it is higher than selling to John and is getting closer to my desired price.  There is always a risk that I could reject this offer and continue negotiating, but at this point, I think it's better to secure the sale and avoid further back-and-forth."
