"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to make this deal work. Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $10,250? That's a fair compromise, and it gives you a great price on this valuable product.",10250.0,Alice,5,
