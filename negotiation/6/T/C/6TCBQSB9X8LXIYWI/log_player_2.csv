Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to make this deal work. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $9,750?"",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $10,250? That's a fair compromise, and it gives you a great price on this valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $10,250.  You're already very close to your absolute best price with John, and further haggling with Alice has a risk of ending with no deal at all. It's time to secure the product at the guaranteed best price."
