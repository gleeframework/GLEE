"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. This product is a unique opportunity that won't easily be found elsewhere. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but my price reflects the true value and potential of this product. I've had significant interest from other buyers, including one who's ready to purchase it at my asking price of $1,000,000.  I'm offering you a final opportunity to secure this deal at $800,000.  This is my last offer, after which I'll be moving forward with the other buyer.",800000.0,Alice,5,
