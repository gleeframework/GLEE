"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $1,050,000? I think that's a fair starting point.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for this incredible product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
