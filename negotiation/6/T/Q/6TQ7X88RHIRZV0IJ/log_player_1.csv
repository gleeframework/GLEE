Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming for a good profit, and this offer is well above your $800,000 minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's space for him to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **It's a strong opening position:**  It shows you're confident in the product's value and are not willing to give it away cheaply.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than the value I believe the product has.  It's worth pushing for a higher price. 

I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still confident this product is worth closer to $900,000.  This counteroffer is a compromise, but it still leaves room for Bob to make a final counteroffer if he's truly interested in the product."
