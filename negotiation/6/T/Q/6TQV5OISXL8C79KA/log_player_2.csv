"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it holds immense value.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget, so it's worth exploring if I can get a better deal. There's also the possibility that Alice doesn't truly understand the product's value and might be willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  while your product is interesting, $1,000,000 is significantly below my initial assessment. I'm willing to offer you $750,000 for it. This represents a fair compromise and allows for a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  The price is still higher than what I'd be willing to pay from John, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  Given the unique potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $900000. This reflects a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us. Let's find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, but it's still above my initial target. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can find a price closer to my preferred range. There's still room for compromise, and I don't want to rush into a deal that's not optimal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Given our previous discussions, I'm offering $800,000. This represents a significant step towards a fair agreement.  I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to bridge the gap between Alice's offer and my initial target. It shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a reasonable price. The message emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial solution, fostering a cooperative tone for continued negotiation."
