"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it holds immense value.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Opening with a high price of $1,000,000 establishes a strong initial bargaining position. 
* **Focus on Value:** Highlighting the product's uniqueness and potential value aims to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open-ended Question:**  Asking for Bob's thoughts allows for a conversation and potential for him to reveal his own valuation.

**Important Note:** I've chosen a significantly higher starting price than your minimum. This is a strategic move to leave room for negotiation and potentially achieve a higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while your product is interesting, $1000000 is significantly below my initial assessment. I'm willing to offer you $750000 for it. This represents a fair compromise and allows for a smooth transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.** While it's a compromise, it's still not profitable enough for me given the product's value.
* **There are still more rounds to negotiate.**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and try to close the deal closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is still an option.** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still secure a reasonable profit by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  Given the unique potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us. Let's find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering with a price of $900,000, which is still above my minimum but significantly lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's unique potential to justify the price.
* **Mutual Agreement:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a way to find a ""mutually agreeable solution"", appealing to Bob's sense of fairness. 
* **Concession:** I'm acknowledging that this is a ""significant concession"" to emphasize my willingness to meet halfway. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I secure a profitable sale.
* If Bob rejects, I can further adjust my offer depending on his counteroffer, keeping in mind that I can still sell to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit high for me. Given our previous discussions, I'm offering $800000. This represents a significant step towards a fair agreement.  I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum price.**  $800,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product, and it represents a decent profit. 
* **No need to risk further negotiation.** There's no guarantee that I can get a higher price in the remaining rounds, and I could potentially end up with a lower offer or even sell to John for the same price.
* **Securing the deal now is the safest option.** Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
