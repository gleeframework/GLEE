"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  It's in my best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is a significant investment for me and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Strong:** I'm opening with a counteroffer close to my absolute maximum, but still lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about purchasing but also sets the tone for negotiation.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my offer, highlighting the investment for me and suggesting fairness. This can make the counteroffer more palatable for Alice. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room for both of us to move closer to a mutually acceptable price in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a great deal for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still significantly higher than what I can afford. I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This represents a considerable compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering our respective positions."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm moving slightly closer to Alice's price, showing that I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise. 
* **Staying Within Budget:** $950,000 is still within my budget, but it also leaves some room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I reiterate the fairness of my offer, considering both our perspectives. This can help keep the negotiation constructive."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $950,000. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a significant improvement, it's still outside of my budget. I'm determined to get the product for closer to my maximum of $800,000.

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to be flexible, and I appreciate your offers so far.  However, $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This represents a substantial compromise on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair price given our individual positions."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $975,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and it reflects a significant compromise on my part. I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 975000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $975,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still too high. We've reached the 9th round, and with only one more round left, I'm unlikely to convince Alice to go lower. It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John for $800,000, rather than risk losing the opportunity entirely."
