"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  $1,500,000 is a strong opening offer, but I'm aware that I can always fall back on John's offer if Bob doesn't bite.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation,  $900,000 is significantly less than what I consider the product's worth.  I'll counter with a higher price in the next round, aiming for a compromise that still benefits me.  If Bob continues to lowball, I'll be prepared to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm moving down from my initial offer, but still holding firm on a price that reflects the value of the product.  $1,200,000 is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful Bob will see it that way.  If he rejects, I'll re-evaluate my position, but I'm still not willing to drop below my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While he's showing a willingness to move up, $950,000 is still below my acceptable threshold. I'll counter again in the next round, aiming for a more favorable price.  I'm getting closer to John's offer, so I'm considering the option of selling to him if we don't come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my desired value. $1,100,000 is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. If Bob rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John as we're getting very close to his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm only $20,000 away from John's offer, and there's a risk that Bob might continue to stall. I'll counter with a price closer to his offer, but I'm prepared to sell to John if he rejects."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

This is my final attempt to reach an agreement with Bob.  $1,050,000 is a significant compromise, and I'm only $50,000 away from John's offer. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be forced to sell to John, even though I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. He's not budging, and I'm only $10,000 away from John's offer. It's not worth risking another round of negotiation with Bob when I have a guaranteed sale with John."
