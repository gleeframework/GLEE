Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $1,200,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. While I understand your perspective on the price,  $1,200,000 would be undervaluing the product significantly.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  While $1,850,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $1,450,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating willingness to negotiate. While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's still room to secure a better deal with Bob. We are aiming for at least $1,600,000."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down further. I'm getting closer to what I can do.  How about $1,500,000 even?  That's the best I can offer.

**Reasoning:**  Bob has reached our absolute floor and the same offer as our backup with John. There's no further room for negotiation without risking a worse outcome. Accepting now secures the known value."
