"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. Looking forward to your response.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not able to go as low as $1,400,000.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate the reduction, I still need to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000 for the product.
