"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $12,000, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit and ensures you get a valuable product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $13,500 doesn't quite cover my costs.  Let's split the difference and go with $14,250.  This would give us both a good deal and allow me to move forward with the sale.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $14,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",13750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to reach a deal.  $13,750 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000 as a final compromise. It's a good price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the sale.  Let me know if you're open to this final offer.",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a good price for both of us, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,900, but that's the absolute maximum I can afford. Can you meet me at that price?",13900.0,Bob,8,
