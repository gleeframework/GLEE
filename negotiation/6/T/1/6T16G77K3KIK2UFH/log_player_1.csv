Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price, considering the market value and the potential returns I can expect from this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $750,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $925,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I really think $825,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could counteroffer again, Bob is clearly trying to stay in a reasonable range and has shown a willingness to negotiate. Accepting $825,000 is a solid profit above my minimum, and it avoids the risk of him lowering his offer further or the negotiation stalling."
