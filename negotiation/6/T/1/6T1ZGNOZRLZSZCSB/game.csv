"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a much lower price. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  However, my initial offer reflects the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction and a fair offer considering the value it brings.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but that's still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  To be frank, I'm targeting a price closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in that range?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some real potential here for us to make a deal.  While $700,000 is too low, I'm willing to consider a compromise. How about we settle on $1,600,000? This reflects the product's worth while recognizing your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a significant gap.  $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?  That's the absolute highest I can go.",800000.0,Bob,6,
