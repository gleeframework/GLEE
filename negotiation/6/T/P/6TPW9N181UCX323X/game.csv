"Alice, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $9,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you is $8,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500. That's a fair compromise considering we're both trying to reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm offering it to you for $10,250. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10250.0,Alice,5,
