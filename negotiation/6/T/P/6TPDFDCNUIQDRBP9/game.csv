,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $14000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $14500? It's a compromise that should work for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $14500 is still a bit too high. I'm confident that we can find a deal that benefits both of us. I'm sticking with my offer of $13000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to be more flexible, Bob, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we meet in the middle again, but this time at $14000? It's a fair price that should work for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find common ground, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to secure this product at a price closer to $13000.  Maybe if we split the difference at $13500, we can both walk away happy.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13500. How about we compromise at $14250? It's a bit above your latest offer, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for both of us.",14250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my target price. While I understand you need to make a profit, $14250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference again and agree on $13750.  This would give us both a fair deal and allow us to close this transaction.",13750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13750. I'm willing to meet you at $14000 again, but this is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,9,
