"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value. To be fair to both of us, I could let it go for $1,700,000. This is a significant reduction on my initial price and reflects my willingness to make this deal work.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my valuation. Let's find a middle ground.  How about $1,450,000? This represents a significant price reduction on my part and brings us closer to a deal.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
