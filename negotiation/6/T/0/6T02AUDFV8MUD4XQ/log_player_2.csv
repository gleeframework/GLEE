Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay from John. There's still potential to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now higher than what Bob is willing to pay from John.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John and secure the lower price. Further negotiation with Alice might lead to a lower price, but there's no guarantee. It's safer to lock in the lower price from John."
