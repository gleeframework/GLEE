"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its potential.  I'm asking $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my opportunity cost of selling it to another buyer. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. Let me know your thoughts.
