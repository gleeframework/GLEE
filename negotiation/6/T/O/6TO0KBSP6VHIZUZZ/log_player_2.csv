"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. $1,100,000 is still above Bob's maximum price.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate, and there's a good chance Alice will lower her price.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** If the negotiations with Alice fail, Bob can still buy the product from John, although at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000. This product is valuable to me, but I'm working within a tight budget. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:** Bob is starting with a lower price, but it's not an unreasonable offer. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above Alice's minimum value. This shows Bob is serious about negotiating but is also willing to compromise.
* **Emphasis on budget:** Bob mentions his budget to create a sense of urgency and potentially push Alice to consider a lower price.
* **Open to compromise:** The message ends on a positive note, signaling that Bob is open to negotiating and finding a solution that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're working with a tight budget, Bob, but I believe the product's value exceeds $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Bob has 7 rounds left, and Alice has already shown flexibility.  
* **Buying from John is still a fallback option.**  Bob can always go to John if he can't get a better deal from Alice. 
* **Strategic counteroffer is possible.**  Bob can counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his ideal $950,000 mark, or try a slightly higher counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. While I see the value of the product, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. If we can reach an agreement at that price, I'm ready to move forward.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight increase, showing willingness to compromise:** Bob is increasing his offer from $950,000 to $1,000,000, showing Alice that he's serious about reaching a deal.
* **Focus on finding a solution:** The message emphasizes finding a solution that benefits both parties, fostering a collaborative tone.
* **Firm but fair price:**  $1,000,000 is still below Alice's offer, but it's closer to her minimum.  This might incentivize Alice to accept, or at least make a counteroffer closer to Bob's desired price.
* **Open door for further negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for further negotiation, signaling that Bob is willing to continue discussing until a mutually acceptable price is found."
