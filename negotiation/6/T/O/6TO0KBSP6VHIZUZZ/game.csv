"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000. This product is valuable to me, but I'm working within a tight budget. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're working with a tight budget, Bob, but I believe the product's value exceeds $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. While I see the value of the product, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. If we can reach an agreement at that price, I'm ready to move forward.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
