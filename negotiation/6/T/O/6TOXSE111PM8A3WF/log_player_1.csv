Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, knowing that the product is worth $12,000 to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering $14,000 allows for potential counteroffers and gives Bob the feeling that he can get a better deal.
* **Staying above my minimum:** I'm still above my minimum value of $15,000, meaning I won't lose money if Bob rejects my offer.
* **Positive messaging:** The message is friendly and encouraging, hoping to create a positive negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,500 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000 and also below the value of the product to Bob ($12,000).  Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I have room to negotiate with Bob.  He has shown interest and is willing to pay more than my minimum.
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000 allows me to be more assertive in my negotiations with Bob.

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great deal for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob:** I'm reducing my price to $12,500, which is still above my minimum, but shows I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Playing on value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Fair price language:** I'm emphasizing that $12,500 is a ""fair price for both of us"" to make it seem like a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open to continue the negotiation."
