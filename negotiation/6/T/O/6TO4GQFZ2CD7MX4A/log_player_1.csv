Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to both of us, so let's find a price that works for both sides. I'm starting at $1,400,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $1,000,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little.  I'm proposing $1,250,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm willing to move a little closer to your number. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I think I can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  $1,125,000 is a good offer, but I'm still holding out for a little more. How about we settle on $1,175,000? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away feeling good about the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1175000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I'm willing to go up a little bit, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $1,150,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum and it's better than selling to John for $1,200,000. With only 4 rounds left, I'm not sure if I can get a better deal with Bob."
