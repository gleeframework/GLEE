Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $10,000. I believe it presents significant value, though I understand you may have a different price in mind. Feel free to counter if this offer doesn't work for you, as I'm open to finding an agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no reason to go below that price.  Starting high establishes a strong position.
* **Openness to negotiation:** The message acknowledges that Bob might have a different valuation. This leaves room for negotiation and potential counter-offers, maximizing the chances of a deal within Bob's perceived value range ($8,000 - $10,000).
* **Polite and professional tone:** Maintaining a positive and respectful tone encourages a constructive negotiation process.

**It's important to note:** This is a starting strategy.  You can always adjust your approach based on Bob's response and willingness to negotiate."
