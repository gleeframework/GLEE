"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset with significant potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000) but still below Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Leaving Room:** A $1,200,000 price point leaves room for Bob to counter without feeling he's getting a bad deal, especially since he values the product at $800,000.
* **Building Interest:** The message emphasizes the value and potential of the product, aiming to pique Bob's interest and potentially increase his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000).**  Selling to John at that price would be a better outcome for me at this point.
* **I need to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price.** While I could sell to John now, I have 8 rounds left. It's worth seeing if I can negotiate a better price with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer in Round 3 with a price higher than $900,000 but still lower than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and your budget. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my own interests.
* **Compromise:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a compromise to encourage Bob to see it as a fair deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive tone in the message to maintain a constructive negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.

**Outcome:** I hope this counteroffer will convince Bob to accept a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. Selling to John would be a more profitable option at this point.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I still have 6 rounds left, and there's potential for Bob to increase his offer further.  If I can push him closer to my minimum, it might be worth it to keep negotiating.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob in Round 5 with a price higher than $950,000, but still lower than my previous offer.  The goal is to continue inching closer to a mutually agreeable price while keeping the option of selling to John open if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to consider a price of $1,050,000. This reflects the product's unique value and allows for a reasonable margin for both of us.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** I'm narrowing the gap between our offers, moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique value to justify the price point.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the counteroffer as an opportunity for a mutually beneficial agreement, emphasizing a win-win scenario.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and constructive tone encourages Bob to continue negotiating. 

**Outcome:** I hope this counteroffer will convince Bob to accept a price closer to my desired value. If he rejects, I'll re-evaluate the situation and weigh the potential of further negotiation against the certainty of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a reasonable margin, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Low:** Bob's offer of $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** We are now in Round 6, with only 4 rounds left. I need to be decisive.
* **Certainty vs. Potential:** It's risky to continue negotiating with Bob. While there's a possibility he might increase his offer, it's not guaranteed. Selling to John provides a certain and profitable outcome. 

**Conclusion:** Given the limited rounds left and the risk of not reaching a satisfactory agreement with Bob, I've chosen to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  This secures a profit and ensures I meet my minimum acceptable value."
