Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product for $95, which is above Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for potential counteroffers and gives me a chance to earn more than I would selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $70 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum threshold of $100. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $70 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $85? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I could go up to $75, but that's really the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob. I believe I can get closer to my goal of $100 by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're at your limit, but $75 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $80.  This would be a fair compromise and would allow us both to get a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}
