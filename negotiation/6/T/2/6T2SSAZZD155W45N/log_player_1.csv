Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but I am only able to pay up to $100 for it. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than $80, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $100 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $110? It's a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your offer and while I'm willing to pay more than $100, I would like to propose $105 as the price for the product. This seems to be a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, $105 is a good compromise. It's more than what John would pay and still allows for a decent profit.  Accepting Bob's offer is the best move in this situation."
