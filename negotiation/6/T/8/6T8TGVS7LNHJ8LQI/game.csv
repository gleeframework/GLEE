"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and above my minimum price. Let me know what you think.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,400,000? This would still leave you a good profit margin, and it would allow me to move closer to my desired price.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so how about $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Bob,4,
