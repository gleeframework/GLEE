Alice's offer is way too high.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm offering Alice my maximum price, $80.  This is the price I'm willing to pay, and it's also the price I can get from John. If she rejects, I'll go with John."

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm going to reject and try one more counteroffer. If she rejects this one, I'll buy from John."
