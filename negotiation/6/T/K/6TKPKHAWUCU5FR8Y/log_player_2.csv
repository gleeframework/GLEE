"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the product for a price of $10,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

You can do better than $10,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is a good deal.  You're saving $2,500 compared to buying from John.  It's still a bit above your ideal price, but it's a good compromise."
