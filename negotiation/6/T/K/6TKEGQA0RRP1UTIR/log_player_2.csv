"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a rare opportunity to acquire a unique item that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John at $15,000.  There's a chance you could get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. You're willing to lose a bit on the deal to potentially save $1,000."
