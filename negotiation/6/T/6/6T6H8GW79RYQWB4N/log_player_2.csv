"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's valuation of $8,000. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about we split the difference at $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still a little higher than $9,000. Let's meet in the middle at $9,250. It's a good price for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $9,250 is still more than Bob is comfortable paying. Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, and there's still room to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $9,250 is still a bit out of my price range. Let's meet at $9,100. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to go a bit further to make this work for both of us.  Let's settle on $9,150. This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,150, which is very close to Bob's last offer of $9,100.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, the potential savings are small.  At this point, it's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and secure the product for a price that's significantly lower than John's offer of $10,000."
