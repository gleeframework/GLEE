"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about we split the difference at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still a little higher than $9,000. Let's meet in the middle at $9,250. It's a good price for both of us!",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $9,250 is still a bit out of my price range. Let's meet at $9,100. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests.",9100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to go a bit further to make this work for both of us.  Let's settle on $9,150. This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal.",9150.0,Alice,5,
