"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is highly valued by our company at $8000. Considering its quality and unique features, I believe it would be an excellent addition to your collection. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$8,000 is a good starting point, but I can potentially do better.**  I'm willing to pay up to $10,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to lower the price.** This will give me information to make a more informed counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $8,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it. Let me know if you're open to that price."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate. Based on your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $7500 for the product. This still reflects its high value and quality, while being more in line with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is now closer to my desired price.**  $7,500 is only $500 above my initial counteroffer. 
* **Further negotiation is possible, but the risk increases.**  There's a chance Alice might be stubborn, or I might not be able to get a better price.
* **Time is a factor.**  While I have 7 more rounds, I don't want to risk losing a good deal by being overly cautious.
* **$7,500 is a good compromise.**  It allows me to save money compared to John's offer and still get a high-quality product."
