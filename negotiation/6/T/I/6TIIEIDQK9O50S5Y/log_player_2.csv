"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I know it holds significant value for you as well.  I'm offering it to you for $1050000. This price allows for a mutually beneficial transaction and ensures a smooth and efficient exchange.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000 for the product.
* Alice is offering it for $1,050,000, which is more than your maximum.
* You have a guaranteed alternative with John who will sell it to you for your maximum price.

Therefore, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
