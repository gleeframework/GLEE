"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $120 was a bit high for you, Bob. However, I've done some research and found that similar products are selling for around $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really keen on this product, but I can't go above $95.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I want to try to meet you in the middle. I'll offer it to you for $105, which is a bit above your last offer, but still below the market value I've researched.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really pushing my budget here, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. This is my final offer.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, but I've already established a minimum price for the product that I'm comfortable with. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'll give you one more chance to meet my price, but I'm not budging below $110. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",110.0,Alice,7,
