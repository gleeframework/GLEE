"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than what you're willing to pay, there's still room for negotiation to potentially get a better price. You should try to counteroffer and see if you can get a lower price closer to Alice's value of $1,000,000."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your ideal price, you're still paying a significant premium compared to her valuation. It's worth trying to counteroffer again and see if you can push her further towards your target price. You can offer slightly higher than her valuation, but still lower than her last offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm getting a bit concerned about the product's value to me. After reconsidering, I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1080000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1500000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to ensure I'm getting a decent return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is only $80,000 above her valuation and significantly lower than your initial budget of $1,500,000.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will be tough and could lead to a breakdown. Accepting the offer secures a good deal and ensures you get the product without risking a stalemate or needing to buy from John at a much higher price."
