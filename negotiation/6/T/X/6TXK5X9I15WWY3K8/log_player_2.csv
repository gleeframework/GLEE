"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Let me know if you're willing to come down a bit."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,500 is within Bob's budget and represents a good compromise. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product for a price lower than John's offer, while still leaving a little room for negotiation in future rounds if necessary."
