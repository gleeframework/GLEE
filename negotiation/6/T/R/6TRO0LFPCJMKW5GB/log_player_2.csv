"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by previous customers. I believe it could be a great asset for you, considering its worth. Let's discuss a fair price. My initial offer is $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To find common ground, I would like to propose an offer of $95 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the value of the item. Please let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully get closer to his $80 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $95 is closer, but I'm still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $90? I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price if we keep working together."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress. Considering the value of the product and your budget, I'd like to suggest an offer of $92. This seems to be a reasonable midpoint between our positions. I hope you'll find this acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $92 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum of $80.  At this point, Bob has been negotiating for a while and it's unlikely Alice will come down further.  It's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John, ensuring he gets the product within his budget."
