"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that will bring significant returns. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I agree this product is valuable, $800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. This price still reflects the product's value, but I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",750000.0,Alice,3,
