"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking $180 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice first. $180 is way too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering, Alice! That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still well below our maximum budget and leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that we're serious about buying but need a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget, but $80 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $130 is still more than we want to spend, especially knowing John will sell it for $100. Let's try to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $100? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

We're meeting John's price with this offer. This puts the pressure on Alice.  She needs to decide if it's worth making the sale at this price or risk losing the deal altogether."
