"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  He should counteroffer Alice to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  It's my top price, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to sell for $9,000. It's still a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still get the product for $8,000 from John.  It's better to continue negotiating with Alice and see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $8,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  How about $9,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice is not budging much from her price and the negotiation is becoming lengthy.  It's best to secure the product for his target price now, rather than risk Alice sticking to her higher price or the negotiation dragging on further."
