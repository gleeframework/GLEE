Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a higher price than John is willing to pay, but it gives me a chance to earn more. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a risk that Bob will reject the offer, the potential reward of earning an extra $300,000 outweighs the risk in my opinion. 
* **Unknown Value to Bob:** I don't know how much the product is worth to Bob. He might be willing to pay a higher price than John, or he might only be willing to pay the minimum.  A higher offer gives me a chance to capitalize on that potential.
* **Worst Case Scenario:** If Bob rejects the offer, I still have John as a backup buyer, guaranteeing me a profit of $1,200,000.

This strategy is a balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
