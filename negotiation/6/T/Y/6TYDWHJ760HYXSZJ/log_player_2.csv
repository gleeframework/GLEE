Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1000000 is simply too low for a product with the potential of this one.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1375000 is still significantly lower than the value I've placed on this product. It has a lot of potential for your business, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. Let's split the difference and meet at $1550000. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?
