Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is far too low for the value I place on the product. I'm confident I can get a better price, even if it takes a few more rounds of negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for a product with the potential of this one. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,750,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $1,375,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low for the product's true value. I believe I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,375,000 is still significantly lower than the value I've placed on this product. It has a lot of potential for your business, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. Let's split the difference and meet at $1,550,000. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product has potential, but I'm still not convinced it's worth the high price you're asking. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be more cautious. How about $1312500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,312,500.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm running out of time and John's offer is a safe bet.  I'm not willing to risk going lower and potentially ending up with a deal that's not worth it."
