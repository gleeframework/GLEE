Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a limited-time offer."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting at $925,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying significantly above your minimum price.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The phrase ""limited-time offer"" adds a touch of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **John as Backup:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, so there's less risk in starting with a higher offer to Bob."
