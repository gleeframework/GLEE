"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm eager to work with you, $1600000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1650000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1650000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1580000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1580000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  $1580000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1615000.  That's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.",1615000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1615000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1570000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal. Can we meet in the middle again?",1570000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to reach an agreement.  $1570000 is simply too low for me to consider.  However, I'm willing to make one final concession.  My absolute final offer is $1590000.  If you're serious about getting this product, this is the best price you'll get.",1590000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your final concession, but I'm still not sure if $1590000 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1575000. Can you consider this one last offer?",1575000.0,Bob,8,
