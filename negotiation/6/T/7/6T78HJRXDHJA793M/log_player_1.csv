Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. Let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts. He saves $100,000 from his perceived value, and you earn $400,000 more than your minimum.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  By mentioning other interested parties and a limited-time offer, you introduce a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially influencing Bob to make a quicker decision."
