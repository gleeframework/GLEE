"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product for $9,500. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer of $9,000 is still a better price than John's offer of $10,000. While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk Alice could reject further counteroffers and Bob would have to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer at $9,000 is the most financially sensible decision."
