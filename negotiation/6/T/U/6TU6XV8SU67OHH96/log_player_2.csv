Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my budget, I'm still willing to negotiate further. I'll make another counteroffer."

I've already compromised a lot by coming down to $155, and I'm not willing to go any lower.

Alice's final offer is still above my budget. Even though it's close, I'm not willing to go that high. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $120."
