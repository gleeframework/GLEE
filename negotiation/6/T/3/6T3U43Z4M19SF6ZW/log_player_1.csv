Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great product for $115. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal!"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to aim for a higher profit margin. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves room for Bob to potentially counteroffer, allowing for a potential compromise that still lands above my minimum acceptable price ($100).
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware that I have John as a backup buyer at $100,  which gives me leverage in the negotiation. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($100) and his own perceived value ($120). Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for me. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially knowing I have John as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $90 is too low for me. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've moved closer to the middle ground between my initial offer ($115) and Bob's counteroffer ($90).
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the value proposition of the product to remind Bob why it's worth more than his initial offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price point ($105) is still comfortably above my minimum ($100) and provides room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $105. How about we meet at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but it's clear he's unwilling to reach my minimum price of $100.  While I might be able to negotiate him up a little more, it's unlikely to be a significant jump.  Selling to John at $100 is a guaranteed profit and avoids the risk of further drawn-out negotiations with Bob."
