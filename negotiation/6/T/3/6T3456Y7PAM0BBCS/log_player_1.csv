"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me some room to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still within my acceptable range. Hopefully, this will entice him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I've already rejected two of Bob's offers, and we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $115 is a good deal considering John's offer. It's above my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
