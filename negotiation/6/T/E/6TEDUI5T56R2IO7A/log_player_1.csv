"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'll love it. My starting price is $180, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, but I'm leaving room for negotiation.  This should give Bob a sense that I'm serious about selling but am willing to compromise.  It also sets a high baseline for our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away. I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $180 was a bit high.  I'm willing to come down to $150, but that's my absolute lowest.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway by reducing the price by $30, but still keeping it above my minimum.  I'm indicating that I'm serious about negotiating, but not willing to go too low at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $150 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to accept it. I'm hoping to squeeze a bit more out of Bob and see if he's willing to go higher.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140 as a final compromise.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm making a final compromise by lowering my price to $140. I'm hoping that this will be enough to convince Bob to buy the product.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the deal for Bob and reminding him that this is my final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135, but that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is close to my minimum acceptable price and we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds. Accepting his offer secures a sale and is a good outcome considering my fallback option of $120 from John."
