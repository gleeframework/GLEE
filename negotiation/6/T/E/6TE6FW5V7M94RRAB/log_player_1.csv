{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $14,000, which is close to the midpoint between my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate while still leaving Bob with a good deal.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and conversational tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Open to Counteroffers:** My message implies that I'm open to counteroffers, signaling to Bob that there's room for negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great!  I've successfully sold the product.
* If Bob rejects:  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth pursuing or if I should move on to John for the guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  While $12,500 is above my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer of $14,000.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Exploring Higher Options:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer of $14,000,  potentially offering a compromise like $13,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interest.  $12,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  Would you consider $13,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise price of $13,500, which is closer to Bob's offer but still gives me a reasonable profit.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value proposition for Bob by stating ""It's still a good deal for you.""
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and accommodating tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've successfully negotiated a good price.
* If Bob rejects:  I'll need to assess the situation carefully.  If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I might decide to sell to John for $12,000 to guarantee a sale."
