"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a truly exceptional item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its worth to me. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  The product sounds interesting, but $950000 is a bit high for my initial budget.  I'm willing to pay $700000, given the potential for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have to say that $700000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. How about we compromise at $825000? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825000 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched at that price.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $775000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it would ensure we close this transaction without further delay.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $775000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we try $820000? I'm willing to give you a slight discount from my previous offer, but I still need to make sure I'm covering my costs. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",820000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're willing to compromise.  $820000 is getting closer, but I'm still at my limit with my budget.  To make this deal happen, I'm willing to go up to $790000. This is my final offer. It's a fair price for both of us and ensures we close this transaction efficiently.",790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not ready to accept $790000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's value. How about we try $815000? I'm giving you a slight discount from my previous offer, but I still need to make sure I'm covering my costs. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one more time.",815000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $815000 is a good price, but I'm still a bit over my budget. To make this happen, I'm willing to go to $800000. This is my absolute final offer.  We're both close to reaching a deal, and I'm confident this price is fair for both of us. It ensures a quick and mutually beneficial transaction.",800000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to accept $800000. I think we've been over this price before, and I'm starting to think we're just going around in circles. I'm willing to make one last offer, and I'm going to try to meet you at $810000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",810000.0,Alice,9,
