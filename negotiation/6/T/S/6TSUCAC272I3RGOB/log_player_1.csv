I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This gives me a good margin above my minimum acceptable price of $100, but it's also reasonable enough that Bob might be willing to pay it, especially if he values the product highly. 

If he rejects, I can always sell it to John for $100, so I have nothing to lose by trying to get a higher price."
