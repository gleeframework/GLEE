{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs and can bring significant value to your business.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I value the product at. I'm going to see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still too far below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000,  which reflects both the value of the product and your  interest in acquiring it. Let's find a middle ground so we can both be satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,200,000, which would be $1,150,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,150,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a few more rounds, but if I don't get a better offer soon, I will likely sell the product to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us to both benefit from this transaction. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1175000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,175,000, which would be $1,162,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,162,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,162,500

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now, and while he's willing to pay more than his initial offer, we're still not close to a price that works for me.  I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk ending up with a price that's too low.  I'm going to take John's offer of $1,500,000. It's a guaranteed sale, and it's the best price I've been offered so far."
