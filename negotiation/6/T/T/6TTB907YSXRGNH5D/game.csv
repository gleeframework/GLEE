"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $100 for it, what do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It sounds like a great product.  However, $100 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $80? ",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $90?  It's a fair price that still gives you a good deal.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $85. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",85.0,Bob,4,
