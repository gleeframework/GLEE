"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will bring you significant returns. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product has value, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. How about $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still leaving a lot of potential profit on the table. We'll continue negotiating firmly to see if we can get closer to our desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a number that works for both of us.  Would you consider $1,250,000?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're splitting the difference again to show a willingness to compromise while still staying above the halfway point between our initial offer and his. This keeps the negotiation moving and maintains a firm but fair stance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm getting closer to a deal, but I still think we can do better. How about $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to lowball at this point. While he's inching upwards, the increments are getting smaller. We need to signal that our price is firming up. We'll make one more counteroffer close to our acceptable range, then consider selling to John if Bob doesn't bite."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're having this conversation, but I need to be upfront.  $1,225,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go.  This product has significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on that investment.  Let me know if you're ready to move forward."",
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This offer makes it clear that we're reaching our bottom line while still offering a price that provides substantial profit for both parties. We're giving Bob a final chance to make a deal before we entertain selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product has significant value, but I'm not willing to go above $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. How about we stick with $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has stalled out.  He is unwilling to move significantly from his $1,150,000 offer. We've been firm with our lower limit of $1,225,000. At this point, the remaining profit potential with Bob isn't worth the risk of him walking away, costing us a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. It's time to move on and take the safe deal."
