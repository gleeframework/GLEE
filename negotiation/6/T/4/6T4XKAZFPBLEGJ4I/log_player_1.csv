Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential interest.  I'll be ready to negotiate if he rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $80 is unacceptable. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}

I'm lowering my price to $125, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I want. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price to $110. This is my final counteroffer before I consider selling to John. Hopefully, Bob will find this acceptable."
