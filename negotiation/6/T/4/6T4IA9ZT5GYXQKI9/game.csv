"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to consider $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $150, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $140. This is a fair price for both of us and it's a good deal for you given the quality of the product.",140.0,Alice,5,
