,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid I can't meet you at $100. I'm willing to come down to $110, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Would you be willing to meet me at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $105. How about $107.50? I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",107.5,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I'm getting close, but I'm still not convinced. I'd be willing to meet you at $105 again, but I'm willing to throw in a small concession. How about $105 and I'll also take an additional accessory that's worth $10? Would you consider that?",105.0,Bob,6,,10.0
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate the additional accessory, Bob, but I'm still not willing to meet you at $105. I'm willing to throw in the accessory myself, but I need to make up for the value of the product. How about $115, and I'll include the accessory for free?",115.0,Alice,7,,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to meet you at $112.50, and I'll take the accessory for free. Can you consider that?",112.5,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to come down to $113, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price for the product and the accessory",113.0,Alice,9,,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer,
"I'm really close to walking away, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $112, but that's my final offer. If you can't meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $150.",112.0,Bob,10,,
