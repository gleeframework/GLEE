"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. I think this is a great price considering its value to you is $800,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $975,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to me is $1,200,000.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its value to me is $1,200,000.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $925,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I'm confident we can close the deal at this price, as it's a fair compromise for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,6,
