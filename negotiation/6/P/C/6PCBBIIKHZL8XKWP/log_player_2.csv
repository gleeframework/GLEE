Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good initial discount. I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I'm confident that $1,200,000 is still a good value for me, considering my $1,500,000 budget and Alice's $1,000,000 valuation."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

**Reasoning:**  Alice's last offer was $1,350,000.  My counteroffer of $1,300,000 splits the difference, showing willingness to compromise while still trying to save some money.  This is a good middle ground for the next round."
