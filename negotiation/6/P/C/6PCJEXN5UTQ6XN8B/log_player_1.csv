Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. I'm asking for $1,400,000, which reflects its true worth.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This makes Bob perceive any subsequent negotiation as a potential ""deal.""
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message subtly highlights the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small margin for negotiation if Bob attempts to haggle.
* **Backup Plan Security:**  You're secure knowing John will purchase the product for your minimum acceptable price. This allows for a bolder opening offer to Bob."
