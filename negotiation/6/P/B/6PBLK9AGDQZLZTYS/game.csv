"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your proposal, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,100,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,100,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price point. Would you consider $1,130,000? This allows us both to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1130000.0,Alice,3,
