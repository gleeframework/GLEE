"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above your maximum willingness to pay and significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. 
* By rejecting this offer, you have a chance of getting a better deal, either from Alice in a counter-offer or by purchasing from John."
