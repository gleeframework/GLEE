Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, meaning he'd theoretically be willing to pay anything up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly closer to Bob's maximum valuation. 
* **Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to accept the offer quickly."
