"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $500,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $1,300,000.  This is a fairer offer reflecting the value this product holds.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I believe the product is good, $1,300,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This feels like a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
