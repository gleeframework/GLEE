"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to further discussion and willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to offer $950,000.  I'm hoping we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. Considering the value of the product to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive from the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,150,000. This price is closer to the value I've set for the product, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to maintain a certain level of profit. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
