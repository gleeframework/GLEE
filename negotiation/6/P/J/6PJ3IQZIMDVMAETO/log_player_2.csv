"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her own valuation of the product, so there's room for negotiation. You should try to get a better price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,350,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,400,000 is still within your budget and closer to your desired price than John's offer of $1,500,000.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice might reject your next offer or that you might end up paying more with John.  Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product within your budget and avoid further negotiations."
