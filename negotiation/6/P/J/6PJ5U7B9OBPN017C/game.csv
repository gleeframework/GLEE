"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $20,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. Could you consider $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $17,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. $13,500 is still quite a bit below what I had in mind. How about we settle at $16,000?  That's a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position but $16,000 is pushing my limit.  I can do $14,000, which is a fair offer considering John is offering a similar deal. ",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you continuing this negotiation and your willingness to find a price that works for both of us.  While John's offer is tempting, I believe you see the true value in this product.  Let's close this out, how about $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, thanks for recognizing the value I place in this. It's clear we both want this deal done. How about we split the difference and close this out at $14,750?",14750.0,Bob,8,
