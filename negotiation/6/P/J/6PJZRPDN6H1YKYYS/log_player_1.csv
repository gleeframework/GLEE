Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. I'd be willing to meet you at $950,000. That's the highest I can go, considering my budget constraints.

We're still significantly above John's offer. Let's see if we can push Bob a little further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm not willing to go above $925,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

While we could continue negotiating, Bob's offer of $925,000 is still a significant profit above John's $800,000.  It's unlikely Bob will move much higher, and there's always the risk of him walking away altogether. Accepting now secures a good deal."
