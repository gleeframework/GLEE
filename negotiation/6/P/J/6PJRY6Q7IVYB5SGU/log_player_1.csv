"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that I can always come down if necessary. By offering $900,000, I'm leaving room for negotiation and showing that I'm serious about getting the best possible price. I'm also trying to gauge Bob's interest level by his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a fairer agreement. Considering the product's value to me, I would like to propose a price of $750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give away the product for less than what it's worth to me. I'll counter his offer with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. How about we settle on $850,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I've given this some thought and I believe we can find common ground. I would like to suggest a price of $825,000. This is higher than my previous offer but still lower than your initial proposal. I hope this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. It's a good deal considering the value of the product to him, and it's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and potential complications."
