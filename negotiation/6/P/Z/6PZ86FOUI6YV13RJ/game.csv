"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Could you do $17,000? That would make it worthwhile for me.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $14,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
