"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $100 by you. I am proposing to sell it to you for $90. This is an excellent opportunity to acquire a valuable item at a discounted price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer of $90 is less than your maximum budget of $100, and it's a better deal than buying from John for $100."
