"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $120 is way below my minimum. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $120 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still a bit too low. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm also trying to get a fair price for my product. Let's meet at $135. This is my final offer, and I think it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $125, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum. While I'm disappointed we couldn't reach an agreement, I'm not willing to go any lower. Selling to John for $150 ensures I get a price that is fair to me."
