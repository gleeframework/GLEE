"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $100 at this time.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This still leaves me with a fair profit, and it's a good price for the value you'll get.  What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
