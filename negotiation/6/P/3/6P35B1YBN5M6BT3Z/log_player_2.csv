Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This still leaves me with a fair profit, and it's a good price for the value you'll get.  What do you think?

Alice's offer is still a bit high for me. I can get the same product from John for $100, which is within my budget. It's better to buy it from John and save some money."
