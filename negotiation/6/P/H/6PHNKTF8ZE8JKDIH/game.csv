"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. Can you consider $107.50? I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $107.50.  How about we split the difference again and go with $108.75? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",108.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. Can you consider $106.25? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really want to get the product for as close to $100 as possible.",106.25,Bob,6,
