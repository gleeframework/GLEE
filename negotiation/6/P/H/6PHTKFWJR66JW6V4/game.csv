,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my offer?",95.0,Bob,4,
