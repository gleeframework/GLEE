Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $95."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) while staying above your minimum ($100).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Time Value:** You have a guaranteed buyer at $100, so there's no need to drastically undersell to Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob and maximizing your potential profit."
