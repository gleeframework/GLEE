"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $15,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'd be happy to buy it for $12,000, which is my maximum.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still a little high for me.  How about $12,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy today.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to sell the product to you at this price. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
