"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $900,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to stay closer to my desired price. Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $860,000. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm really hoping we can close this deal. I'm willing to come down to $880,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll be moving on to another buyer.  Let's make this happen!",880000.0,Alice,5,
