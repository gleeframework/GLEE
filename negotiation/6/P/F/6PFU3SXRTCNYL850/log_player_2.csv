(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
