"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However, $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not under pressure to accept it yet. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9000.  I'm still a little hesitant at that price.  I'm willing to go up to $8500.  This is a fair compromise for both of us, and allows us to close the deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price and allows me to make a fair profit. Accepting this offer is a good choice as I don't want to risk him walking away and I have a guaranteed buyer in John for $8,000."
