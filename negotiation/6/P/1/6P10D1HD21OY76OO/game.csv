"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However, $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is a bit low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9000.  I'm still a little hesitant at that price.  I'm willing to go up to $8500.  This is a fair compromise for both of us, and allows us to close the deal.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,4,
