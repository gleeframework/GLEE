{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very useful. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's higher than Bob's value for the product but still attractive enough to encourage negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get a higher price.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about $135?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $132.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely that further negotiation will only lead to more back and forth. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
