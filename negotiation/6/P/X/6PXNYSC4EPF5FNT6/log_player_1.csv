"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 150} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($120) and to Bob ($120) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a friendly and positive tone can help build rapport and make Bob more inclined to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning the product's value or benefits can make Bob more likely to accept the offer.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is too low to consider. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a great price for this product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and positive tone to keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is still a good deal even at the counteroffer price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $115 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I could try to negotiate further,  the risk of him rejecting and the possibility of losing the deal to John make accepting his offer the best option in this round."
