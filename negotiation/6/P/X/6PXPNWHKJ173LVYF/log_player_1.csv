Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for a steal at $14,000.  It's a fantastic deal on something I know you'll appreciate."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, getting Bob to buy it at $14,000 still nets us a $2,000 profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 is a strong starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but significantly below our backup offer ($15,000).
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the ""deal"" and ""steal"" aspect to entice Bob. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still ensuring the sale of the product."
