"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
