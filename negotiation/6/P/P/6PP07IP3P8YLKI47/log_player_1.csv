{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm also optimistic and positive in my message to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $9,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking maybe we could meet at $8,500? I'm really interested in the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I've already negotiated a bit and it seems Bob is firmly set on his price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $10,000, ensuring I reach my minimum goal."
