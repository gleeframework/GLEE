Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $175.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation or for Bob to accept outright if he values the product more than you anticipate.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While we know Bob values the product at $100, the offer aims to create the perception of value exceeding that.
* **Below John's Offer:**  The offer is still attractive compared to selling it to John for $150. This gives Bob an incentive to consider the offer seriously. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. If Bob rejects it, there's still room to negotiate a price closer to $150 before resorting to selling to John."
