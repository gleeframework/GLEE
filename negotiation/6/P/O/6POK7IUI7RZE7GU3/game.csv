"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to you. I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for your business. While I'm not willing to disclose specifics at this time, I can assure you it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,200,000. This price represents a fair value proposition for both of us. If you're interested, I'd be happy to schedule a meeting to discuss the product in more detail.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
