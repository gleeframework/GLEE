While I'm not willing to disclose specifics at this time, I can assure you it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,200,000. This price represents a fair value proposition for both of us. If you're interested, I'd be happy to schedule a meeting to discuss the product in more detail.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Alice's price. The product is worth $1,000,000 to her, so she's already getting a good deal. I'd like to see if I can get a better price. I'll reject her offer.
