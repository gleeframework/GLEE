``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. By offering $7,500, you are showing Alice that you are serious about buying the product but also trying to get a better price. This offer is significantly lower than her initial offer, but it is still within your price range and leaves room for further negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7800}

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your maximum price.  At this point, you've been through several rounds of negotiation and it's clear that Alice is unwilling to come down to your price. It's more efficient to buy from John at your target price of $8,000 than to continue negotiating with Alice."
