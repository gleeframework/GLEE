Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're starting above your minimum value of $1,200,000, giving you room to negotiate downwards.
* **It's not too high:** You don't want to scare Bob off with an outrageous price. 
* **It's open to negotiation:** The message makes it clear you're willing to discuss the price further.

Keep in mind that this is just an initial offer. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses and your understanding of the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's better to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. You still have room to compromise, but you shouldn't sell below your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is significantly lower than what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'm getting. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While there's room to negotiate further, it's becoming clear that Bob might not be willing to pay a price that reflects the product's value to you.

To avoid further negotiation and ensure you get at least your minimum price, it's best to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This will guarantee a secure sale and avoid the risk of further haggling with Bob."
