"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800000 to you. Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $750000 for it.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $750000 is significantly below what I'm hoping to get. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $900000? This still leaves room for you to profit, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $850000.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 still doesn't quite work for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $875000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $825000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but $825000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $850000. This is a good compromise for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit firm on my price. I'd be willing to meet you at $825000, but I'm not going any higher.",825000.0,Bob,8,
