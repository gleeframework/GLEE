"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $750000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $750,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $750,000 is significantly below what I'm hoping to get. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $900,000? This still leaves room for you to profit, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $850000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get more, especially with the option to sell to John for $1,200,000. I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 still doesn't quite work for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $825000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure with only four rounds left, $825,000 is still too low for me. I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher.  Plus, John is always a backup option at $1,200,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but $825,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $850,000. This is a good compromise for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit firm on my price. I'd be willing to meet you at $825000, but I'm not going any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. It's clear Bob is unwilling to budge beyond $825,000, and with only two rounds remaining, I'm not confident I can push him any higher. Selling to John guarantees me a much better deal, even though I would have preferred to close the deal with Bob."
