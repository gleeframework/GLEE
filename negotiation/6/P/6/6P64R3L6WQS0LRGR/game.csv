"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000?  That's my absolute top price for this product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
