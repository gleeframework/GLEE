"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would you consider lowering the price?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $100? That's still a significant discount from my original price and would be a fair compromise.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and while I appreciate your flexibility, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to reach an agreement at $92? This would allow us to find a balance between our expectations.",92.0,Bob,6,
