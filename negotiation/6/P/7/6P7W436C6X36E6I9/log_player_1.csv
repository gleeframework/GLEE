Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:**  Starting at $19,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) and your minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Creating a sense of scarcity and opportunity:** Mentioning ""interest"" and offering it to Bob before a public listing creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially making him more inclined to accept a higher price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The message invites Bob's thoughts, implying a willingness to negotiate. This gives you flexibility if Bob counters with a lower offer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's negotiation style:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator or particularly price-sensitive, you might adjust the initial offer slightly lower. 
* **Time sensitivity:**  If you need to sell the product quickly, you might consider a lower initial offer to increase the likelihood of a faster sale."
