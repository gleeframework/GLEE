{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $140.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **John's Offer:** John provides a safety net, ensuring you'll at least get $100.

By offering the product at $140, you're aiming for a price close to Bob's maximum valuation while still securing a significant profit. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but keeps you well above your minimum acceptable price."
