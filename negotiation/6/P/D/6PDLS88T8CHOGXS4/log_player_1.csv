Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, as it's worth much more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum price of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob still gets a good deal, as the product is worth $120 to him. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust the price if Bob counteroffers. 

By starting at $100, you set a reasonable expectation and give Bob an incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $100 is a bit high for me. How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $90 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum of $80, and it's likely that further negotiation with Bob might not lead to a significantly better price.  There's also a chance that Bob could walk away, and then I'd only have the option to sell to John for $80."
