Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's fair given its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's a bit lower than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also a good starting point to see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay closer to my minimum price. How about $10,500? This gives us both some room to maneuver."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my minimum price of $15,000, Bob's offer of $10,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant improvement over his previous offer, and it's above my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of Bob walking away entirely."
