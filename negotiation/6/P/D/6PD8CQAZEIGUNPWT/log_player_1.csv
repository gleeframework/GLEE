Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is high but still potentially attractive to Bob.  It's above his perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  It also positions me to make a few concessions if necessary before ultimately falling back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but $12,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm willing to compromise a bit from my initial offer, but $13,000 is still a good deal for Bob considering he values the product at $8,000. This counteroffer shows flexibility while still maintaining a significant profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and it's clear he's not willing to meet me halfway.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to a sure thing with John.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is well above my minimum."
