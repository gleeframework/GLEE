"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $900000 is unfortunately a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000, which is a fair price considering my needs. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $850000, which is still a great value considering the product's worth to you. I believe this is a fair middle ground. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850000 is still a bit high for me. However, I'm willing to go up to $825000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's find a way to make this work.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $875000. This is still a great value for the product, and I believe it's worth considering. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current offers. Would you be willing to meet me at $812500?",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find common ground.  While $875000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our last two offers.  Would you consider $800000?  This is my final offer, and it reflects the true value of the product for me. Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $800000 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to accept it. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $815000, which is still a great value for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. Let's try to find a way to make this work.",815000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to compromise.  While $815000 is getting closer, I'm still not able to go above $800000.  I understand this is a significant asset for you, but it's also important for me to stay within my budget.  If you're truly serious about selling, I'm confident this price will be mutually beneficial.  I'm ready to close the deal at $800000.",800000.0,Bob,8,
