"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.  Please let me know if you're interested. If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for a higher price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than its value to her, it's more than your maximum budget and more importantly, more expensive than John's offer. You can get a better deal from John."
