"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible.  I'm going to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $9,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering a price higher than my maximum budget ($10,000). While she has come down a bit, I'm going to continue trying to negotiate a lower price.  I'm also aware that I can buy the product from John for $10,000, giving me a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm firm on $10,000.  That's the absolute most I can pay, and it would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I've already compromised a lot. I'm willing to make one more move, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, but her offer is still above my maximum budget.  I'm going to stick to my counteroffer of $10,000 and see if she'll budge. It's important to remember that I can always buy the product from John for $10,000 if negotiations with Alice fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too much. I've already made my best offer at $10,000, and I'm not able to go any higher. It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
