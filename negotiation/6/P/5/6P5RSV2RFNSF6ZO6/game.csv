"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $9,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm firm on $10,000.  That's the absolute most I can pay, and it would be a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I've already compromised a lot. I'm willing to make one more move, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $10,500, but that's as low as I can go.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too much. I've already made my best offer at $10,000, and I'm not able to go any higher. It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.  What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,6,
