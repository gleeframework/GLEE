Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum value. 
* **Appealing to value:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get from the product.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** There's space for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a potential middle ground. 

This approach balances the need to earn as much as possible while also leaving room for negotiation and a potential successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Is this something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value.**  While it's closer to my minimum than his initial offer, it's still not worth it for me to sell at that price.
* **I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal.
* **Selling to John is still an option.** If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, which is my fallback plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. While $9000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $11,000 to make this deal work.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,000?  I believe this price still represents great value for you, and I'm flexible on the final number."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price.
* **Remaining above my minimum:**  $10,000 is still above my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Framing it as a win-win:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob would get at this price and suggesting it's a good deal for both of us.
* **Keeping the door open:** I'm open to negotiation and implying flexibility to potentially reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9500 for the product. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $500 below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **No guarantee of a better offer:**  There's no guarantee that I can get a better offer from Bob in future rounds. He might walk away altogether.
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I can still sell to John for $15,000, but I'd be losing potential profit.

Given the risk of losing a deal altogether and the relatively small difference between Bob's offer and my minimum, accepting his offer seems like the most sensible choice at this point."
