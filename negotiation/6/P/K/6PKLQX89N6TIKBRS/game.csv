"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90 for the product?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? This is a fair price that benefits both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92.50 for the product. Can you consider this price?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $92.50 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for something a bit higher. How about we settle on $94? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.",94.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm starting to get close to my budget, but $94 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's my final offer. Can you consider this price?",92.0,Bob,6,
