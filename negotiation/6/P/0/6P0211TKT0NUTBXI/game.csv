"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way too high for me.  This product is useful to me, but not at that price. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the product's inherent worth and potential benefits warrant a higher price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm willing to spend.  I can go as high as $900,000, but that's my absolute limit.",900000.0,Bob,4,
