"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18000 for the product.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $16000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I'm looking to get from the sale.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $16000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $12000.  I think this is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $12000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far apart from that price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to meet a minimum of $14000 to make this sale worthwhile for me. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from there.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $14000 is still pushing my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one and offer $13000.  This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to make a deal we're happy with.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $15000. Let's try $14500. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",14500.0,Alice,7,
