Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, and it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us.

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's clear he's trying to get a significant discount. I have a guaranteed offer for $1,000,000 from John, and it's not worth the risk of Bob lowballing further or the time to continue negotiating."
