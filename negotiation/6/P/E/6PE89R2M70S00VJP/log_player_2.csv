"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase something truly valuable. I believe it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and to demonstrate its potential, I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than the product's worth to Bob.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, and it's a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a significant reduction from her initial offer, it's still above the $1,000,000 value Bob places on the product. Bob has already established his willingness to pay $800,000, so it's reasonable to reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating to try and get closer to that price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
