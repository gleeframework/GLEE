"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly valuable. I believe it's worth more than its face value of $150, but let's start our discussion here. How about we aim for a price that reflects its true worth? What do you think would be a fair price for you?",200.0,Alice,1,,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your offer. Given the unique value and quality of our product, I believe it deserves a bit more recognition. Would you consider a price closer to its true value, perhaps $140? This would still be a significant discount compared to its face value, while ensuring both parties benefit.",140.0,Alice,3,,
