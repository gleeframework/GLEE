Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is higher than Bob's estimated value of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing fairness and leaving the door open for discussion.  
* **Plan:** My strategy is to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to my desired price point. If he rejects, I'll use his counteroffer to gauge his willingness to pay and make further counteroffers.  However, I'm always prepared to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price of $1,200,000 if negotiations don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While $900,000 is closer to my desired price point, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Next Steps:** I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating.  I'll likely make a counteroffer somewhere between $900,000 and $1,200,000, trying to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Always Ready to Walk Away:** I'm still prepared to sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob become unproductive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. It's a fair price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $950,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Message:** I reiterate the value of the product and try to appeal to Bob's sense of a ""fair"" deal.
* **Plan:** I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept. If he rejects it, I'll have to re-evaluate my options: further counteroffers, or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer of $925,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **No Further Room for Negotiation:** Bob has stated this is his final offer.  I'm not willing to compromise further and risk getting stuck with a price significantly below my target.
* **Selling to John is the Best Choice:** Selling the product to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price. It's the safest and most profitable option at this point."
