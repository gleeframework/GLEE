"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Bob,  accepting Alice's offer for $9,500 would be a loss. It's better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to consider $8,500? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $9,000? I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product and the savings you'll enjoy. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum. He can continue negotiating in hopes of getting a lower offer.  Bob has 7 rounds left, and  he can always buy from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $9,000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that. However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget, but he wants to save as much as possible. He's already rejected several offers from Alice. Since he has several rounds remaining and the option to buy from John for $8,000,  he should continue to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $8,800. This represents a significant step closer to your asking price, and I'm confident we can close this deal with this price."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to come down to $9,100. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has only 3 rounds remaining. Alice's offer is still above his desired price.  While there's a chance he could negotiate further, the risk of not reaching a deal in the limited rounds and ending up with no product is high.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product from John for $8,000 and avoid any further risk."
