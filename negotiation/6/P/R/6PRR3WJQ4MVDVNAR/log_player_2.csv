"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $950000. This is an exceptional deal, considering its worth to me is no less than $1000000. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your life or business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'm interested in the product, but I'm not sure if the price is right. Since Alice values the product at $1,000,000 or more, I'm not sure if I can trust that she's selling it for a good deal. I'd rather buy it from John for $1,500,000, as I know that's the maximum I'm willing to pay.
