Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $950,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 but still above Bob's value of $800,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation without sacrificing too much profit.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and highlights the potential benefit for both parties. 
* **John as Backup:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall through.

This strategy aims to find a compromise while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $875,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's a step up from his initial value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I can make a counteroffer that's more in line with my desired price.
* **John as a safety net:**  The option to sell to John for $1,000,000 is still available if the negotiation with Bob fails. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I can try to secure a higher price while keeping John as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for both of us to be happy.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a counteroffer of $925,000, which is a significant decrease from my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Focus on value and compromise:**  I reiterate the value of the product and highlight the potential for both of us to find a happy middle ground. 
* **Staying above minimum:** My counteroffer is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose out on profit.

This strategy aims to find a compromise that is acceptable to both parties while keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the possibility of selling to John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. I am willing to consider $900,000 for the product. This amount aligns more closely with my valuation of the item while still leaving some room for negotiation. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While it's not ideal, there's still potential to negotiate a slightly higher price in the next round. 
* **Risk of losing a deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I might be forced to sell to John at a lower price. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing the negotiation could drag on, and I might not be able to get a significantly better deal.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and allows me to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price in the next round. This strategy balances maximizing profit with the need to reach a deal before time runs out."
