"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $12,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is what it's worth to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $12,000 is still my ideal target. How about we meet halfway at $10,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,000, but I'm still stuck at $8,000. This is what the product is worth to me, and I'm not comfortable going higher. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to go with another seller.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about this: $9,000, and that's my final offer. It's a strong price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. My final offer is $8,500.  If we can't meet in the middle, I'll have to go with another seller.",8500.0,Bob,6,
