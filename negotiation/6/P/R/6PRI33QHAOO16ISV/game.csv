"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my price range.  Would you consider $90?  It's my best offer, and I'm ready to buy if we can agree.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the value. Let's make this deal!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $95. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can agree.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's finalize this deal!",100.0,Alice,5,
