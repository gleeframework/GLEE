"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite there yet.  While I acknowledge the market value you mentioned, this product has unique features that I believe justify a higher price.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This represents a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
