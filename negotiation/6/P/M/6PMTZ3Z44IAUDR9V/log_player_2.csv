{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:**  $950,000
* **Your maximum value:** $1,000,000
* **John's offer:** $1,000,000

Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll pay $1,000,000 to John. This is still within your budget and saves you $50,000 compared to accepting Alice's offer."
