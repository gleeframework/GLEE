{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum. This allows room for negotiation while still leaving you with a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less to me than that. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000.  This price reflects the value of the product while still giving you a good deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not budging much on his price, and while $1,080,000 is better than his initial offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to take the safe route and sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  It's a guaranteed profit and avoids any further negotiation."
