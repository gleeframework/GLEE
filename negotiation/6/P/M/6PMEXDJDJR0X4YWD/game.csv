"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. However, I am interested in discussing a potential price that might be within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate down to $7500?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8250. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,

After evaluating the value of the product and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $8000.
