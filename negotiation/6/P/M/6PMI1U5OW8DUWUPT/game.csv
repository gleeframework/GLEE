"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I still think the product's value is higher than your offer. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1325000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's unique features and rarity. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
