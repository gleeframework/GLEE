Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes the value and deal for Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A $12,000 offer leaves space for Bob to counter without making me feel pressured to immediately sell to John. 

I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually agreeable price, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $15,000 I can get from John.
* **Room for Counteroffer:** I can still counteroffer Bob and potentially get a better price. There's still room for negotiation within my acceptable range.
* **Avoiding the ""Sell-to-John"" trap:**  While $15,000 is the best-case scenario, it's important to consider that John is a potential ""escape route."" Selling to John too quickly might limit my chances of getting a higher price from Bob. 

I want to explore further negotiation with Bob before resorting to John, as I believe there's a good chance of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price that allows me to cover my costs and still gives you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying within my acceptable range.
* **Highlighting Fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair"" price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Remaining Flexible:**  I'm still open to further negotiation but am signaling that I'm not willing to go much lower than $10,500.

This counteroffer keeps me in a strong negotiating position while also giving Bob a reasonable opportunity to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to go down to $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $9,500 is still below the $15,000 I could get from John.
* **Room for one more counteroffer:** I can still make one more counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price. This is my last chance before selling to John.
* **Avoiding the ""Sell-to-John"" trap:** While selling to John would secure me my minimum, I want to exhaust all options with Bob first. It's possible he'll come up a bit more with one more round of negotiation. 

I'm going to counteroffer Bob one last time, but if he rejects that, I'll sell to John to guarantee my minimum profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I understand you're trying to get the best price.  However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer you the product for $10,000.  This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the value you'll receive.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm signaling this is my last counteroffer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob. 
* **Bottom Line:** I clearly state this is my absolute lowest price, making it harder for Bob to negotiate further.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I remind Bob of the value he'll receive, aiming to sway him towards accepting the offer.

This counteroffer is a calculated risk, hoping Bob will accept to avoid further negotiation or the potential loss of the deal altogether.  If he rejects this, I'll move on to John and secure my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I really need this product. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250. That's the best I can do. Please let me know if it's acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** $9,250 is still below my minimum price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Exhausted:** I've already made several counteroffers and Bob is clearly unwilling to budge much further.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit, and I don't want to risk losing out on that. 

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his latest offer is too low. I'm going to sell to John and ensure I get the best possible price for my product."
