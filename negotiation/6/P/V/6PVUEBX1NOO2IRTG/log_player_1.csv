I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's valuation, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while also ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to settle for that price. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105.  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure if further negotiation will yield a better result. To avoid wasting time and ensure I get my minimum price, I'll sell the product to John for $120."
