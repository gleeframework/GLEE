{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $10,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than your minimum, but it's not too high that it would immediately scare Bob away. It's also paired with a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $10000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $7500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $7,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $8,500?  That gives you a great deal and still allows me to get a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8500 is closer, but still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8000.  This feels fair to both of us and would be a great deal for me. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is now my minimum acceptable price, and it's a fair deal for both of us. I'm happy to accept his offer and close the deal."
