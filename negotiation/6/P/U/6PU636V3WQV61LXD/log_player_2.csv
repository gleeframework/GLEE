Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about buying, but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price.  It's a good starting point for negotiation."

Alice's offer is still too high.  Let's see if we can get her closer to my target price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is still above my target price, but we're getting closer.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}

I'm raising my offer again, showing I'm serious about buying and hoping to meet Alice halfway.  This is likely my last chance to make a counteroffer before going with John."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is still too high. I've had several rounds of negotiations, and it seems unlikely she'll come down to my target price. I'm better off buying from John."
