"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $150.
* Alice's offer is $140, which is still higher than your desired price.
* There's room for negotiation, so it makes sense to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I want to buy the product for as low a price as possible.
* My initial counteroffer is $130, which is $10 lower than Alice's offer of $140. 
* This seems like a reasonable starting point for negotiation, considering my value of $150 and Alice's value of $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $135, which is within my budget of $150 and closer to my desired price. 
* While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my next counteroffer and I might end up paying John's price of $150. 
* It's more advantageous to accept Alice's offer and save $15 compared to buying from John."
