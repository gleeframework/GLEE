Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's  $20 less than Bob's maximum value, but still significantly higher than my minimum.  This gives me room to negotiate while ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still willing to negotiate for a higher price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. Hopefully, this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
