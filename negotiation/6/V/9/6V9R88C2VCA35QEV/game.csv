"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a budget of $10,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget, but I can't go as low as $10,000.  I'm willing to drop my price a bit further to $10,500. This reflects the value of the product for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit too high to accept $10,300. Let's split the difference. How about $10,400? This would allow us both to reach a mutually agreeable price.",10400.0,Alice,5,
