"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth and the benefits it will bring you.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my research and understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,400,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the return on investment it offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This offer reflects my true budget and the value I see in this product. Let's find a middle ground and finalize this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
