"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $150, but Alice's offer is $120, which is more than you want to spend.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can try to get a better price by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is an option, but not ideal.** While it's an option if you fail to negotiate a better price with Alice, you'd be paying significantly more than you'd like."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting lower:** I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, aiming to create a gap for negotiation.
* **Reasonable offer:** $100 is still within my budget and leaves room for Alice to potentially make a profit. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see if she's willing to lower her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice has lowered her offer, $110 is still above my ideal price point.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate a better price, and I'm not ready to settle for $110 just yet.
* **John's offer is still too expensive:** I'm avoiding buying from John unless I have no other choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My previous offer of $100 was rejected, so I'm raising it slightly to $105, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Staying within budget:** This offer still keeps me within my budget while trying to find a middle ground.
* **Encouraging acceptance:** By offering a price closer to Alice's last offer, I'm increasing the chances of her accepting and reaching a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting close:** Alice's offer of $107 is very close to my last counteroffer of $105.
* **Time is a factor:** We're already in round 5, and I don't want to risk running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a much higher price. 
* **Small compromise:** A $2 difference is a small compromise that allows me to secure the product while staying within my budget."
