"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see how much he's willing to pay. It also gives me a starting point to adjust my price downwards in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I want to see if I can get closer to my minimum price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm offering $1,500,000, which is my minimum price.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's a good deal for both of us.  If he doesn't accept, I'm willing to sell to John, but I'd rather sell to Bob if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm running out of time, I'm not willing to accept such a low price yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm reducing my counteroffer to $1,300,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to meet Bob halfway. If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still too low. With only four rounds left, the risk of not reaching a better deal is too high. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000 to ensure I get my minimum price."
