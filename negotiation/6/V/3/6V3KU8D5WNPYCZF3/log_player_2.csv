"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting, Bob can potentially get the product for closer to his desired price of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to get it for closer to $1,000,000. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $1075000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $1,075,000, which is only $75,000 more than Bob's desired price of $1,000,000.  This is a good compromise, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better price.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option for Bob."
