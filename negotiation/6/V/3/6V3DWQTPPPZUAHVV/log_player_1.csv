"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe has tremendous value for your business. My asking price is $1,200,000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll find the return on investment to be substantial. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I've set the initial price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:**  My message is friendly and emphasizes the potential benefits for Bob. 
* **Focus on Value:** I highlight the product's value rather than focusing solely on the price.

**Strategy:** 

By starting high and emphasizing the product's value, I aim to initiate a negotiation that could lead to a price closer to my minimum desired value of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $900,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe I can secure a better price. 
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is an option, I want to see if I can push for a higher price with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price that's closer to my target. I'll use the next round to counter with a more reasonable price that may be closer to what Bob is willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit below my minimum threshold. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This price reflects the unique features and benefits of this product, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm counter-offering with $1,050,000, which is halfway between my initial offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000).
* **Reasoning:** I'm emphasizing the unique value of the product and stating it's a ""fair offer for both of us"". This helps to frame the counteroffer as a compromise.
* **Staying Firm:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum desired value of $1,000,000 but showing flexibility.

**Strategy:**

By counter-offering with a price that's closer to what Bob may be willing to pay, I'm increasing the chances of reaching an agreement.  I'm also  emphasizing the value of the product to make this price seem reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my desired value, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation:** I'm still willing to negotiate, but I believe I can secure a better price.
* **Selling to John:** Although selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue negotiating with Bob, aiming to find a price that meets my minimum requirement. There's still room for compromise, and I believe I can get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $950,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's unique value.  How about we meet at $1,000,000? This price aligns with my minimum requirements, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I believe this is a fair compromise considering the potential benefits this product can bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm counter-offering with $1,000,000, which is my minimum desired value and also a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's.
* **Reasoning:** I'm emphasizing the unique value of the product and framing the offer as a ""mutually beneficial agreement"" to make it appealing.
* **Finality:** I'm signaling this might be my final offer, making it clear that a decision needs to be made.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a clear signal that I'm willing to close the deal at my minimum price.  I've highlighted the product's value and the potential benefits for Bob, hoping to convince him to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $975,000 is still below my minimum desired value of $1,000,000.
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:** We're at a point where the difference is relatively small, but I'm not willing to risk going lower.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate could potentially result in me losing out on a guaranteed sale to John at $1,000,000. 

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, the potential of getting a better price with further negotiation is slim. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired value and avoids further risk of losing out on a sale."
