"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the transaction quickly.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
