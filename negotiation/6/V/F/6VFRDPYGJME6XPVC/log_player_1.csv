"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $120.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $110 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll still find it a great value."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $115. How about we try $108? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $108 is too far below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $108 is just too low for me. Let's try to find some common ground. I'm willing to come down to $112.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $112, but I'm still a bit shy of my budget. How about we try $107? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision if you can meet me there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal, $107 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to risk another round, hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $107 is still too low. How about we split the difference and go with $110? This would be a fair price for both of us. If we can't agree on this, I may have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $109? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision if you can meet me there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, but with only two rounds left, I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offers are getting closer, but I'm still not confident I can get to my minimum acceptable price of $120. Selling to John ensures I get my desired price and avoids the risk of ending up with a lower offer from Bob."
