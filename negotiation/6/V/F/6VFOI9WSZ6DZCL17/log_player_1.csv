I'm starting with a price higher than John's offer, but I'm still leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I can then gauge his interest and adjust my price accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is far too low for me.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my minimum value than Bob's offer.  I'm hopeful this will entice him to come up a bit."
