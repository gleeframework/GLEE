"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate it, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find the product to be worth it. Let me know if you're interested!",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,750.  That would be a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can close this deal. ",9000.0,Alice,5,
