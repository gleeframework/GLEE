"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to my maximum value.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my target,  I'm still a bit too high for my budget.  I'd like to offer $1,150,000 as a compromise.  This price acknowledges the product's value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the product's value. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $1,125,000 for the product. This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
