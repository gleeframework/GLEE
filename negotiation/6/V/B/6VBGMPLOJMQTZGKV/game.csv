"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $1100000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1300000?  This would still be a good deal for both of us. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you consider $1200000? This is the absolute maximum I'm able to pay.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
