"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $20,000. I'm thinking of making a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is too low for this product. It's high quality and I'm confident in its value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $17,000, which would be $14,500. Can we consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
At this point, Bob's offer is quite close to your minimum acceptable price. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting $14,500 ensures you make a profit and avoids the potential loss of selling to John for $15,000 if negotiations break down.
