"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to me and the fact that I'm ready to buy right now.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,250. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you and the fact that I'm still willing to sell it to you at a discount.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still outside of my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $10,500. I understand you need to make a profit, but I also need to stay within my budget. This price is fair considering the value of the product for both of us. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
