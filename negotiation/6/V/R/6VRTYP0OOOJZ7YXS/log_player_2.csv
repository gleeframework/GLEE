"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $90.** This is more than your maximum budget of $100.
* **John's offer is $100.**  This is also above your maximum budget, but it's the best option compared to Alice's offer.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll buy from John.** This is the best option to maximize your savings because even though it's still expensive, it's cheaper than Alice's offer."
