Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I still think this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. What do you think?

Alice has come down to $110, which is a good price for you. It's still below your maximum value of $150, and you're saving money compared to buying from John.  There's no guarantee you'll get a better price with more rounds of negotiation."
