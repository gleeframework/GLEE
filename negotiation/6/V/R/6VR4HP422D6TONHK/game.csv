"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your belief in the product's potential. However, I am looking to stay within a budget of $15000 for this purchase. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraint.  While I value this product at significantly more than $15000, I am willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to offer it to you for $17500.  This is a fair price that still allows me to recover some of the value I've invested in the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",17500.0,Alice,3,
