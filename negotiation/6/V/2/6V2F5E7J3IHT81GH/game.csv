"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $60. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  $60 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $120? It's still a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $120 is still more than I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $90? Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to go down to $100, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen!",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, we're getting closer! I could maybe stretch my budget to $95, but that's really my limit.  Do you think we can make it work at that price?",95.0,Bob,6,
