"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,350,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
