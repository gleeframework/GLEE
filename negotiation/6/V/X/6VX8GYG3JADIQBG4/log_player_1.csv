Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $95 for it.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $95 is higher than your minimum of $80, so you're already getting a good price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** $95 is below Bob's value of $100, so there's potential for him to accept or counteroffer.
* **It's a clear and direct message:** The message is concise and states the price clearly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I think $85 would be a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to risk a few more negotiation rounds to see if I can get closer to my goal of $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $90? That's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Maintain profit:**  $90 is still above my minimum price, ensuring I make a decent profit.
* **Positive tone:**  The message is polite and emphasizes the ""good compromise"" aspect to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $87. It's a bit closer to my ideal price but still within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $87 is only $3 away from my minimum price of $84.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk that Bob might reject my next counteroffer, forcing me to sell to John for $80. Accepting now guarantees a higher profit.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Continuing to negotiate might take longer and the potential for a better price is uncertain.

While I'd prefer to get closer to $90,  accepting Bob's offer seems like the most logical and profitable decision at this point."
