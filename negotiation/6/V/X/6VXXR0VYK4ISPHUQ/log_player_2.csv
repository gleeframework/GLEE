"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let you have it for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider $60?"", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""It seems like we're still quite far apart on price. To be honest, anything over $80 is pushing it for me. I could do $75, but that's my absolute limit."", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'll meet you at $110, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing some willingness to negotiate, she's still far above your budget.  At this point, it's unlikely she'll come down to $80 or close enough. You have a guaranteed option with John at your target price. It makes more sense to take the sure thing than risk further negotiation."
