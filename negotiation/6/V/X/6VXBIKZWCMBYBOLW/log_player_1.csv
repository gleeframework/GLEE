{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly lower than Bob's perceived value but still above my minimum. This approach allows for potential negotiation while leaving room for profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $95 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I will reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to meet halfway with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $87? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is only $3 less than my minimum acceptable price and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John for a small difference."
