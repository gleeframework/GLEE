"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to the right buyer, and I think you might be that buyer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $750000 for it. Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable paying right now.  To bridge the gap, I'd be willing to pay $800000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to secure the product while ensuring you receive a good value for it.  Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $815000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",815000.0,Alice,5,
