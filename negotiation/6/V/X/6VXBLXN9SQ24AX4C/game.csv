"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the return on investment you'll see. To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we need to find a price point that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, but that's my final offer. This is a fantastic opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
