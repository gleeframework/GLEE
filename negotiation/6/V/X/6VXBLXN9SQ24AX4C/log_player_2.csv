Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the return on investment you'll see. To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we need to find a price point that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, but that's my final offer. This is a fantastic opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer and she's unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000.  You can get the product for a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, saving you $250,000. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice at this point."
