"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $100.**  This is within your budget of $120.
* **Buying from Alice saves you $20** compared to buying from John. 

Even though you could get the product for $80 from Alice (its value to her), you're still saving money by accepting her offer."
