,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's my final offer. I'm not willing to go any higher.",14000.0,Bob,4,
