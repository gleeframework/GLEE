Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a lower price, and I can still make a decent profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's value but significantly below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation, but I still have a substantial margin of profit. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer. If things stall, I can always go with John's offer for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save even more money. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I can still do better.  I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9,200 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer of $9,200 is very close to my minimum.  Further negotiation could risk him walking away altogether. It's best to accept this offer and secure the sale."
