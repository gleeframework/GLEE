"I understand you think the product is worth $900000, but I have to prioritize my own value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $1050000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to offer $950000. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $1050000 again, but this time I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package and a 10% discount on any future purchases. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get an amazing product and some extra value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to negotiate, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the bottom of the barrel. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $1025000. I'll include the premium support package and the 10% discount on future purchases, and I'll also throw in a 30-day money-back guarantee. I think this is a very fair offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me here.",1025000.0,Alice,7,

I'll include everything I've offered before: the premium support package, the 10% discount on future purchases, and the 30-day money-back guarantee. I'm not willing to go any lower than this, so I expect you to meet me here or walk away.",1015000.0,Alice,9,
