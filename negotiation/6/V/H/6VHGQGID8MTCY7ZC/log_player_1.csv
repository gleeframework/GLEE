Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but not too far out there. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for my minimum just yet. I'll try to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price a bit to show that I'm open to negotiation, but still maintaining a profit margin. I'm hoping Bob will meet me in the middle."
