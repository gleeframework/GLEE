Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high with an offer of $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation that leads to a good price.  I'm also keeping in mind the 10-round limit and the alternative option of selling to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'm going to try and get closer to my initial asking price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,600,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway from my initial offer.  I'm hoping to strike a deal in the next round or two, as time is ticking, and selling to John is always an option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum value, but we are already in round 4. With only 6 rounds left, it's risky to continue negotiating. If I reject this offer, Bob might not come back with a higher counteroffer, and I could end up with nothing. Selling to John guarantees me $1,200,000, which is a good deal considering my minimum value."
