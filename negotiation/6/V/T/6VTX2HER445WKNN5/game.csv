,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $13,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm getting closer, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward.",12500.0,Alice,5,
