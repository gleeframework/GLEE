"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I want to maximize my profit, so I'm starting with a price that's closer to Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $100 is still a good deal for Bob, and gives him room to counteroffer if he wants. 
* **Friendly tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to keep the cost below $120. Would you consider lowering the price to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for profit:**  $95 is a good price, but I can likely do better. 
* **Test the waters:** I want to see if Bob is serious about getting the product. Rejecting his offer might make him more willing to negotiate. 
* **Not desperate:** While selling to John is an option, I'm not desperate yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 is still a little low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $97? This is a great product and I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 97}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not by much.
* **Midpoint:** $97 is a good compromise that's closer to my desired price.
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language to reinforce the value of the product and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal."
