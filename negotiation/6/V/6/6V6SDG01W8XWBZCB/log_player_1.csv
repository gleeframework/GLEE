{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum value ($100) and leaving room for negotiation. I'm also using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $80, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not ready to accept that offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is closer, I'm still a bit too high for that price. How about we split the difference and settle on $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm really trying to stick to my budget, and I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd love to sell to Bob, his final offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  John is offering me a guaranteed $100, which is a better deal than risking further negotiation with Bob."
