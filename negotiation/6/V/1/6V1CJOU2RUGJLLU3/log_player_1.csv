Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $150? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 150}
