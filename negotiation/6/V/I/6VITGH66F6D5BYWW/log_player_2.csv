"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $145. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $145**. This is more than the product's worth to you ($150).
* **John's offer is $150**. This is the maximum you're willing to spend.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to buy from John for $150, which is your limit.**

While it's tempting to save a little with Alice, you can get the product for the same price from John, and your goal is to save as much money as possible."
