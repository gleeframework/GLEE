"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it brings will far exceed the cost. Let's discuss if this price aligns with your expectations.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, however. I'll lower my price to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable deal. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
