"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good profit.  I believe Bob will be motivated to negotiate as the product is worth $1,000,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that I can get a better offer from Bob. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also want to secure a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my ideal price, $950,000 is still not enough. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to risk another round. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,000,000. This is my bottom line, as I'm guaranteed this amount from John. I believe Bob might accept this offer, as it is the value he places on the product. If he doesn't, I'll be happy to sell it to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum.  I've reached the point where I'm confident that I can't get a higher offer from Bob.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. This is the guaranteed price, and it's important for me to secure the deal."
