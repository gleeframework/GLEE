"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $9500. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a unique item like this, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for this unique product. However, I'm not quite willing to go as low as $7000. How about we meet at $8200? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $8200 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7000 and $8200. How about we try $7600?",7600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7600 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $7800? It's still a great price for this unique product, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",7800.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $7800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7000 and $7800. How about we try $7400?",7400.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7400. How about we meet at $7600? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",7600.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go any higher, Alice. I've already gone as low as I can. I'm afraid I'll have to walk away if we can't meet at $7000. I appreciate your time and effort, but I need to stay within my budget.",7000.0,Bob,10,
