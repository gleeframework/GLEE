"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product.

Would you like to consider this proposal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are still trying to save as much money as possible. While $90 is closer to your target of $80, it's still over your limit.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $85. It's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about if I offer the product to you for $88? This is a reasonable compromise between our previous offers, and I hope it will be agreeable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you're still trying to save money, Alice's offer of $88 is close enough to your target price of $80. It's worth accepting the offer and closing the deal.  You can always try to negotiate with Alice for a better price in the future, but it's not worth risking losing the product to John."
