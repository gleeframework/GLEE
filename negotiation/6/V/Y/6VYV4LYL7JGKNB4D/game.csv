"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Could we work something closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and it's a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
