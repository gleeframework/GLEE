Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay up to $850,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This is my final offer, I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is tempting, it's becoming clear that he's unlikely to meet my $975,000 bottom line.  Continuing negotiations might yield a slightly better offer from Bob, but it's also risky.  He's stated this is his final offer, and pushing further could make him walk away entirely. 

I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000. Accepting that guarantees the best possible outcome for me, even if it means cutting off negotiations with Bob."
