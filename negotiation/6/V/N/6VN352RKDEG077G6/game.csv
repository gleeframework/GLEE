"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $9,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Can we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but $9,750 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. I'll even throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. Can we meet in the middle at $10,375?",10375.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm running out of room to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $10,000, which is the lowest price I can accept. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll throw in some additional extras to sweeten the deal. Can we finally come to an agreement?",10000.0,Alice,9,
