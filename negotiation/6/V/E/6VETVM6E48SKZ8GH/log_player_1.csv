"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good margin above my minimum value while hopefully still being attractive to Bob.  I'll see how he responds before adjusting my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is my minimum, I'd prefer to make a bit more if possible.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135.  This is still a decent profit for me, and it's a bit higher than Bob's offer, so hopefully, we can reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  Bob's offer is getting lower, so I think I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is a good compromise between my minimum and Bob's last offer. I'm hoping he sees it as a fair price and accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low.  I'm willing to sell to John for $120.  It's not the best possible price, but it's my minimum, and I'm not going to keep going back and forth with Bob."
