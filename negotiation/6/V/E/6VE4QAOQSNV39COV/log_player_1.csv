Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product you might be interested in for $149. Let me know if you'd like to buy it!"",
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below your minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price to John ($150) allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate up a little if he's very interested.
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing John will buy the product for $150 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below your minimum. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate lower, or he might not be interested at all. However, this strategy maximizes your potential profit while still ensuring you don't sell below your minimum acceptable price."
