Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but still significantly lower than my own. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.
* **Strong Opening:** My message is positive and conveys a sense of value, but also leaves room for Bob to counter.
* **Plan B:** I have a backup plan with John, which gives me leverage and allows me to walk away if negotiations become unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am only able to pay $1,100,000 for the product at this time. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below what I consider the product's worth. Accepting it would leave a lot of money on the table.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and continue the negotiation process.  I can try to bridge the gap and get closer to my target price.
* **The Value of John:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me confidence to reject low offers and push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still below what I need for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise while still maintaining a strong position.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, subtly pressuring him to consider a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still unable to meet the price of $1,150,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has stuck to his $1,100,000 offer, and I've already compromised by moving to $1,150,000.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome.
* **John's Offer:**  John is willing to pay $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's final offer. It's a much better deal for me financially.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag on and waste valuable time.  Selling to John allows me to secure a good price quickly."
