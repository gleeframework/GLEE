"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great deal considering the value you'll get out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You can get the product for $8,000 from John, which is less than Alice's offer of $9,000.  It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
