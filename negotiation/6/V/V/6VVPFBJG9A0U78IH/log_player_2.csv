{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above $11,000. My next offer is $11,250. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. He's already made a counteroffer at $10,500, and Alice is coming down. It's worth seeing if they can close the gap a bit more before resorting to John's offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  How about we settle on $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000. I'm willing to go up to $11,250, as I mentioned earlier, but I can try to do a bit better. My next offer is $11,375. Let's see if we can get even closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept the offer.  He's already made it clear he's willing to pay $11,000, and Alice has come up to $11,375.  There's a good chance that Alice won't budge further, and it's getting closer to John's price of $12,000. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure the product at a reasonable price."
