Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer is $13,000, which is still better than buying from John for $15,000. Since Bob wants to save as much money as possible and this is a good deal, accepting the offer makes the most sense."
