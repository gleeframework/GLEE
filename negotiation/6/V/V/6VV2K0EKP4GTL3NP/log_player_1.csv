Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $10,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable insight into how much he might be willing to pay. If he outright rejects it, you can lower the price. If he counter-offers, you know he's serious and can negotiate further.
* **Safety Net:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's less risk in aiming higher with Bob."
