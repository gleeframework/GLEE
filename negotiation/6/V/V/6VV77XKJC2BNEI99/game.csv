"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. While I recognize this product's potential value, I'm only willing to pay $800000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1200000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1200000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $800000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your offer of $800000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your offer. How about we try $1000000? This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1000000 is getting closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to go up to $900000.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your target price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current offers. How about we try $950000? This is a small compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your continued efforts to find common ground.  $950000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $925000. This is a significant compromise on my part. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",925000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go all the way to $925000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current offers. How about we try $975000? This is a small compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,9,
