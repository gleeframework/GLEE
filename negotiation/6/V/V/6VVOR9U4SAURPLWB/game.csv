"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $850,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, as it's well below the product's true value. Let's find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $850,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still too far from what I need.  Let's split the difference between our last offers. How about $812,500? This would be a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $800,000? This is the price I was originally considering, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
