{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $900,000 is higher than $800,000, meaning Bob has some incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:** $900,000 is below your $1,000,000 minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  The message makes it clear you're open to finding a mutually agreeable price.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low,  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $1,000,000 and even below Bob's own estimate of $800,000.  I need to counter his offer and try to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $850,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, as it's well below the product's true value. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

My counteroffer of $850,000 is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not cave to his low offer.
* **Still below my minimum:** It leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Reasoned and fair:** The message explains why this price is justified. 

Let's see if Bob is ready to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $850,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is a bit closer to my desired price, it's still well below my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to make sure I can get a price that's closer to what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still too far from what I need.  Let's split the difference between our last offers. How about $812,500? This would be a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 812500} 
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Maintain a strong position:** I'm not settling for a price significantly below my minimum.
* **Appeal to logic:** I'm using a simple calculation (splitting the difference) to make the offer appear fair.

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or if we need to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $800,000? This is the price I was originally considering, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to sell to John. Here's why:

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  Even though he's willing to meet me halfway, his offer is still $200,000 below my ideal price. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might drag this out, and I don't want to risk losing John as a buyer.
* **John offers a guaranteed deal:**  John is willing to pay my minimum, and there's no risk of further negotiation.

While I would have preferred to sell to Bob,  $1,000,000 is a good price for the product, and it's the most reliable option."
