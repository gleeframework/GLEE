"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product could be useful to me, but $14,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a middle ground - how about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want you to be happy with the purchase. To meet you closer to your budget, I can go down to $12,500. This is my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
