``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum value of $150.  I'm confident that I can secure a good deal with Bob, but I'll keep John in mind as a backup option if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to $170 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to try and split the difference with Bob.  I'm confident he'll see this as a fair price and we can close the deal."

Bob's offer is only $5 below my initial asking price, and it's above my minimum. I'm happy to accept and finalize the deal with him."
