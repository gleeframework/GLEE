Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me.  This is a tactic to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can then lower the price a bit in my counter-offer, but still aim for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value for the product. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95. This is a compromise between my minimum value and Bob's offer. Hopefully, it's tempting enough for him to accept, but still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, and I'm not confident that further negotiation will lead to a better price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, so that's the best option at this point."
