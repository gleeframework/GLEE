"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it for $8,250.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I appreciate you coming down to $8,250, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $7,500. Would you be willing to consider $7,750? I think that's a fair compromise.",7750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  How about we split the difference this time and go with $8,000?  I'm really hoping to close this deal, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,7,
