"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell for anything below $8,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it for $8,250.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I appreciate you coming down to $8,250, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $7,500. Would you be willing to consider $7,750? I think that's a fair compromise.
