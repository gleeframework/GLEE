"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $9,500? It's still a fantastic price for a product worth $12,000 to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, I still feel that $8,000 is a fair price for the product. I would like to stick to this amount, as it aligns closely with my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,
