"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering it to you for $12000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering it to you for $11500.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $11000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm ready to close today.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering it to you for $12500, which is the lowest I can go without losing money. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $11250.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable deal.",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering it to you for $13000, which is as low as I can go without losing money. Let's see if we can finally meet in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to have to stick to my last offer of $11250. If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal right now. Otherwise, I'm going to have to look at other options.",11250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting close to walking away, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get as close to my minimum price as possible. I'm offering it to you for $12500, which is the absolute lowest I can go. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",12500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12500 is still not quite there for me.  I'm going to need to stick to my previous offer of $11250. This is the very last offer I can make, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to move on to other options. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",11250.0,Bob,10,
