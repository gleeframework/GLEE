"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its potential. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This represents a significant savings for you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiations. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a bit more flexibility. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000.  This would represent a substantial savings for you, and I believe it's a fair price that we can both agree on. Let's aim to close this deal in a way that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your desire for a better price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What are your thoughts?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
