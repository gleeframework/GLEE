"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its potential. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
