Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $120, knowing that Bob values the product at $150. This gives me room for negotiation.
* **Building Rapport:**  The message is friendly and aims to build a positive relationship with Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm willing to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects: I'll analyze his counteroffer and use the information to determine my next move. 
* Remember, I can always sell to John for $80 if the negotiation with Bob breaks down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I can only pay $100 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $80.** While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to accept a price that low.
* **Negotiation is still possible.**  I believe I can get a higher price by counter-offering.  

**Next Steps:** 
I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer. I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer of $120, but I need to be realistic and understand Bob's budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $110?  That's still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's midway between my previous offer ($120) and Bob's offer ($100). This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Maintain Value:** $110 is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages further discussion. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: I've successfully negotiated a good price.
* If Bob rejects: I'll have to consider selling to John or making another counteroffer, carefully considering my options and Bob's likely response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still unable to pay more than $100 for the product. If you could meet me at that price, I would be happy to purchase it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has stubbornly stuck to his $100 offer, refusing to budge.
* **Minimum Acceptable Price:**  I'm not willing to go lower than $80, as that's my minimum value for the product. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing the negotiation could drag on and consume valuable time.

**Next Steps:** 

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, selling to John for $80 is a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer. This ensures I at least get my minimum value and avoid further negotiation that might not be fruitful."
