"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm going for a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also adding a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to find the product for a bit less. Would you consider selling it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold of $150.  I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could you consider selling it to me for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a price that works for you, but $110 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $115.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm trying to stick to my budget. Would you consider selling it to me for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I've made several concessions, and Bob is still unwilling to budge from his price.  It's clear that he's determined to pay the minimum possible, and it's unlikely we'll reach a mutually agreeable price. It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $150. This guarantees me a profit, and it's better than risking another round of negotiation with Bob that might not yield a better outcome."
