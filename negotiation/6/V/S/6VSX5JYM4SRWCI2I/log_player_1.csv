"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:**  It's always good to start negotiations above your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Appear enthusiastic:**  Framing the offer positively can make Bob more receptive.
* **Leave room for compromise:**  While $130 is a high starting point, it's not so outrageous that it would immediately turn Bob off."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still below your minimum. You have room to negotiate and try to get closer to $100 before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $115?"", ""product_price"": 115}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility:**  You're moving closer to Bob's offer, signaling that you're willing to negotiate.
* **Stay above your minimum:** The new price is still comfortably above your $100 minimum.
* **Encourage a counteroffer:** By making a significant decrease but not meeting Bob's price, you encourage him to make a counteroffer and hopefully meet you closer to the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer, and while it's not your ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise. Accepting $95 is better than risking Bob walking away or having to settle for John's $100 offer in a later round."
