"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can make this work.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the value of the product to you, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's find common ground here.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,600,000.  However, I'm still only able to offer $1,500,000.  This is the absolute maximum I can pay, as it's my budget limit.  It's a fair price for both of us, as you've stated the product is worth this much to you. Let's finalize the deal at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
