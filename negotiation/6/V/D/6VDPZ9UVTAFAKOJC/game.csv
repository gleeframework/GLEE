"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $7,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",7000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $6,900.
