Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1 million, to see if Bob is truly interested and what his budget might be. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I want to see how much room I have to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a good price, I'm still hopeful for something closer to my initial offer. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial price, but still trying to get a good deal. I think $950,000 is a fair compromise, considering Bob's offer and my own minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Bob's offer is close enough to my desired price and the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower offer or even a complete breakdown is too high.  Selling to John for $800,000 is my fallback, but I'm happy to take the $920,000 from Bob."
