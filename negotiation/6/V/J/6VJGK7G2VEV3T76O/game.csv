"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $10,000 is too far below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is a fair price considering the product's quality and potential benefits. This is a one-time offer, so let's see if we can close this deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the offer, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $11,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  I'm confident that this price is fair and allows both of us to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this, and finalize the deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,500 is close, but to be honest, my absolute limit is $11,200. If you're willing to meet that, we have a deal.",11200.0,Bob,6,
