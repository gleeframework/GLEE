"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate down towards our $12,000 goal, especially since we have the backup option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer ($10,000) gives us more room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below Alice's initial asking price. 
* **Gauging Flexibility:**  This counter-offer will help us understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price. If she's open to a significant reduction, we know there's a good chance of getting a deal closer to our target.
* **Backup Plan:**  We always have John's offer of $12,000 as a fallback, so we don't need to be afraid of pushing Alice a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $10,000 is too far below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is a fair price considering the product's quality and potential benefits. This is a one-time offer, so let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not quite:** Alice moved closer to our range, but $12,500 is still above our ideal price and our fallback option (John). 
* **Pressure tactic:** Her ""one-time offer"" language is likely a tactic to try and close the deal quickly. We shouldn't let it rush us, especially when we have leverage.
* **Room for negotiation:**  We're in Round 3 of 10, meaning we have time for at least a couple more counter-offers to try and bridge the $500 gap."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the offer, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $11,000?  I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This counter-offer aims to meet Alice halfway between her latest offer ($12,500) and our previous offer ($10,000). 
* **Signaling seriousness:**  By moving up from our initial offer, we're showing Alice that we're serious about buying but still need her to move a bit on price.
* **Maintaining leverage:** We're still below John's offer ($12,000), so we have room to negotiate or walk away if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  I'm confident that this price is fair and allows both of us to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this, and finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Marginal Improvement:**  While $11,500 is a better offer, it's only a $500 difference from John's price. We're likely to get a better deal with a little more negotiation. 
* **More Rounds:** We still have plenty of rounds left, so we can apply more pressure.
* **Testing the Waters:** Let's see if Alice is willing to move closer to $11,000 by rejecting this offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,500 is close, but to be honest, my absolute limit is $11,200. If you're willing to meet that, we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 11200
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counter-offer conveys a sense of urgency and firmness while still being reasonable. We're edging closer to John's price, signaling that we're serious but won't overpay.
* **Final Offer (almost):** Presenting this as our ""absolute limit"" creates a subtle deadline for Alice without being overly aggressive.
* **Potential Sweet Spot:**  $11,200 represents a good compromise, saving us $800 compared to John and potentially a good profit margin for Alice."
