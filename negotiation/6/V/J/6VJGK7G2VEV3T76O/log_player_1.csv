"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to make Bob feel good about the offer. 
* **Highlight Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to make it more appealing to Bob. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Get Bob's attention:** A high initial offer might make him think about the deal more seriously.
* **Set the negotiation tone:** It establishes a baseline for future negotiations.
* **Leave room for concessions:**  This gives me space to lower the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Selling to John is still an option:** I can always choose to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well. 

I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob, so rejecting his current offer makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $10,000 is too far below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is a fair price considering the product's quality and potential benefits. This is a one-time offer, so let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer with Justification:** I'm offering $12,500, which is a significant step down from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. I provide a justification for the price by emphasizing the product's quality and potential benefits.
* **Limited Time Offer:** I'm creating a sense of urgency by calling it a one-time offer, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Focus on Closing the Deal:** I'm explicitly stating my intention to close the deal, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but also setting boundaries.

This strategy aims to:

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate by reducing my price.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  The price is still above Bob's offer, indicating that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Encourage a Quick Resolution:**  The limited-time offer element adds pressure for Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the offer, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $11,000?  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I want for the product.  I want to try and push for a little more.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and see if I can reach a deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  I'm confident that this price is fair and allows both of us to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this, and finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Emphasize Fairness:** I'm reiterating that I believe the new price is fair for both parties, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Focus on Finalization:** I'm highlighting the possibility of finalizing the deal, emphasizing the potential benefits of agreement.

This strategy aims to:

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm again demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by reducing my price further.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  The price is still above Bob's offer, indicating that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Encourage a Quick Resolution:**  I'm expressing confidence in the proposed price and emphasizing the benefits of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,500 is close, but to be honest, my absolute limit is $11,200. If you're willing to meet that, we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,200 is still below my desired price, it's getting very close to it.  Since it's Bob's absolute limit and we are in round 6, it's likely that we won't get any higher with further negotiation.  Therefore, accepting his offer is the best choice, as it guarantees a sale and I'm only $3,800 away from my minimum acceptable price.  Selling to John is still an option, but it would result in a much lower profit for me."
