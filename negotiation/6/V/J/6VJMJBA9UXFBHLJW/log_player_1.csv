Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $8,500 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  Could you consider meeting me halfway at $9,000? I'm confident you'll see a considerable return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to go down to $8,800? I think that's a more reasonable price considering the market rate and the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $8,800 is a good deal. It's significantly above my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation leading to no deal with Bob.
