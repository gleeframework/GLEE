Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a reasonable starting point considering my minimum value is $8,000. It gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm curious to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is pretty close to my minimum value, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price and avoid further negotiation."
