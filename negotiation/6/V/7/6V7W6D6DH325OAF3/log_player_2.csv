"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to start a negotiation and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product,  $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant amount for me and a fair price considering your cost.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is lower than I can go. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I want to continue negotiating and see if I can get a better deal closer to my initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is closer to my initial offer.  This shows good faith, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I'm aiming for the best possible deal, I understand the need to find a compromise. How about we settle this at $887,500?  This is a significant investment for you, and I want to ensure it feels like a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is getting close to my initial counteroffer of $850,000.  It's a good deal for me, given that I can get the product for less than $900,000 and avoid the risk of further negotiations that could lead to a higher price or a deal with John at $1,000,000.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiations will only be incremental and it's better to lock in this price."
