Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product,  $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant amount for me and a fair price considering your cost.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
