"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle on $65?"", 
""product_price"": 65
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than the asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Aiming for Savings:** My goal is to save as much as possible. Starting at $65 aims for a substantial discount while still being within a potentially acceptable range. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to counter, and for us to potentially meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $90 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $65. How about we meet in the middle at $77? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $77. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $77
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $77 is closer to a price I'd consider, it's still above my target and what John is offering. There's room for Alice to come down further, so I'll reject and counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $77 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more around $70.  Would that be possible?"", 
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Steady Progression:** I'm moving my offer up incrementally, showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate but also standing firm on seeking a lower price.
* **Target Range:** $70 is a good balance point â€“ a significant saving from Alice's initial offer but also a price where I'm getting closer to considering a deal. 
* **Pressure Point:**  With each round, we're getting closer to the point where buying from John for $80 might make more sense. This offer keeps the negotiation moving but also subtly introduces a bit of time pressure for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet at $75? It's still a good compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $75 is a solid price and a significant saving from Alice's initial offer. 
* **Time Value:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation. Continuing to push for a lower price (which may not happen) risks running out of rounds and potentially missing out on both Alice's deal and John's offer.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I could try to haggle Alice down further, the potential savings at this point are minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting now secures a good price and avoids potentially having to settle for John's $80 offer."
