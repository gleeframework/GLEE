"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to come down to $10,500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $10,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm prepared to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet somewhere in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,6,
