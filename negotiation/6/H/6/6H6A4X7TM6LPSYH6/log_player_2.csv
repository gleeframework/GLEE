"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is a good deal, it's still above his maximum budget of $100.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $120 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, which is my absolute max. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to make a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is $110, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  While it's a better price than her initial offer, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate. Bob can simply buy the product from John for $100 and save himself the hassle and potential for further negotiation."
