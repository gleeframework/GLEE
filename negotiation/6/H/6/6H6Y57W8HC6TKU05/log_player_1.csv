"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This is a strong opening offer that gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm taking a chance that he might be willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm not willing to accept it. I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $13,000. This is still above my minimum value, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair compromise. I'm aiming for a quick deal, so I'm willing to give some ground to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. It's getting closer to my minimum value, but I'm not willing to accept it yet. I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value. I'm still hoping to get a better price than what John is offering, so I'm not ready to sell to him yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $11,500. This is still above my minimum value, but it's closer to Bob's last offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground to see if we can reach an agreement. If Bob still rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm running out of time, and while I'm not happy about selling to John for only $12,000, it's better than taking a loss by accepting Bob's offer. It's time to cut my losses and move on."
