"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're interested in the product, but I'm afraid $850000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and your interest, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $900000. This is a fair price that still gives you a good deal, and I believe it's worth considering.",900000.0,Alice,3,
