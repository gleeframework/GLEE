You can do better than $100. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 was a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

$92.50 is still a bit too high.  Let's see if we can get a little closer to my target."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $95? It's getting close to my minimum, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

Alice is getting close to her minimum, so it's probably time to accept her offer.  While $95 isn't the absolute best deal, it's still a decent price for the product and better than buying from John."
