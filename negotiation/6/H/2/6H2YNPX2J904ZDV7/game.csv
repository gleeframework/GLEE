"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $85?  Let me know what you think!",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 was a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for me.  Would you consider $90?  That would make it a great deal for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $95? It's getting close to my minimum, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",95.0,Alice,5,
