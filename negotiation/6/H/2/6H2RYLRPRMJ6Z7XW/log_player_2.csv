Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is far too much for him, and he has a better option with John."

Alice's offer:

While $18,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than his limit. He should reject and try to get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $18,000, which would be $16,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000. Even though Alice has come down to $16,000, that's still above Bob's limit of $12,000. It's clear that Alice isn't willing to negotiate further, so Bob should take the guaranteed deal with John."
