Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get as close to my ideal value as possible.  This price is a good starting point to see if Bob is interested in negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm counteroffering at $145, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum.  While I could continue negotiating, it seems like we're unlikely to reach a price I'm comfortable with.  It's better to sell to John and secure my minimum value."
