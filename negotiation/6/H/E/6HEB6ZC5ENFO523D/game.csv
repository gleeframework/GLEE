"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15000.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I am still unable to meet at $13000. I would like to offer $12000 for the product. This is my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13000. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $12500. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product is $15000.",12500.0,Alice,5,
