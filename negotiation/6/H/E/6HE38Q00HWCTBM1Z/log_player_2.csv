"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your interests, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price seems a bit high for me starting out.  Would you consider $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiating generally benefits from starting lower than your ideal target. This leaves room to move upward while staying within my budget.
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message acknowledges Alice's offer but clearly states my position that the initial price is too high.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $900,000 is a significant drop, but it's still well above Alice's perceived value of $800,000. This gives her room to negotiate while keeping me far below John's fallback offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a price point that works for both of us, $900,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer, reflecting the value I know this product holds.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Negotiating:** Her willingness to move down to $1,100,000 shows she's open to negotiation. 
* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While $1,100,000 is closer to a reasonable price, it's still above a point where I should immediately accept.  There's a good chance we can settle somewhere between our current positions.
* **John's Price as Leverage:** Knowing John will sell for $1,500,000 gives me a strong fallback position. I'm not in a desperate situation."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  How about we settle at $1,000,000 even?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):**  This counteroffer is a bit above the exact midpoint between our last offers ($1,100,000 and $900,000). It shows willingness to move closer while still leaving room for a potential final concession from Alice.
* **Psychologically Appealing Number:** $1,000,000 is a clean and often psychologically compelling number in negotiations. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** I want to keep the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement. A firm but reasonable counteroffer helps achieve that."
