"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price seems a bit high for me starting out.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a price point that works for both of us, $900,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer, reflecting the value I know this product holds.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  How about we settle at $1,000,000 even?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
