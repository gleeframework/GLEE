Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for your product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I can acquire a similar product from another seller for $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
