"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make a deal!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for your product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I can acquire a similar product from another seller for $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be compensated for the value I place on this product. I'll accept $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you and my opportunity cost of selling to John. Let's come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This reflects the value the product holds for me and acknowledges your need for a reasonable price.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
