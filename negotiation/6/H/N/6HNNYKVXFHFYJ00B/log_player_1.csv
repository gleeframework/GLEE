"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($10,000) to try and maximize my profit. I'm going for a significant markup (50% in this case), but I'm aware this is likely to be rejected.  This initial offer will give me valuable information about Bob's interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below my desired profit margin. I believe there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and continue to explore a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a slight counteroffer, increasing the price by $500 from Bob's last offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profit.  I believe this offer is reasonable and likely to be accepted by Bob, as he's already shown interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my desired price point. Accepting his offer at $14,200 will allow me to get a good profit. While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Bob will reject my next offer or that I'll run out of rounds. It's better to secure a good deal than to risk a lower offer or losing the sale altogether."
