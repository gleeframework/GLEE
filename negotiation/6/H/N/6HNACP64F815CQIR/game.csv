"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1800000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $1000000. This is my best offer and reflects the value I see in this product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, after considering your proposal, I'm afraid $1000000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1400000. This is my best counteroffer so far, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and I'll offer you $1200000. This is a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I need a bit of a premium for the exclusivity and quality of this product. I'm now offering the product to you for $1300000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
