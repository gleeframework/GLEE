Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, after considering your proposal, I'm afraid $1000000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1400000. This is my best counteroffer so far, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Alice's offer is still too high.  We can keep negotiating to try and get a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and I'll offer you $1,200,000. This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I need a bit of a premium for the exclusivity and quality of this product. I'm now offering the product to you for $1300000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

Alice is only willing to go down to $1,300,000. Since Jhon is selling the product for $1,200,000, it's time to go with Jhon and save some money."
