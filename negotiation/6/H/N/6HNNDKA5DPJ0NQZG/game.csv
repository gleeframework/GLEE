"Alice, while I see the potential in this product, $1500000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1350000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1275000? This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
