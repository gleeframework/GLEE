"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if there's room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. Hopefully, this will encourage him to come closer to my asking price."

{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,250,000.  This is closer to Bob's latest offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this shows him that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that is drastically lower than what I know the product is worth."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've had 8 rounds of negotiations with Bob and his offers are still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk ending up with a deal that undervalues the product. Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I get a fair price for the product and avoids potentially losing out on a better deal."
