Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it signals my serious intent to buy while also leaving room for negotiation. I believe $500,000 is a reasonable starting point given my budget of $800,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
