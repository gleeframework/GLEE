"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. I think this is a great price considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1350000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $1250000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm willing to meet you at $1290000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1290000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than $1250000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price. I'm also considering buying the product from John for $1500000, which is my maximum budget.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
