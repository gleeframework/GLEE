"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $10500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm willing to negotiate with you. Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and go with $9750? I think this is a fair price that reflects both of our needs.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $10250 to make this deal worthwhile. Let's try to reach a compromise and get this deal done.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  $10250 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9875. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",9875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles here. $9875 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10000 as a final offer. If you're serious about getting this product, this is the best price you're going to get.  Think about it, and let's close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,7,
