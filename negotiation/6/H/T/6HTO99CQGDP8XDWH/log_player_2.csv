"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above his target of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $10500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm willing to negotiate with you. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still higher than Bob's target of $8,000.  There's still room for negotiation and potentially a better deal to be had. It's worth seeing if Alice will lower the price further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,750? I think this is a fair price that reflects both of our needs."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $10250 to make this deal worthwhile. Let's try to reach a compromise and get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, $10,250 is still above Bob's target of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will go lower before considering buying from John. There are still 5 rounds left, so there's time to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  $10,250 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,875. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9875}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles here. $9875 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10000 as a final offer. If you're serious about getting this product, this is the best price you're going to get.  Think about it, and let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is $10,000, which is still above Bob's target of $8,000. With only 3 rounds remaining, the chances of getting Alice to go any lower are slim. Buying from John for $8,000 ensures Bob gets the product at his desired price, saving him $2,000 compared to Alice's final offer."
