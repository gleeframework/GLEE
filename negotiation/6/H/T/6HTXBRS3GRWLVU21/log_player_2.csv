"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase. Would you be willing to meet me at a price of $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  

* Buying from Alice for $1,400,000 is cheaper than buying from John, but it still means paying more than the product's worth to Bob. 
* Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to negotiate with her further or consider other options. 
* Buying from John is the last resort and only happens if Bob cannot find a better deal. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob keeps his options open to potentially find a better price."
