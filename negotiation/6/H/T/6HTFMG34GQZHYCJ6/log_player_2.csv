Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. My final offer is $987,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of the product while still offering you a significant gain.  Let me know your decision â€“ this is my best offer.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and while there's room for negotiation, the difference is getting smaller.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower. Accepting at $987,000 secures a significant saving compared to John's $1,200,000 price."
