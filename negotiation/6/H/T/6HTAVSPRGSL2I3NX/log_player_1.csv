Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, I'm holding out for a better price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the next few rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle at $82.50?"", ""product_price"": 82.50}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $78 for the product. Can you consider my offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $78 is getting closer, I'm still confident that I can get a better price with a few more rounds of negotiation. I'm not in a rush, and I'm not willing to sell for less than what I believe the product is worth."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you.  How about we meet in the middle again and go with $80? This would be a good deal for both of us, and it's closer to my asking price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}
