"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,350,000? This price reflects the product's value and allows for a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still not quite there for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This compromise acknowledges your needs while allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let's work together to close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting close!  I understand your budget constraints, but $1,280,000 is still just a bit too low for me.  How about $1,290,000? It's a small difference, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.  Let's make this happen!",1290000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,290,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,280,000, which is the best I can do. Can we agree on this price?",1280000.0,Bob,8,
