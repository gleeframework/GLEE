"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe could be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at a price significantly higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport with Bob.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm mentioning the product's potential value to Bob, hoping to pique his interest. 

**Note:** This is just my first offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer is still above my minimum value of $10,000, indicating there's potential for a more profitable deal. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially secure a higher price.
* **Strategic counteroffer:** In the next round, I can counter with a price between $12,500 and my original asking price of $15,000, aiming to find a mutually acceptable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500. It's a fair price considering the potential value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising, but not too much:** I'm reducing the price by $1,000 from my previous offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a profit margin above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing value again:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential value to justify the price.
* **Encouraging acceptance:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to nudge Bob towards accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure if $13500 is the best price for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  Bob's offer is still above my minimum selling price of $10,000. This means there's still potential to get a higher price. 
* **Time pressure:** We are now in round 4, meaning there are only 6 rounds remaining. While I want to be careful not to lose Bob, I also don't want to rush into accepting a price that might be too low. 
* **Strategic counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that bridges the gap, potentially leading to a mutually acceptable price. 

I'll aim for a price closer to my preferred price point, hoping to reach an agreement in the coming rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find a good deal here. I'm willing to go to $13,000. This is a great price for a product with the potential we've discussed. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  My counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. It shows I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Emphasizing value (again):**  I'm reiterating the product's potential value as a reason for the price.
* **Urgency:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept the offer, especially since we're in the middle of the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to strike a balance between securing a good price and avoiding a deadlock. I'll monitor Bob's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still not comfortable with $13000. Would you be willing to meet me at $12900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're in round 6, and with only 4 rounds left, the pressure is mounting.
* **Small difference:** Bob's offer is only $100 less than my previous counteroffer. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's not a significant difference.
* **Risk of losing Bob:**  Bob is hinting at walking away. There's a real risk that if I reject this offer, I might lose him as a buyer and be forced to sell to John for a much lower price.

**Overall:**  Accepting this offer is a calculated risk. I'm accepting a slightly lower price, but it guarantees a sale and prevents me from potentially losing Bob altogether."
