"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a good starting point. $750,000 is a great deal for Bob, but there's likely room to negotiate further.  It's worth exploring if Alice will go lower before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it still leaves room for negotiation.  It's a bold move that could potentially lead to a quick deal or push Alice to make a counter-counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is a decent price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal goal.  There's still room to negotiate, and it's worth pushing Alice further before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows that Bob is serious about getting the product but is still trying to get a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is approaching a decent price, it's still too high for Bob's ideal goal.  Given that there are still five rounds left, it's worth pushing for a lower price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to budge a bit but is still trying to keep the price below $800,000.  It's a strategic move that could push Alice to accept or counter with a price closer to Bob's target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

With only 3 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating with Alice. Alice is clearly unwilling to budge much lower, and $900,000 is far from Bob's ideal price.  Given that John offers a set price of $1,500,000, it's more prudent for Bob to secure the product now rather than risk losing it altogether."
