,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $100 is a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth a lot more to you! What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $95 isn't quite enough for me. Let's compromise at $100. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to my budget, but I'd like to try to get it down a bit more. Can you meet me at $97.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",97.5,Bob,6,
