Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price:**  $15,000 (since that's what I can get from John).
* **Bob's maximum acceptable price:** $10,000.
* **Negotiation:**  By offering $14,000, I'm leaving some room for negotiation. Bob might be willing to pay a little more than his initial valuation, and I'm still earning a decent amount. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while still leaving a chance for a deal with Bob."
