"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? ",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,112,500.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you say?",1112500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,112,500 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. How about we settle at $1,093,750?  That keeps us moving towards a fair deal.",1093750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,093,750 is still too low for me.  Let's meet halfway between our last two offers. How about $1,103,125?  This is a reasonable compromise that allows us to move forward with the deal. ",1103125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate you working with me.  I can do $1,098,437.50.  It's a fair offer that bridges the gap and shows I'm serious about closing this deal.",1098437.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about making this deal work.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,098,437.50 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it allows us to finally close this transaction. ",1100000.0,Alice,7,
