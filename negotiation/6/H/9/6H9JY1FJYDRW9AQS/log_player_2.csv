Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,112,500.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you say?

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about making this deal work.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,098,437.50 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it allows us to finally close this transaction.

Alice is clearly committed to this back-and-forth negotiation style, and we're unlikely to get a significantly better deal from her. Accepting at $1,100,000 saves us $100,000 compared to John's offer."
