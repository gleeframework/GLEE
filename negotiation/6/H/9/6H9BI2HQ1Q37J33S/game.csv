"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $8,500? This is still a great deal for you, as it's significantly lower than what you're willing to pay, and it's closer to my minimum.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,750 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll accept $8,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to what you're willing to pay and above my minimum. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
