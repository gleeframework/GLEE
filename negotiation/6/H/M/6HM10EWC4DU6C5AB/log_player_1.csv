Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, bringing you closer to his maximum.
* **Secure a Sale:** Offering a price significantly lower than $12,000 might make Bob suspicious or undervalue the product.  

This strategy aims to secure a sale at a price that is highly profitable for you while remaining appealing to Bob."
