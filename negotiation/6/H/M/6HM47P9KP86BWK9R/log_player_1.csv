Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for the highest possible price that Bob might accept allows you to maximize your profit.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Starting with a strong offer ($950,000) positions the product as highly valuable while leaving some room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000 gives you leverage in negotiations. You are not desperate to sell below that price."
