"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000.

Therefore, it makes the most sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John to maximize your savings."
