"I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but only to $1700000. This price still allows for a healthy profit for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's keep the negotiation moving forward.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but $1700000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1350000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're looking for.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1600000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've invested in this negotiation. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a win-win situation for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but no higher. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiation we've had so far.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
