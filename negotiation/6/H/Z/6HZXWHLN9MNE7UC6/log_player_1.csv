"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you do $130? That's a significant reduction on my part to try and find a compromise."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However,  $130 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Bob is attempting to negotiate, his offers are too far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's unlikely he'll come close enough to be worthwhile, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the guaranteed $150 from John."
