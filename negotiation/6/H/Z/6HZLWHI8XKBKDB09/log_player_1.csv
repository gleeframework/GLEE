Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1050000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential we can both gain from this deal.
