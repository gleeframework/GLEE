,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1050000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential we can both gain from this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1175000.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1175000.  I'm still not quite there yet, but I'm willing to meet you halfway *again*  and offer $1112500. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both see in this deal.",1112500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $1112500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1150000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1150000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  However, I'm committed to making this deal work.  I'm willing to go up to $1125000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's close this deal.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to go up to $1125000, Bob. I think I can meet you there, but I'm not going to give away the product for less than $1200000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
