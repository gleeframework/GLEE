"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. Let's get started with a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate the value of this product.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for starting the negotiation. That price is a bit too high for me right now. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers? I could do $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $800,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. Let's try $1,100,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she's not willing to go below $1,100,000. You know you can get the product for $800,000 from John.  There's no point in further negotiation with Alice if you're not willing to pay more than John's price."
