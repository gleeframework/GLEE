"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. Let's get started with a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate the value of this product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for starting the negotiation. That price is a bit too high for me right now. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers? I could do $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $800,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. Let's try $1,100,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
