Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially capture a larger portion of the surplus value. 
* **Framing it as fair:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to make him more likely to accept a higher price. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by saying ""Let me know your thoughts."" 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  By offering a price that's closer to my minimum, I'm still in a good position to sell to John if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment of the product's value, I would like to propose a price of $900,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value you place on the product and what I am willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a significant improvement over my minimum of $800,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price of $1,000,000, accepting this offer guarantees a profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal entirely.  

It's important to consider the following:

* **Negotiation is a process:**  It's unlikely I'll get my full asking price in the first round.
* **Time and effort:** Continuing to negotiate might take more time and effort, potentially leading to a lower price or a failed negotiation.
* **John's offer:** While John is willing to pay $800,000, accepting Bob's offer secures a higher price and avoids potentially losing out to Bob later in the negotiation process."
