"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $145. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price!",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $145 is still a little too steep for me. Would you be willing to do $125? That would be a great price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $135. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,
