You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $145. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $135. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:

At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Accepting at $135 secures a decent discount from both Alice's original price and John's offer."
