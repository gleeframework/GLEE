"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value and appreciate your suggestion. However, I am looking to keep my spending within a budget of $120. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe there's room for negotiation.  Since Bob acknowledged the product's value, there's a chance he'll be willing to pay a bit more. I'll try to counter-offer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a bit more than that. The product is worth a lot to me, and I'm willing to go down to $130.  If you're interested in this price, let me know. Otherwise, I might have to consider other offers."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $125. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $125 is a good compromise. It's a bit lower than I initially wanted, but it's still higher than what John is offering, and it's within my acceptable range.  It's also likely that continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
