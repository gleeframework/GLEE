You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.  It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You have room to negotiate since you can always buy from John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, giving us some room to negotiate. It's a reasonable starting point, considering our maximum budget is $1,200,000. We can adjust this offer based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above our maximum budget. We can try to negotiate further, potentially by increasing our counteroffer slightly. There's a good chance we can get a better price than $1,400,000, especially considering we have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're increasing our offer slightly, showing Alice we're serious about buying the product. However, we're staying below our maximum budget and leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.  This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is within our budget and represents a significant decrease from her initial offer.  While we could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting our counteroffer and driving the price up again is real. It's better to secure this deal at a price we're comfortable with rather than risk losing it entirely."
