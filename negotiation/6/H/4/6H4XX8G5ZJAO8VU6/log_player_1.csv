{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're not giving away the product for less than it's worth to you. 
* **It's not too high:** You want Bob to be interested and not immediately reject the offer.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  By offering $17,500, you give Bob some room to counteroffer without you having to feel like you're losing too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum value for the product. It's better to try to negotiate further with Bob than to accept his offer or sell to John at a lower price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 15500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I have a budget in mind. How about $13,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your ideal price point.  Since John is willing to pay $15,000, it's worth seeing if you can push Bob higher, or at least meet in the middle."
