Bob's offer:

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are escalating too slowly. It's unlikely he'll reach a price point that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting John's offer is the most logical choice at this stage to maximize profit and minimize further negotiation time."
