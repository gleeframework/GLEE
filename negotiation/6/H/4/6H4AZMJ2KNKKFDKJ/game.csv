"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $10,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,500 is still too low.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be very happy with the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
