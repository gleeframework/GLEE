You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,700,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the product for a better price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

Bob is going to start by making a bold counteroffer at his maximum price. This is a good starting point because he doesn't have much room to negotiate and wants to see if Alice is willing to come down significantly to avoid losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than the initial offer, it's still above his target price. He has a guaranteed alternative from John, and it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to drop her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

Bob is going to increase his counteroffer slightly. This shows Alice that he is serious about getting the product but also maintains some room to negotiate further. Since Alice rejected his initial offer, he might need to make a slightly higher counteroffer to show he's willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his target, he's still better off sticking with his plan of negotiating further with Alice. The fact that she has lowered her price shows she is willing to compromise. It's worth seeing if she will come down even further, especially since he has a guaranteed alternative from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

Bob is going to continue to slowly increase his counteroffer, showing Alice that he's willing to compromise while also pushing her towards a price closer to his target. He's still aware of his alternative from John, so he's not in a rush to accept a price that is above his maximum."
