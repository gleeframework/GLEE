"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm going to start with a price slightly higher than my minimum desired price ($1,500,000). This is to leave room for negotiation while also emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, below my minimum value for the product. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm dropping the price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still staying above my minimum price.  This should encourage Bob to make a counteroffer closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to try to negotiate a bit further, but I'm starting to get concerned about the time limit. I may have to consider selling to John if we don't reach a deal soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm dropping the price further to 1,450,000.  This is a significant concession but it's the last one I'm willing to make without selling to John.  If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'm likely going to cut my losses and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This negotiation isn't going anywhere fast. Bob's offers are still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're running out of rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John to secure a better price."
