"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to make you an offer. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price. You can always buy from John for $800,000 if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit below my initial asking price. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is a good price.  It's only $75,000 more than John's price, and you're only a few rounds in. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially getting stuck with John's price."
