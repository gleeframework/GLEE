Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $150. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price. I'm willing to counteroffer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 
I'm offering $175, which is still higher than my minimum value of $150, but closer to Bob's offer. I'm trying to strike a balance and see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $140 is still above my minimum value of $150.  It seems unlikely that Bob will go any higher, and I'm not comfortable risking selling to John for $150 when I can get more from Bob."
