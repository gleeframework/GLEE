# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $180. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'm not interested in paying $180, that's way above my budget. The product is worth $150 to Alice, so she's not even giving me a discount. I'll reject her offer and look for a better deal.
