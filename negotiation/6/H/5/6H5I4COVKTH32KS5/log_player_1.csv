This offer starts at a price higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation, hopefully leading to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is slightly lower than my initial asking price but still above my minimum.  Accepting his offer allows me to sell the product quickly and efficiently."
