Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its worth, I'm offering it to you at a price of $2,000,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to both of us, starting with a higher offer of $2,000,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Sense of Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value, which could justify the high price in Bob's mind.
* **Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" adds a sense of urgency that might encourage Bob to accept quickly. 

**Worst Case:** Bob rejects the offer, and I sell to John for my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.

**Best Case:** Bob accepts the $2,000,000 offer, and I make a $500,000 profit."
