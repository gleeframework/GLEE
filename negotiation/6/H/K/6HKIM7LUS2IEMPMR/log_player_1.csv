"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I know the product is worth at least $8,000 to me, so I'm setting the initial price at $10,000.  This gives Bob room to negotiate while still potentially giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $9,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. Hopefully, this will be closer to a price that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my initial price and significantly better than selling to John for $8,000. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
