Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the fact that I have other offers on the table. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum desired price of $1,500,000 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair deal for both of us. I acknowledge Bob's potential value, but also highlight the competition I have to make it seem like he needs to act quickly. 

This approach is a good starting point. I will need to adapt my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is a significant discount from your original price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* While $900,000 is a better offer than Bob's first one, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.
* Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation. However, I want to explore the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob. 
* By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.

I will need to strategize my counteroffer carefully, taking into account Bob's initial offer and my own desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile.  This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $1,100,000. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing a willingness to negotiate but also emphasizing that my price needs to be closer to my desired price. I am also highlighting the value Bob will get from the product to justify my counteroffer.  

This counteroffer shows that I am serious about selling to Bob, but I am not willing to settle for a price that is significantly below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that I'm willing to commit to purchasing it from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum.** I'm not sure how much further Bob is willing to go. 
* **The risk of further negotiation is too high.**  We're getting closer, but I'm not confident I can get Bob to agree to a price that meets my minimum.
* **Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and minimizes risk.**  While I'd prefer to get a slightly higher price, the certainty of John's offer is more valuable than the potential of further negotiations with Bob. 

It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed deal."
