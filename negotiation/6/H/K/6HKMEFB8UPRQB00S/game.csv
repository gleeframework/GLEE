"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the fact that I have other offers on the table. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is a significant discount from your original price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile.  This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that I'm willing to commit to purchasing it from you.",950000.0,Bob,4,
