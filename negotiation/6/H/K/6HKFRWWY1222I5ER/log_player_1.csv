"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still allowing me to make a significant profit.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is a significant concession, but I'm still holding out for a higher price than what John is offering.  The negotiation is getting tense, so I need to show flexibility to keep Bob at the table.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept, as it's a good price for him and a decent profit for me."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting close to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I only have two rounds left, so I need to be strategic. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round and see if I can close the deal at a price closer to what I want."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm coming down to $17,000, which is only $500 above John's offer.  With only one round left, I need to make a significant concession to entice Bob to accept. I'm hoping this offer will be enough to close the deal."

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. Bob's final offer is close to my minimum, but I don't have any more rounds to negotiate, and I risk walking away with nothing if I reject his offer.  While I would have preferred a higher price,  $15,000 is still a decent profit, and it's better than losing out entirely."
