Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. I believe the product's value is worth it, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of owning it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $8,200, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I believe the product's value is worth more than that, but I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,200.  At this point, it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed deal from John at $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
