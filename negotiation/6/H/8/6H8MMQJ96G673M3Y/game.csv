"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me in the middle at $105?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $115, which is still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
