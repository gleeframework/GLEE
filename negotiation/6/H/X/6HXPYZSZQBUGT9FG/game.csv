"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer. Let me know your thoughts!",11500.0,Alice,1,
