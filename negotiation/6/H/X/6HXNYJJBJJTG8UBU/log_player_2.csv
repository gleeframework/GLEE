# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $90.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Your value:** The product is worth $100 to you.
* **Alice's offer:** Alice is selling the product for $90.
* **John's price:** John is selling the product for $100.

By accepting Alice's offer, you save $10 compared to buying from John.  This is the best outcome for you, as you are getting the product for a price that is lower than your value and lower than John's price."
