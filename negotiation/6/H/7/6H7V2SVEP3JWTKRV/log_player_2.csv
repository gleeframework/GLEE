``` 

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Price is right:** $145 is within your budget and a significant savings compared to Alice's initial offer and John's price.
* **""Final offer"" signal:** Alice stating this is her final offer suggests she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Time:** While you have rounds remaining, further haggling might not yield a better result and risks losing the deal altogether."
