Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a strong starting point that gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I receive significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, and I'm not willing to sell for that amount. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm countering with $850,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $750,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price. It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident I can still make a good profit.  Selling to John would only yield $800,000, so accepting Bob's offer is the better decision."
