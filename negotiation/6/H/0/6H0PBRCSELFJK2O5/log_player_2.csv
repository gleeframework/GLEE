{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is high, leaving room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount while still leaving room for further negotiation.  Offering $850,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price and represents a fair starting point for counteroffers.  This allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price. There are still several rounds left, and Bob can use this time to try and get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually lowering the price, while still leaving room for Alice to accept. $875,000 is a compromise between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate. This keeps the deal moving towards a potential agreement while maintaining a strong position for further negotiation."
