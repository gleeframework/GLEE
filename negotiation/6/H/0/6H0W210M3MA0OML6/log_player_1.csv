"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming to maximize my potential profit. This price is above Bob's perceived value, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate. I'm also leaving room for myself to make concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000.  This is still a bit above Bob's perceived value, but I'm hoping this is a more reasonable offer that he might be willing to accept.  It's also a bit below John's offer, so I'm still leaving myself some room to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower and lower, and while it is tempting to close the deal now, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This offer aligns with John's offer, so I'm confident that I won't lose out if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price.  I've already reached my limit and am not going to lower the price further.  John is a guaranteed sale at my desired price, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
