,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $10,500 for the product. This would still be a fantastic deal for you, considering its worth to you. Let's try to find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. While I appreciate your offer, I need to get at least $10,250 to make this deal worthwhile. This is a significant concession from my initial position, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. Let's make this happen!",10250.0,Alice,5,
