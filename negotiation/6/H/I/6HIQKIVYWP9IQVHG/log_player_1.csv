{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above our minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is a strong offer, giving Bob a significant discount while still securing a substantial profit for Alice.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept quicker.

**Important Note:** This offer balances risk and reward.  There's a chance Bob rejects the offer, leading to a sale at the $1,200,000 mark. However, the potential for a higher profit with Bob makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
