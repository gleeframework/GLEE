Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 allows room for potential negotiation (if Bob tries to counter-offer) while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Time Constraint:** The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiating style or financial limits. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, a slightly less aggressive opening price might be beneficial."
