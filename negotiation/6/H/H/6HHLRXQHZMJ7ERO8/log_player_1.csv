"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right person. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me; would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $130.  That's still a good price for you considering the value of the product, and it allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be a more attractive price to Bob while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with that price. I'll counteroffer once more and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still a little too low for me. How about we settle at $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm going to offer $125. This is my final offer, and it's a price that is still above my minimum while being more appealing to Bob than my previous offer. Hopefully, he will agree to this price, but if not, I'm prepared to sell the product to John."
