Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $105. It's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $105, and John offers the product for $100.  It makes more sense to take the guaranteed savings at this point."
