"Hi Alice, $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $10,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's close the deal at that price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
