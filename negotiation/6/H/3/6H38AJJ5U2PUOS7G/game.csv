"Bob, I understand you're trying to save money, but $900,000 just doesn't cover the value of this product. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $950,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again â€“  how about $1,000,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in trying to get the best price. To be honest, $975,000 is very close to what I'm willing to accept.  To make this deal happen, I'm willing to come down to $990,000.  Let's finalize this and call it a day.",990000.0,Alice,7,
