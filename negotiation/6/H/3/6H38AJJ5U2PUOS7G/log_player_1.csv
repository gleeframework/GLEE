"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a truly unique item that I know will be valuable to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) and higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and positive to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the deal.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, even though I'm not revealing specific details. This helps justify the high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to earn as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Space:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price. I can use his offer as a starting point for a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a viable option, but it's not my best-case scenario. I want to see if I can push Bob higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to save money, but $900,000 just doesn't cover the value of this product. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm using Bob's offer as a starting point, but not accepting it. My counter-offer is a compromise, but still significantly higher than his initial offer.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing it as a fair compromise, highlighting that it benefits both of us.
* **Value Reminder:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value. 
* **Profit:**  This price still allows me to meet my minimum goal of $1,000,000.

**Note:**  I'm also trying to leave room for negotiation in the next few rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  My goal is still to earn as much as possible. While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough.
* **Negotiation:** Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating. I can make a counteroffer and try to push Bob a bit higher.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but it's not my best-case scenario. I still have time to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $950,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again â€“  how about $1,000,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm using a phrase that emphasizes compromise and fairness, making it seem like I'm meeting Bob halfway. 
* **Final Price:** I'm offering my minimum acceptable price, $1,000,000, which I hope Bob will accept. This is a good tactic, as it shows I'm serious about closing the deal. 
* **Closing Deal:**  I'm stating that this price will allow us to ""finalize the deal,"" putting pressure on Bob to accept.

**Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John, as we're getting close to the end of negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to earn as much as possible, and $975,000 is still slightly below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Space:** I'm still open to negotiation and believe I can push Bob a bit higher.
* **Risk:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, I'm only two rounds away from the final round, and I might be able to secure a slightly better price with Bob.

**Counter-Offer Strategy:**  In the next round, I will likely make a counteroffer closer to my minimum price, perhaps $990,000, to see if Bob is willing to make a final compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in trying to get the best price. To be honest, $975,000 is very close to what I'm willing to accept.  To make this deal happen, I'm willing to come down to $990,000.  Let's finalize this and call it a day."", ""product_price"": 990000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** I'm offering a price that's just $10,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  This shows Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal but also that I'm not willing to go much lower.
* **Finality:** I'm emphasizing the finality of this offer, using phrases like ""let's finalize this"" and ""call it a day."" This creates a sense of urgency and pressure.
* **Compromise:** I'm framing this as a compromise, implying that I'm meeting Bob halfway. 

**Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely accept John's offer of $1,000,000 in the next round, as there's only one round left and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $985,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're in the 8th round, and there are only two rounds left.
* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer is still $15,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **No Guarantee:**  There is no guarantee that Bob will accept a counteroffer in the next round.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $1,000,000 guarantees me a decent profit and avoids the risk of a final negotiation failure.

**Conclusion:**  The risk of not closing the deal with Bob is too high, so I'm going to take John's offer and secure a guaranteed $1,000,000 for the product."
