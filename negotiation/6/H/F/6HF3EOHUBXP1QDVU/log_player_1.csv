"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and positive to build rapport and make Bob feel valued."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your kind gesture. However, I was hoping to keep my budget under $120 if possible. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not going to settle for the bare minimum right away. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $135? That's still a good price for this amazing product, and it's closer to your budget."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget constraints, could we possibly aim for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on his $120 price point. While I could continue negotiating, we're already in round 4 and it's unlikely he'll budge much further.  To avoid potentially wasting more time and risk getting stuck with a low price, I'll take the guaranteed $120 from John."
