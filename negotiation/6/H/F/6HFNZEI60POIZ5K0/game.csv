"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your perspective, but given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to that amount?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Could you consider a price closer to $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget, I am unable to meet you halfway at $18,000. I would like to propose a price of $15,000 for the product. This is the maximum I can afford while still maintaining my financial stability.",15000.0,Bob,4,
