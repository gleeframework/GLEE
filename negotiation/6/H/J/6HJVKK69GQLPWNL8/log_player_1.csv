Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is more than your minimum price of $8,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's potential for Bob to counteroffer, which allows for a back-and-forth that could ultimately result in a price closer to $15,000.
* **It's a fair starting point:**  It's not too aggressive, but it still shows you're serious about getting a good price.

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response!"
