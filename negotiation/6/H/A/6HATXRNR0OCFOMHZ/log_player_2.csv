Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $10,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm open to negotiation. How about $11,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,750 is still below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,250.  This way, we both get a good deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $11,250 is still too high for your budget.  At this point, it's better to take the sure thing and buy from John for $10,000.  You've made a good effort to negotiate with Alice, but you're running out of rounds and the price is getting closer to your limit."
