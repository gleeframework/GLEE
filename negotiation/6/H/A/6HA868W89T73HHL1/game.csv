"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's worth a lot to both of us, so I'm starting with a price of $900,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial deal.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you as well.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand that $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you as well.",800000.0,Bob,4,
