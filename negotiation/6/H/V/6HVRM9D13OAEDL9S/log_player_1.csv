"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,000,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to exploring possibilities that benefit both of us."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear less desperate.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" provides a reason for the high initial price, even though it's significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Openness:** Mentioning your willingness to explore other possibilities signals flexibility and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Safety Net:**  Remember, you always have the option to walk away and sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a significant jump from his initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  There's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if Bob will come closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. However,  $1,600,000 is still significantly below what I have in mind. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** It's important to acknowledge Bob's movement towards your asking price to keep the negotiation positive.
* **Standing Firm:** While showing flexibility,  I'm still holding firm above my minimum acceptable price to maximize potential profit.
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the ""true value"" reinforces the reason for the higher price without being overly aggressive.
* **Strategic Movement:**  I'm making a significant step down from my initial offer to signal a willingness to negotiate, but I'm leaving room for further bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above $1,800,000. I think this price better reflects the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or that further negotiation rounds will not result in a significantly better offer. Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of continuing the negotiation."
