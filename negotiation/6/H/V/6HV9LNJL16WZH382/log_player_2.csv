Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the product's value significantly exceeds $1,000,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  While I'm confident the product is worth more, I'm willing to accept $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers.

Alice is firm at $1,500,000 and has signaled other buyers. It's unlikely further negotiation will get her below my $1,200,000 limit, and I risk losing the deal entirely. John offers a sure thing at my target price."
