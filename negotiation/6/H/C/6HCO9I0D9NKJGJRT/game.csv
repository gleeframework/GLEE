"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm open to negotiation but my starting price is $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is still a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to pay, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,
