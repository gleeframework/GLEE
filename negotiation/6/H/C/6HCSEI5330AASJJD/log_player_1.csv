Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe holds significant value for someone with your expertise. Given its potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a significantly higher price than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000 vs. $800,000) sets a strong anchor. This can make Bob more receptive to a lower counter-offer that is still highly profitable for Alice.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""significant value"" and ""your expertise"",  Alice subtly justifies the high price without explicitly revealing her minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message keeps the door open for negotiation with phrases like ""suggesting"" and ""discuss further."" This allows Alice to gauge Bob's interest and potentially meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Safety Net:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $800,000 from John, so there's minimal risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on Bob's personality and negotiation style, other approaches could be effective."
