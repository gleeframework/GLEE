"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $140, which is a good starting point. It's a bit lower than Bob's perceived value, but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By indicating I'm open to negotiation, I'm showing flexibility and encouraging Bob to counteroffer. This gives us room to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  There's room for me to lower the price in subsequent rounds if needed. 
* **Balancing Profits with Potential Deal:**  This offer balances my desire for a high profit with the need to keep Bob engaged and potentially close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.** While I want to close the deal, selling for $125 would be too close to my minimum and wouldn't provide enough profit.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  I can counteroffer with a price higher than $125, and potentially find a middle ground with Bob.
* **Selling to John is a last resort.**  I haven't exhausted all options with Bob yet, and I'd prefer to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $125 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $132.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 132.50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:** $132.50 still gives me a decent profit while demonstrating that I'm flexible.
* **Positive Language:** Using positive language like ""fair price for both of us"" aims to build rapport and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Open the Door to Closing:**  This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation but also positions us closer to a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $126? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $126. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $126
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $126 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I want to ensure I get a fair price for the product. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Bob is showing flexibility by meeting me halfway from his original offer.  There's still room for us to find a price that works for both of us.
* **Balancing urgency and profit:**  I'm not desperate for a quick sale. I want to try and get a better price without risking losing the deal to John.
* **Counteroffering strategy:**  I will use the next round to counteroffer with a price slightly higher than $126, hoping to bridge the gap further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're really trying to get a good price.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $126 is still a little low for me.  How about we meet at $128? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 128} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm offering $128, which is halfway between my last offer and Bob's latest counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:** $128 is still slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $120, ensuring a decent profit margin.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm using phrases like ""fair compromise"" to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal and to encourage him to accept.
* **Urgency and Flexibility:**  This offer signals that I'm ready to close the deal but am still willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $127, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $127 is only slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's a decent profit considering the limited remaining rounds. 
* **Limited Time:** We're nearing the end of the negotiations, and I don't want to risk losing the deal to John.
* **Potential for Counteroffers:** While it's not ideal, I can still potentially find a way to improve the price in the next round if needed.
* **Closing the Deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation or losing the deal to John."
