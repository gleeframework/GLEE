"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me at that price?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $125 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $132.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $126?",126.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're really trying to get a good price.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $126 is still a little low for me.  How about we meet at $128? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",128.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $127, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",127.0,Bob,6,
