"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $150 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. This is the lowest I can go.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, $110 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you consider $90? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $90, which is $100. That's the lowest I can go.",100.0,Alice,5,
