"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate the counteroffer. However, $85 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $87.50? This way, we both get a fair price.",87.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to go up to $86.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",86.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $86 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $88.  This feels like a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",88.0,Alice,5,
