"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the price as ""fair,"" subtly implying that there's room for compromise.
* **Open-Ended:** I'm asking for Bob's thoughts, encouraging him to engage in the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to set the initial terms favorably while also inviting Bob to participate in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a better option.
* **We have 8 rounds remaining.**  There is still time to negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the power in my hands.** This allows me to set the terms of the next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's continue to work together."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable decrease:** I'm dropping the price, but not by a large margin. This shows willingness to compromise while maintaining my position.
* **Reiterate value and mutual benefit:** I'm highlighting the product's value and emphasizing the possibility of a good deal for both parties.
* **Keep the dialogue open:** I'm encouraging Bob to continue the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.** Even though he's increased his offer, it's not enough to meet my needs.
* **Selling to John for $1,500,000 remains the better option.** This offers a significant profit.
* **We have 6 rounds left.** There's still room for negotiation, and I can potentially push for a higher price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control and can leverage my position in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too far below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,100,000. This price is fair considering its value, and I believe it's in both our interests to reach an agreement. Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to compromise:**  I'm dropping my price again, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Maintain leverage:**  My offer is still above Bob's current offer, keeping some bargaining power.
* **Highlight fairness and mutual benefit:** I'm reiterating the value of the product and emphasizing the potential for both parties to benefit from a deal.
* **Encourage further negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for continued discussions and aiming for a resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but so does my budget.  I can go up to $975,000, but that's my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are down to 4 rounds left, and Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.
* **John's offer is considerably higher:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures a substantial profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation with Bob.
* **The potential gains from further negotiation are small:** While there's a chance I might squeeze out a slightly higher price from Bob, the risk of ending up with a lower offer or running out of time is too great.

Given the circumstances, selling to John is the most logical and advantageous decision at this point."
