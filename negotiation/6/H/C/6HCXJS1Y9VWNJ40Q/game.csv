"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's continue to work together.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. Let me know if that works for you.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too far below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,100,000. This price is fair considering its value, and I believe it's in both our interests to reach an agreement. Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
