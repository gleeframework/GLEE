Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1 million, as a starting point. This allows for some room for negotiation and still ensures I'm making a significant profit.  I'll be watching closely to see how Bob reacts, and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000.  This shows I'm willing to compromise but still maintains a healthy profit for me. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm ready to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more,  $920,000 is a solid price, especially considering the possibility that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate. It's important to recognize that a deal is better than no deal, and this price ensures I'm still getting a significant return on my investment."
