"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. How about we meet in the middle at $115?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $115 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $105.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I will reject Bob's offer. While it is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still confident I can negotiate a better deal. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a few more rounds before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? This is a fair compromise that's still within my price range.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
