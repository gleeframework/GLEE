"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me there?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? That seems like a fair price considering the value of the product.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm happy to keep working with you, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this work, I need to be at $100.  This is a great product and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're confident in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $95, so I'm offering $97.50. This is my final offer.",97.5,Bob,6,
