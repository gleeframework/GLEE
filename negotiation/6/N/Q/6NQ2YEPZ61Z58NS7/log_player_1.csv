Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum value, but it's not so high that Bob will immediately reject it. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm counter-offering with $9,500. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate while still trying to get a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $9,200 is significantly higher than my minimum value and selling to John.  At this point, the negotiation is becoming time-consuming and there's no guarantee I can get a better deal.  It's time to secure the sale."
