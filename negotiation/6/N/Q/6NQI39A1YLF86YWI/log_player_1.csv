Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. However, I am interested in discussing this further. Could you consider lowering the price to $130?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price, especially since Bob has shown interest in negotiating further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $135? It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 135}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is $130, which is just above my minimum. While I would prefer more, I've had several rounds of negotiation and I'm concerned about running out of time and having to sell to John for a lower price. Therefore, I'll accept Bob's offer."
