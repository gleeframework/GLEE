"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $9000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of my own. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my minimum price. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10800. This is a compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the product's value to you.
