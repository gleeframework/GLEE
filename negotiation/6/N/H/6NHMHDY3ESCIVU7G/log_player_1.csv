Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully leaves a significant profit margin. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider his counteroffer and whether it's worthwhile to continue negotiating with him or to accept the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. While I hoped for a higher price, selling to Bob for $800,000 guarantees my minimum profit and avoids further negotiation."
