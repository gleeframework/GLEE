Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $15,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down if he finds the price too high. This increases the chances of closing a deal above $10,000.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob without being overly aggressive. 
 
**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's financial situation or how much he might be willing to pay. Gathering more information about potential buyers can lead to even more effective pricing strategies."
