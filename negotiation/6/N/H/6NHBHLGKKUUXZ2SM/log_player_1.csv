Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $99 is a good starting point. It's a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price but still significantly above Bob's perceived value. This gives you room to negotiate if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Positive Messaging:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing a ""special price"" and a ""great deal"" to entice Bob.
