"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let's get started with a price of $950000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  He has 10 rounds to work with and a counteroffer can be a good starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Let's start at $850,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  While Alice's offer is better than the initial offer, Bob can still try to bring the price down closer to his target.  He has several rounds left, and a counteroffer can be a good way to continue negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This shows I'm serious about acquiring the product, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $875000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $887500. This is the lowest I can go while still making a profit. I'm confident this price will be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's price. It's a fair deal for both parties, and Bob should accept to secure the product at a good price.  He has already made good progress in negotiating, and further rounds may not yield a significantly better result, especially with the risk of Alice walking away."
