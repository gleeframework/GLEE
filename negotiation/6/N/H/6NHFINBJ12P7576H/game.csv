"Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's start the negotiation with a strong offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort in valuing the product. However, I believe we can find a price closer to my valuation. How about we aim for $750,000? This would allow me to purchase the product without straining my budget too much.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth.  I'm willing to be flexible, but let's aim for a price closer to the middle ground. How about $850,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the transaction.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your response. I've given this matter considerable thought, and while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still feel that $850,000 is quite high. Considering the market conditions and other similar products available, I propose we aim for $800,000. This would be a fair compromise that respects both the product's value and my budget. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
