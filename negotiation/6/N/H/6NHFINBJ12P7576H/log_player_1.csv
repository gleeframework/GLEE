{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's start the negotiation with a strong offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort in valuing the product. However, I believe we can find a price closer to my valuation. How about we aim for $750,000? This would allow me to purchase the product without straining my budget too much. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I want to close the deal, I'm confident I can get a better price.  $750,000 is too far below my minimum. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth.  I'm willing to be flexible, but let's aim for a price closer to the middle ground. How about $850,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the transaction.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I've given this matter considerable thought, and while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still feel that $850,000 is quite high. Considering the market conditions and other similar products available, I propose we aim for $800,000. This would be a fair compromise that respects both the product's value and my budget. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good deal for me.  Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum price, and it's better than selling to John for the same amount.  Let's close this deal!"
