"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $9,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $7,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,5,
