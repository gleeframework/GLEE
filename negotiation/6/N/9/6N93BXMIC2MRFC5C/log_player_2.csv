"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you and we're looking to maximize our earnings. Let's start with an offer of $95 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You want to save as much money as possible, and $95 is still above your desired price point.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to buy your product, but $95 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85, which is still a good deal for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering our goal to maximize earnings, how about $90 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You should reject Alice's offer. While $90 is better than her initial offer, you can still try to negotiate a lower price. You're aiming for $85, and you still have several rounds left to try to reach that goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $90 is closer, I'm still hoping to get the product for $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see your point, Bob. Let's try $88 for the product. This brings us closer to your offer while still allowing us to achieve a satisfactory profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer.  $88 is a good price for you, given your goal of paying no more than $100. You've already rejected a few offers, and it's getting close to the point where it might be more worthwhile to buy from John. This offer is a solid compromise, and you can secure the product at a price you're comfortable with."
