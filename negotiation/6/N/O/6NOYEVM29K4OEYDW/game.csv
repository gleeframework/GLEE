"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $950,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. Can we discuss further?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $937,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.",937500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not sure I can meet you at $937,500. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider meeting me there?",920000.0,Bob,6,
