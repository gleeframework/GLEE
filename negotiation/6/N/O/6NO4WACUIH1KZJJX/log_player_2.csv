"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is a bit high. While you're willing to pay up to $12,000, you can try to get a better price by rejecting her initial offer. This might lead Alice to propose a lower price, or you can always fall back on buying from John at your maximum budget."
