"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:**  $130, which is still above your maximum budget of $150.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. Even if Alice rejects your first counteroffer, it will give you more information and potentially lead to a better deal in later rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer. While the product seems interesting, $130 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  I've made a significant counteroffer, aiming to quickly establish a lower price point. 
* **Justification:** I've provided a reason for my counteroffer (price range) to make it seem more reasonable. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for further discussion and potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $125. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $125, which is still above my maximum budget of $150. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** It's worth trying to negotiate further, even though we're getting close to my limit.  There's still a potential to get a better deal. 
* **John's Offer:**  While $150 is my limit, I'd prefer to avoid that if possible, as I could still save $25."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $125. How about we split the difference and settle on $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy it."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise, aiming to find a middle ground. 
* **Fairness:** I emphasize ""fair price for both of us"" to appeal to Alice's sense of reason. 
* **Finality:** This is likely my final offer, as it's close to my limit. If Alice rejects, I'll likely turn to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to meet you at $123. It's a small step closer to your original offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $123. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $123
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $123 is within my budget and only $3 more than my previous counteroffer. 
* **Value:**  While I'd prefer to pay less, Alice has shown some flexibility and I'm likely not going to get much lower.
* **John's Offer:**  While I could go to John, it's not worth the extra $13 to avoid a little more negotiation. 
* **Risk:** Continuing to negotiate could result in Alice getting frustrated and walking away, forcing me to buy from John at a higher price."
