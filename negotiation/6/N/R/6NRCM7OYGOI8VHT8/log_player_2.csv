"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far more than he's willing to pay, and he has other options.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,500 at this point. This is my absolute maximum."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I can go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still a bit high. Bob should continue negotiating to try to get a better price. He has time and other options, so he shouldn't feel pressured to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $9,500, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is my final compromise. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is getting closer to his budget, he still has the option to buy from John for $8,000. He should continue negotiating and see if he can get Alice to come down further.  There's still room for compromise, and he has time on his side."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $10,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $11,500. This is as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John.  At this point, Alice has made it clear she won't go lower than $11,500. That's more than Bob is willing to pay, and he's running out of time.  John is offering the product for a price that's within Bob's budget. It's time to move on and secure the product at a reasonable price."
