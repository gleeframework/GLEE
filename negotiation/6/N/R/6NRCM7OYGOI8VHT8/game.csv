"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,500 at this point. This is my absolute maximum.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I can go any lower. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $9,500, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is my final compromise. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $10,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $11,500. This is as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",11500.0,Alice,7,
