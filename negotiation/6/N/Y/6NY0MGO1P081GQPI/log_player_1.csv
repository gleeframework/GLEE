"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum acceptable value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value for Bob:**  $14,000 is still significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob ($8,000), making it a potentially attractive deal. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** This initial offer allows for multiple rounds of negotiation without immediately hitting my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me.
* **John's offer:** While John's offer is appealing, I still have 8 rounds left with Bob, and there's potential to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer is a significant reduction from my initial $14,000, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above my minimum:** $12,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise further."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  Rejecting allows me to make another counteroffer that's closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer:**  While tempting, I'm still 6 rounds away from a deal with Bob.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price before I have to sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:**  This offer is a slight reduction from my previous $12,000, demonstrating a continued willingness to negotiate.
* **Approaching my minimum:**  $11,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Increasing pressure:** By offering a slightly lower price, I'm putting more pressure on Bob to accept, as it's getting closer to his perceived value of the product."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $10,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Room for improvement:** There are still 4 rounds left, and I believe there's room for further negotiation to reach a price closer to my goal. 
* **John's offer:**  While John's offer is tempting, I'm still optimistic about negotiating a better price with Bob."

Round 7

{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer is a further reduction from my previous $11,500, showing a strong willingness to negotiate and close the deal.
* **Approaching My Floor:** While still above my minimum, $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only 3 rounds remaining, I'm putting pressure on Bob to accept, as this may be his last chance to get the product at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  With only 2 rounds left, I'm unlikely to get a better offer from Bob. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, which is significantly higher than what Bob is currently offering. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of ending up with a lower price or no deal at all.  Selling to John eliminates this risk and ensures a guaranteed profit."
