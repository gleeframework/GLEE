Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,800,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but $1,650,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the product's value while remaining within my budget. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my minimum acceptable price, I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.  It's not worth the risk of Bob not meeting my minimum within the remaining rounds. Accepting John's offer ensures I get a fair price without further negotiation."
