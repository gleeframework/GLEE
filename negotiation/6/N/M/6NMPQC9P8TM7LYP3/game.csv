"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,800,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is a significant gap from my initial asking price. The value this product brings is truly unique.  Would you be willing to consider $1,650,000? This demonstrates a willingness to meet closer to the middle ground while still reflecting the product's inherent value.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but $1,650,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the product's value while remaining within my budget. Let's close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
