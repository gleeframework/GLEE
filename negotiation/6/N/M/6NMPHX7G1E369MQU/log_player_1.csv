"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $18,000 for it. It's a great deal considering its value."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to create a sense of desirability. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By setting the price at $18,000, I'm anticipating a counteroffer and allowing for a potential negotiation.

This strategy balances the need to get a good price with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer. I'm confident that I can still secure a deal within the 10 rounds, and if not, I have the option of selling to John for my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000 and far below the initial offer I made. Accepting this offer would be a huge loss.
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:** I'm confident I can secure a better price through further negotiation.  While I'm willing to sell to John for $15,000, I'm not desperate and will continue to try to get a better price from Bob.

**Next Step:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price that's still higher than his $8,000 offer but closer to my minimum desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $13,000? I'm flexible and willing to work with you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm counter-offering with a price that is still above Bob's offer but significantly lower than my initial asking price. 
* **Compromise:** I'm emphasizing my willingness to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiating. 

**Strategy:** I'm aiming to move the negotiation closer to my desired price point while still leaving room for potential further negotiation in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $13,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we settle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $9,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $15,000.  While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, I can't afford to sell for that low of a price.
* **More room for negotiation:**  We've only had a few rounds of negotiation. I'm confident I can still get a better price from Bob by continuing to counter-offer.

**Next Step:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my desired price point. I want to create a sense of urgency by emphasizing that we are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close to the end of our negotiation time.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but that's my final offer.  I really believe this product is worth it to you. Let's close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Creating Urgency:**  I'm highlighting the limited time remaining to encourage Bob to take my offer seriously.
* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm emphasizing the importance of reaching an agreement in this round.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:** 
I'm pushing for a price closer to my minimum while acknowledging that we're nearing the end of the negotiation. If Bob still rejects, I'll consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to close the deal right now if you'll accept $9,500.  That's the most I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still below my minimum desired price of $15,000.  Accepting this offer would be a significant loss for me.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** We only have 4 rounds left.  While I'm willing to sell to John, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Step:** I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum to see if I can push Bob to a more agreeable price point before I have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to work with you. But $9,500 is just not enough for me. I'm ready to close the deal right now for $10,500. That's my very last offer before I have to consider other options.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm reiterating that this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency.
* **Slight Compromise:** I'm offering a slight compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum desired price.
* **Emphasize Options:** I'm reminding Bob that I have other options to encourage him to accept this offer.
* **Positive but Firm:** I'm maintaining a positive tone but also being firm about my price.

**Strategy:** 
I'm pushing for a price closer to my minimum while leaving room for a potential counteroffer from Bob. If he rejects again, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
