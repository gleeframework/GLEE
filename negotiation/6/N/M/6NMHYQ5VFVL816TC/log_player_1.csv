{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm asking for $1,750,000. Given its potential, I believe it's a very competitive price."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and it's worth the same to me, starting with a price of $1,750,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob's business justifies the high asking price. 
* **Alternative:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John) gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell below that price.

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. If he rejects the initial offer, I can gradually lower the price during negotiation, knowing my minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000."
