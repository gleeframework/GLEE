"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with a strong offer.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $900,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm going to offer you the product for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I think this is a great compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to work with me. I understand this is your bottom line, but I can't quite meet that number. My final offer is $750,000. If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
