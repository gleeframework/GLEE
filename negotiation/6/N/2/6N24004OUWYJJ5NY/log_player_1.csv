"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more reasonable, considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting, it's still below my minimum price point. I believe there's room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, recognizing your interest in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. I think that's a fair price, considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm still aiming for a higher price than Bob's current offer. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but I'm not ready to sell for $1,250,000 yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,280,000. This price is a fair compromise considering the product's value and our ongoing negotiations. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1280000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,220,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that buying from John might be a better option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offer is too low, and he's starting to threaten to go to another buyer. I'm not willing to risk losing the deal entirely for a few hundred thousand dollars. It's better to secure a sale with John for $1,000,000 than to risk getting nothing."
