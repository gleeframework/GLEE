"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I do see the potential value in this product, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is my maximum.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your increased offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm willing to meet you at $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
