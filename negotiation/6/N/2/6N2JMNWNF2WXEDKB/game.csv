"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $950000?  This would allow both of us to get a good deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try to get closer to my original offer of $900000? I'm willing to go up to $925000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",925000.0,Bob,4,
