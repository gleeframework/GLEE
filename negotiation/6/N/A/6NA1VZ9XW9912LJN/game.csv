"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its value.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for us, the $950,000 price point doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice. However, given my financial situation and the market value of similar products, I believe $950,000 was already a reasonable compromise. I am unable to increase my offer further. I would like to stick at $950,000 for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
