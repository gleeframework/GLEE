"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is just not going to work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still asking $9,000.  It's a great deal for you and it's a fair price for me. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer, but $9,000 is still a little steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
