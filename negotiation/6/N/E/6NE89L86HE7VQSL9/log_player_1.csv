Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $11,500 is higher than your minimum desired price of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** $11,500 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $12,000, giving him room to negotiate if he wants to.
* **It's not too aggressive:** A higher offer might scare Bob away, making him less likely to negotiate. 

By starting with a reasonable offer, you can open a dialogue with Bob and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is only slightly lower than your minimum desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get closer to your ideal price of $11,500 by rejecting his offer and making a counter-offer. 

By rejecting, you demonstrate that you're not willing to settle for the minimum and that you believe the product is worth more. This can encourage Bob to come up with a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being interested in the product. $10,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and I think we can both be happy with this price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise, but not by too much.  It's a halfway point between your previous offer and Bob's.
* **Positive Framing:**  Highlighting the value for Bob (""great deal"") helps him see the benefit of accepting.
* **Keeps the negotiation going:**  This counteroffer keeps the conversation open and allows for potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,750 is a good compromise.  It's higher than John's offer of $10,000, and it's getting closer to your desired price.  While you might be able to squeeze out a bit more, continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale entirely.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures you get a good price and avoid potential complications."
