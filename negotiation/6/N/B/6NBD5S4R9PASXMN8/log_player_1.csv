Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want at least $12,000, and this offer is higher.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's space for him to counter without you feeling pressured to accept a low price.
* **It's a fair initial offer:** It's not too aggressive, and it shows that you're open to negotiation. 

Remember, your goal is to get as much money as possible, but also to keep the negotiation open and potentially get a higher price than John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. 

* **Rejecting allows for further negotiation:** By rejecting, you signal that you're not willing to settle for his initial counteroffer. This can prompt him to increase his offer or at least open the door for further negotiation.
* **John is a safety net:**  You have the option to sell to John for $12,000, so you're not at risk of losing out completely. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, you have the opportunity to increase the price and maximize your earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250? I'm confident you'll still find this a good deal, and it gives me a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This shows a willingness to compromise while still getting a price closer to your desired range.
* **Highlighting the value:**  ""I'm confident you'll still find this a good deal"" emphasizes the product's value to Bob. 
* **Staying above your minimum:** $13,250 is significantly higher than John's offer, making this a more desirable option.

By offering a counteroffer that's fair but still within your desired range, you're showing Bob that you're serious about getting a good price while remaining open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:** Bob's offer is only $750 away from your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  It's unlikely you'll get much higher than this. 
* **John's offer is lower:** Accepting Bob's offer means you'll earn $750 more than you would by selling to John.

While you'd ideally prefer a higher price, it's important to balance potential gains with the risk of further negotiation.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale at a price that's within your acceptable range and is better than John's offer."
