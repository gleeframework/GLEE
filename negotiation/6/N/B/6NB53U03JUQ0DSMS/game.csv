"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant opportunity for you, as you know this product is worth much more to you than the asking price. I believe this is a fair starting point, given the value you'll derive from it.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand this product is valuable, but your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $1,100,000 is still significantly below what I need to accept. To continue this negotiation, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still reflects the value you'll receive, and allows us to move towards a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, there's still a significant gap between our positions. To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to offer $1,200,000. This reflects my serious interest in the product while acknowledging the need for a fair deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,200,000 still doesn't reflect the true value this product holds for you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and offer the product for $1,250,000.  This is a fair price, given the significant benefits you'll receive from it.  Let's close this deal and get the product in your hands.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
