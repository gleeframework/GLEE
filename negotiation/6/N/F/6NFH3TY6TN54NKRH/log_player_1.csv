{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $175 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message and sets a price that is higher than your minimum but still potentially attractive to Bob. It allows for some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $145 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below your minimum acceptable price. It's worth trying to get a bit closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. How about we meet in the middle at $155? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $140 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
