"Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:

You can likely get a better deal than $750,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $700,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Let's see if she's willing to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down a bit. While $725,000 is still more than I initially hoped for, it's a good compromise. It's less than what John would charge, and buying from Alice avoids the risk of negotiations dragging on."
