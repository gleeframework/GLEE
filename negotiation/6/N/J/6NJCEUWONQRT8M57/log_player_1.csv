Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think it's worth $18,000 to you, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $16,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I think the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum threshold. This gives him room to negotiate. 
* **Building value:** I'm framing the message to highlight the product's value to Bob, which might influence his decision.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiating, which could keep Bob engaged.

**Important Note:**  This is a risky strategy. While it has the potential for higher profit, there's a greater chance Bob will reject the offer. If he does, I'll need to be prepared to counter and decide whether to stick with my minimum price or lower it slightly.  I'll also need to consider the time cost of negotiation vs. selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $14,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's offer of $14,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob is clearly interested in the product, so I'm willing to counter with a price closer to my minimum.
* **Time vs. potential profit:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed sale, I'm willing to risk some time and continue negotiations with Bob to potentially earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $15,500? This would give you a good deal on the product, and I'd still be able to make a fair profit. "", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by dropping my price from $16,000 to $15,500, but I'm still above my minimum threshold.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing that $15,500 is a good deal for Bob, highlighting the value of the product and potentially influencing his decision.
* **Focusing on a win-win:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win for both of us, aiming to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Pressure on Bob:**  This counteroffer puts a little pressure on Bob, as he knows that if he rejects it, he might risk losing the product entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $14,500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $14,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. However, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation.
* **Time is a factor:**  The negotiation process has taken some time, and I'm concerned about the opportunity cost of continuing.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John for $15,000 ensures a guaranteed profit and minimizes my risk.
* **Potential for higher offers:**  While I'm confident in the value of the product, there's no guarantee that I can get a better price from Bob. 

I'm choosing to sell to John to secure a fair deal and avoid the potential for further delays and a lower price."
