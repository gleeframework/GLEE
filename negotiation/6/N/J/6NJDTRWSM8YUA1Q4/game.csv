"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $11,500?  That's a significant jump from my previous offer and gets us closer to a deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $13,500. This is a small step back from my previous offer, but still a good deal considering its value to you is $12,000.
