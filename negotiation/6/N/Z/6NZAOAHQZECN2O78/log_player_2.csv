"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $110. This is a good deal, but you can likely get it for less. 
* **Negotiation:** You have 10 rounds and the opportunity to make counteroffers. This gives you leverage to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it.  $110 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** The offer of $95 is still a good deal for Alice as the product is only worth $80 to her.  
* **Leverage:**  I'm making it clear that I'm serious about buying the product but that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice has come down to $100, which is closer to my desired price, but I can still do better.
* **Negotiation:** I have 7 more rounds to work with, and I can continue to make counteroffers.
* **Potential:** Alice is showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, which suggests there's room for further compromise.  

I'll counter with a slightly higher offer, aiming to meet closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $100 is a step in the right direction. I'm still hoping to get a better price though. Let's split the difference - how about $97.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering a price that's a bit closer to Alice's last offer but still lower, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Fairness:**  This price is still a good deal for Alice as it's well above her value of $80. 
* **Leverage:**  I'm making it clear that I am serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. This approach helps maintain momentum in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $99. Let's shake on it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is now offering it for $99. This is a significant savings compared to my initial budget. 
* **Negotiation:** While I could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice backing out or me running out of rounds and having to buy from John for $120 is high. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential savings of a few more dollars are not worth the risk of losing the deal or having to pay a higher price. 

It's a good deal for both of us, and it's time to finalize the purchase."
