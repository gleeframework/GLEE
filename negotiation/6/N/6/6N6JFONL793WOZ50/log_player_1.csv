Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a strong offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that you value the product highly. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but well above your minimum ($1,000,000). This aims to maximize your potential profit while still being attractive to Bob. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind that you have John as a backup buyer. While Bob is your preferred buyer due to the higher potential profit, you're not desperate and can walk away if negotiations aren't favorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,075,000, but I'd love to see if we can get even closer to the price I'm looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is significantly below your target price and even dips closer to your minimum. While meeting in the middle might seem tempting, there's still room for negotiation. You'll counter to guide the price upwards."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,120,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", ""product_price"": 1120000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate but not at the expense of undervaluing the product.
* **Justification:**  You're providing a reason for the higher price, emphasizing the inherent value of the product.
* **Strategic Movement:**  While you're not drastically changing your price, you are moving closer to Bob's offer, indicating a willingness to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product is worth a lot, but I've done my research and I believe it's not worth more than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,075,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can we meet in the middle at $1,062,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob hasn't met your ideal price, his latest offer is reasonably close to your minimum threshold. Continuing negotiations might yield a slightly higher offer, but there's also a risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a profit of $62,500, which is a good outcome considering your fallback option is selling to John for a $1,000,000."
