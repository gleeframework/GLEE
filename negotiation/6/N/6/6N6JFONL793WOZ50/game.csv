"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,075,000, but I'd love to see if we can get even closer to the price I'm looking for.",1075000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,120,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1120000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you think the product is worth a lot, but I've done my research and I believe it's not worth more than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,075,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can we meet in the middle at $1,062,500?",1062500.0,Bob,4,
