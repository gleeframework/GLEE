"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still find great value in the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I can't go as low as $8750, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $8875? It's a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal.  Let's make this happen!",8875.0,Alice,5,
