"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $925,000? It's a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $910,000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",910000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $910,000 is a good offer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $915,000.  This is my final offer. If you're not able to meet that, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  Let me know your decision.",915000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to stick with my previous counteroffer of $910,000. I think it's a fair price for the product, and I'm not willing to go any higher. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",910000.0,Bob,6,
