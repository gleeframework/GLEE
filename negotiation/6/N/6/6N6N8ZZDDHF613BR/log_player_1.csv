{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer:

* **Starts high:** It's close to my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justifies the price:**  It mentions the value to both of us, hoping to make Bob feel like it's a good deal.
* **Leaves room for counteroffers:**  Bob may counter, and I can adjust if necessary. 
* **Keeps John in mind:** I have a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but still lower:** While $900,000 is better than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000.
* **There's still room for negotiation:** I can counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is always an option:** I have a backup buyer who will pay my minimum value. 

**Next Move:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $925,000? It's a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 925000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I've raised the price slightly from Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **Compromise:**  The message emphasizes that this is a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal.
* **Positive tone:** I keep the conversation friendly and encourage continued negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

* **Keep the pressure on:** I want Bob to understand that I'm still aiming for a higher price.
* **Maintain a balance:** I don't want to push Bob too hard and risk losing him completely.
* **Open for negotiation:**  I'm still willing to negotiate, leaving room for a possible agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $910,000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is getting closer, but still below my minimum:**  $910,000 is only $90,000 away from my minimum value. However, I'm not desperate to sell and have a better offer from John.
* **The negotiation is getting tense:**  We're both getting close to our limits, so pushing further might lead to a stalemate.
* **John's offer remains the most attractive:**  He's willing to pay my minimum, which is more than Bob.

**Next Move:**

I will counteroffer Bob again, but this time I will be more firm. I will aim for a price closer to $920,000. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $910,000 is a good offer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $915,000.  This is my final offer. If you're not able to meet that, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 915000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:**  This emphasizes that I'm not willing to negotiate further.
* **Pressure:**  This message puts the pressure on Bob to either accept or move on.
* **Realistic Compromise:**  The price is still higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.

**Reasoning:**

* **Reduce Risk:**  By making this my ""final offer,"" I reduce the risk of a prolonged negotiation.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  I'm still holding out for a better price, but not pushing Bob too far.
* **Prepare for John:**  If Bob rejects, I'm ready to move to John and secure my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to stick with my previous counteroffer of $910,000. I think it's a fair price for the product, and I'm not willing to go any higher. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  We've reached an impasse, and both of us are firm on our final offers. 
* **John's Offer is More Lucrative:**  John is willing to pay my minimum value of $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's final offer of $910,000.
* **Minimize Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing both deals, as he may walk away entirely.

**Conclusion:**

I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. While I would have preferred to sell to Bob at a higher price, the risk of a failed negotiation and a lower profit outweighs the potential gains from further bargaining with Bob."
