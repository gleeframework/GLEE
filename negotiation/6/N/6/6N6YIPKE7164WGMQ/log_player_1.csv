Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $100.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John.
* **Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below your minimum ($150) at $145 creates a sense of a deal for Bob while maximizing your potential profit.  

If Bob rejects the offer, you still have the security of selling to John at your minimum acceptable price."
