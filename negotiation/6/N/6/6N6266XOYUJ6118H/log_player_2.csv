"Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I will reject Alice's offer because it is higher than my budget of $120. I will also choose to reject it because I can get the product from John for $120, which is a better deal.
