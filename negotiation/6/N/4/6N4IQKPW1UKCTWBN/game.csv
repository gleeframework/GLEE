,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 just doesn't work for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $75 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's make this happen!",85.0,Alice,5,
