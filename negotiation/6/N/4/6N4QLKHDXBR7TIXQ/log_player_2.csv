Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can consider a price of $11000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
