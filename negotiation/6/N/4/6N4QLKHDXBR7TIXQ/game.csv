"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can consider a price of $11000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $8500.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $10500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm not sure I'm willing to go any lower. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
