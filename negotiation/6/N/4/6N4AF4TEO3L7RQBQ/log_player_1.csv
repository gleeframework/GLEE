Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This would still be a good deal for both of us, as I'm sure you value this product even higher. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
