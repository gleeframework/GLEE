"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in pursuing. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still $200,000 more than your maximum value. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still $150,000 above my maximum value.  I'm willing to pay more than John's price, but there's still room to negotiate and save more.  Rejecting the offer gives me another chance to make a counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000? That would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it would allow me to secure the product within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,100,000, so I'm offering you the product for $1,125,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still $125,000 above my maximum value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm starting to feel like it's taking too long, and I'm not sure we'll get to a price I'm comfortable with.  It's better to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  It's the best price I've been offered, and it saves me time and effort."
