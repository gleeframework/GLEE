"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in pursuing.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This would still be a good deal for both of us, as I'm sure you value this product even higher. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000? That would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it would allow me to secure the product within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,100,000, so I'm offering you the product for $1,125,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
