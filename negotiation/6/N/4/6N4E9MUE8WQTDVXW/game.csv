"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you say?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? I'm happy to buy the product at that price, but I can't go any higher.",100.0,Bob,4,
