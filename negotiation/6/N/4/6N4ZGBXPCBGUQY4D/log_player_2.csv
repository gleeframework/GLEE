"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be fair to propose a price of $9,500 for this exceptional item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While $9,500 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get it for even less by negotiating. There are still 9 rounds left, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore further price reductions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your consideration. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of this, I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for the product. This offer reflects a compromise between our positions, aiming to be fair for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible.  $9,000 is still above his ideal price point, and there are 7 rounds left to try and get a better offer.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm happy to offer $8,750.  This represents a significant step towards a deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his ideal price point, but with 5 rounds left, there's still room to potentially squeeze out a bit more. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to explore a slightly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $8,900 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to reach a price of $8,800. This would be a fair compromise and allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest proposal, Bob. I've considered your request and am willing to agree on a price of $8,850 for the product. This offer aims to be fair and reasonable for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has negotiated a price very close to his goal. With only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of continuing is high. There's a chance that Alice might not budge further, and Bob might end up buying from John for $10,000.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a significant discount compared to John and saves time and potential further negotiation headaches."
