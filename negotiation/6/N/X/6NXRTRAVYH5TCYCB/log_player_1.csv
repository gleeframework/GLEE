Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob if he tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties adds a level of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
