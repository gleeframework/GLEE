"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than $10,000. Considering its worth to both of us, let's start our negotiation at $15,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, as that's my maximum. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product, I am willing to lower the price to $14,000. This still reflects a premium price, but I believe it's a fair compromise given our negotiation thus far.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $10,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we continue to work together.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see your point, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. I propose we set the price at $13,000 for the product. This is still higher than your initial offer but closer to what you're willing to pay. I believe this could be a satisfactory solution for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $13,000 is still too much for me.  I'm confident that $10,000 is a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Considering our previous discussions, I believe we can come to an agreement. I propose setting the price at $12,500 for the product. This is slightly above your initial offer but still below my initial asking price. I think this could be a fair compromise that allows us to move forward with the transaction.",12500.0,Alice,7,
