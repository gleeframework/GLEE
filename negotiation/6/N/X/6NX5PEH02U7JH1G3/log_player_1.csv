Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $100. This means any price above $100 is beneficial to him.
* **My Floor:** I won't sell for less than $150 because John is willing to pay that.
* **Negotiation:** Offering $140 gives Bob a $40 discount on the price John is offering. It's a good deal for him, and I get $10 more than my floor.

This strategy aims to maximize profit by aiming for a price that is attractive to Bob but still significantly above my minimum acceptable value."
