Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $150. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and potential for negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob."
