{""product_price"": 18000}

I'm starting with a high price of $18,000.  This is my initial attempt to maximize my profit. I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, so this gives me some room to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $15,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this price is appealing enough to Bob that he'll accept, but still allows me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is too low.  I'm not willing to go that low. While I could counteroffer again, I'm concerned that Bob might continue to lowball me. I'd rather sell to John and get a guaranteed $12,000."
