"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. While $900000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to consider a compromise.  I'm open to selling for $1100000. This takes into account your offer and still reflects the significant value of the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1050000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
