"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
