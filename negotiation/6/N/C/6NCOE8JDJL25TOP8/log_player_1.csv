I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and encourages Bob to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value it brings to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given our respective valuations.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, but $1,375,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,325,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise considering our earlier discussions.  Let's see if we can close this deal.
