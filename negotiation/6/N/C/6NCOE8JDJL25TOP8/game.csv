"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value it brings to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me. Let's meet in the middle.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given our respective valuations.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. While $1,300,000 is tempting, I need to stay closer to my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $1,375,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal.",1375000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, but $1,375,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,325,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise considering our earlier discussions.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
