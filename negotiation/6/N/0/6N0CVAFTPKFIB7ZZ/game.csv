"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings, in my estimation, warrants a figure closer to my initial proposal. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered. What do you think?",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $2,100,000. I still think the price is a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to pay $2,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",2050000.0,Bob,4,
