"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $180 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 180}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I believe I can offer you $150 for the product, which aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While I would love to get more, Bob's offer of $150 is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  It's better than selling to John for the same price, and it avoids further rounds of negotiation."
