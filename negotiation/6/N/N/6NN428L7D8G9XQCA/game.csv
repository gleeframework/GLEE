"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm open to discussing the terms, but I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's worth, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $900,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to stay within your budget while I receive a fair return on my investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, but I can't go lower than $1,000,000 at this point.  This would still be a good deal for you, as the product is worth significantly more to you than that.  Let's see if we can agree on this final price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but no higher. I really need to stay within my budget, and I'm not convinced the product is worth more than that to me.",975000.0,Bob,6,
