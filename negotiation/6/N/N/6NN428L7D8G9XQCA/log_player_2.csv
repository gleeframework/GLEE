Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $900,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to stay within your budget while I receive a fair return on my investment.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, but I can't go lower than $1,000,000 at this point.
