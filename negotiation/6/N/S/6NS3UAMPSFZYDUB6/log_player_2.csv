{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

The price is too high.  It's worth going through at least one round of counteroffers before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
```

I'm starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than what I'm willing to pay from John.  This will hopefully give Alice some room to negotiate while still ensuring I'm getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice I'm serious about buying but still trying to stay below my personal limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is getting closer to my limit, I'm still going to reject the offer and see if I can get Alice down to $80 or just slightly above that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to pay Alice's minimum price, but I won't go higher. If she rejects this, I'll buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is clearly unwilling to go lower than $95.  It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate, as I'm likely to end up paying more than $80 if I keep going.  I'll buy from John and save myself the hassle."
