Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant return on investment it offers.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to engage in this discussion.  While $800,000 is too low for me to consider, I understand your perspective on value. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the inherent value of the product and its potential for significant returns.  I believe it's a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can find common ground.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the adjustment. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $2,000,000 is still a significant leap from my initial offer.  To be completely transparent, my budget caps out closer to $1,000,000. If you're able to work within that range, I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Otherwise, I may need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your candor about your budget.  I've been considering your perspective, and while the product's value firmly stands at the price point I initially presented, I am willing to consider a price of $1,750,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the true worth of what's being offered.  Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she's unwilling to budge significantly from her asking price. Her ""final offer"" is still $750,000 more than your alternative option with John.  While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will come down enough to make it worthwhile.  Buying from John guarantees the best price and avoids further negotiation risk."
