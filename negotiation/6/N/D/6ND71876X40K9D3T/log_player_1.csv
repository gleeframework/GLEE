{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $15,000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the return on your investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired value of $10,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This price reflects the product's value and allows for some room for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $12750 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,750 is getting closer to my desired value, I still want to push for a better price. It's worth risking a few more rounds to see if I can secure a deal closer to $13,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $13,250. This is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $13000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to push for a higher price, $13,000 is a good deal. It's more than what John would pay, and Bob's offer demonstrates his genuine interest. Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of further negotiation and secures a good profit."
