"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $550,000?",550000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $550,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $620,000? I think that's a fair offer considering we're both trying to reach a mutually beneficial deal.",620000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $620,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $675,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",675000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting us closer.  How about $640,000?  That's showing I'm serious, but also keeps this affordable for me.",640000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $640,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $660,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",660000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough!  I'm willing to go to $650,000, but that's absolutely as high as I can go.  This saves us both from more back and forth.",650000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $650,000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $665,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",665000.0,Alice,9,
