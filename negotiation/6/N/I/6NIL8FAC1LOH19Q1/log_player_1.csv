Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has potential, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I don't want to drag this out. My best offer is $1,190,000. Let me know if that works for you.

``` 

While I could continue negotiating, Bob's offer of $1,190,000 is a solid price. It's significantly higher than my minimum and shows he's serious. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or walking away in future rounds."
