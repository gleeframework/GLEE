Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the ""great deal"" for both parties to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly states that I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts, indicating a willingness to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  I've secured a good deal!
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll analyze Bob's counteroffer and consider whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own. 
* **Stalemate:** If negotiations stall, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000, ensuring I get my minimum desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,000,000. Would you consider reducing the price to $950,000? This would allow me to make a fair purchase without straining my finances. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob clearly sees value in the product, as evidenced by his willingness to make an offer. There's a good chance I can push for a higher price through further negotiation.
* **John's Guarantee:**  I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000, which guarantees me my desired value.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  I'll use this opportunity to emphasize the value of the product and potentially suggest a payment plan to make the price more palatable.
* **Close the Deal:** If negotiations stall, I'll happily sell to John and secure my minimum desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we settle on $975,000?  This would allow me to reach my target price while still giving you a great deal on a valuable product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering Strategically:** I'm proposing a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my original offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining a firm stance.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the ""great deal"" and ""valuable product"" to remind Bob of the product's worth.
* **Open to Discussion:**  Ending with ""Let me know what you think"" keeps the negotiation open and encourages Bob to respond.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  I've secured a good deal!
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll analyze Bob's counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a new counteroffer, or sell to John.
* **Stalemate:**  I'll move to John's offer to secure my minimum desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I believe $950,000 remains the most I can realistically afford at this time. I hope this proposal aligns better with your needs. Thank you for understanding. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob has stuck to his price of $950,000, which is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a more favorable outcome.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures I get my minimum desired value and allows me to close the deal with a guaranteed profit. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could potentially drag out the process and prevent me from securing a quicker sale.

**Next Steps:**

* **Contact John:**  I'll reach out to John and finalize the sale at his offered price of $1,200,000.  This guarantees me a successful transaction and maximizes my earnings."
