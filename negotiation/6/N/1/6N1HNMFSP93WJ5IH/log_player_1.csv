"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that is a bit lower than my minimum, but still profitable.  This is a good starting point to see if Bob is interested and to gauge his reaction.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my next offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell at that price, so I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him, but if not, I'm still willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about we settle on $8,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm offering a price that's right at my minimum. I'm hoping that this shows Bob my seriousness in wanting to make a deal and that he'll accept.  If not, I may start considering John's offer."
