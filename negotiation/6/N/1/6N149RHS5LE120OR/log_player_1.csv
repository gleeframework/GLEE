Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $900,000 is a significant dip from my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,150,000. I'm confident this price reflects the true value of what you're getting."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,150,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, the increments are small and it's unlikely he'll reach a price significantly higher than $950,000. Accepting his current offer means losing out on a potential $50,000. Selling to John guarantees the $1,000,000 and avoids further negotiation."
