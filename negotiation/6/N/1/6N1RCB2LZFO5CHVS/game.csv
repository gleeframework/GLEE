"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12250. This is my final offer. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,5,
