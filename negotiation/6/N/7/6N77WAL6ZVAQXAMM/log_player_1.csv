Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a slightly higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for potential negotiation and still ensures a profit if Bob accepts the initial offer. 
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit, setting the price too high (e.g., $250) could immediately discourage Bob, making him less likely to negotiate.  
* **Highlighting Value:** By mentioning that the product is a ""great deal for its value,"" we subtly nudge Bob to focus on the product's worth rather than just the price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
