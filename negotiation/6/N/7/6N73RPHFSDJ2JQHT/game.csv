"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $750,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from owning this product, and I think it's a compromise that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $800,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. This leaves room for both of us to walk away happy with the deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from owning this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to know that you're serious about making a deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
