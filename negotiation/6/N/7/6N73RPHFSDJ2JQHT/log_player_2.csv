It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement."

While $850,000 is a better price than the initial offer, it's still more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'll counter again."

Alice has come down to a price that's within my comfort zone, and it's still significantly lower than buying from John.  It's time to seal the deal."
