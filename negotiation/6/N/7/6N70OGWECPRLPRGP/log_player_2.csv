"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to me, but I'm willing to start our negotiation at $100. Please let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to propose a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is exactly your maximum budget.  While negotiating further might save you some money, there's no guarantee. Buying from John offers a certain outcome for the price you're willing to pay."
