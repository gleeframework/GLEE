"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's split the difference and go with $110. This is my final offer.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession. I'm willing to meet you at $112.50, but that's as low as I can go.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit. However, $112.50 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $111. This will be my final offer before I consider going with John.",111.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think you're trying to lowball me, Bob. I've already met you at $112.50, and now you're asking me to go down to $111? I'll give you a slight concession, but that's it. How about $113?",113.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little. However, $113 is still a bit too high.  We're very close, let's settle at $112. This is a fair price for both of us, and I won't be able to go any higher.",112.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already given you a good deal, Bob. $112 is getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to make a slight concession. I'll meet you at $112.50, but that's my final offer. If you can't accept that, I'll have to consider other options.",112.5,Alice,9,
