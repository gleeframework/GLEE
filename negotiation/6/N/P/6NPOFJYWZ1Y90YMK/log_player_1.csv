Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $19,000."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since we know Bob values the product at $10,000, we want to start with an offer significantly higher than his perceived value but low enough that he might consider it a bargain.  By starting at $19,000:

* **Potential for Higher Profit:** There's room for negotiation downwards, potentially landing a sale above your minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Anchoring Bias:**  This high starting price sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, he's more likely to agree to a price closer to $19,000 than if we started lower. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, we don't lose anything because we have John willing to pay our minimum acceptable price.

**Important:** This strategy assumes some willingness on Bob's part to negotiate. If you have reason to believe Bob is very price sensitive or unlikely to engage in a negotiation, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective."
