"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Buying from Alice:** You get the product for $100, saving $20 compared to buying from John.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer:**  You'll have to buy from John for $120, which is less desirable."
