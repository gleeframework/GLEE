Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the value to Bob to make the offer more appealing.
* **Open-ended Question:**  I invite Bob to respond and start a conversation. 

This strategy balances my need to get a good price with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright. I'm prepared to negotiate further based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm on a budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob is showing interest and acknowledging the product's value, his offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better price:**  I believe there is room for negotiation, and I can likely secure a higher price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is the fallback:**  While selling to John is a guaranteed $15,000, I'm still willing to explore further negotiation with Bob to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low. Given the value of the product, $11,000 is the lowest I can go. It's still a significant savings for you compared to what others would pay. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on benefits for Bob:** I emphasize that my offer is still a significant saving for him, making it more attractive. 
* **Positive tone:**  I maintain a positive tone to avoid seeming inflexible or antagonistic. 
* **Open to further negotiation:** I use language like ""work together to find a solution"" to signal that I'm still open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely, or that further negotiation will lead to a lower price. 
* **Time constraint:**  While selling to John guarantees $15,000, I don't know how long it will take to close that deal. This offer from Bob is a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale.

Ultimately, accepting Bob's offer maximizes my chances of selling the product quickly and at a price that's reasonably close to my minimum."
