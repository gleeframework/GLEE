"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's still a great deal, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, I'm still not comfortable accepting it yet. There are still rounds left, and I want to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still quite a bit below my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to move forward with the deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. Can we meet in the middle at $930,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $930,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired price point.  I'm hoping to get closer to $1,000,000 with a few more rounds of negotiation. It's important to note that selling to John is always an option, but I'm still trying to see if I can maximize my profit with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $930,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I'm firm on a price of $940,000.  This price is a fair reflection of the value of the product for you, and it's a reasonable compromise for me.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 940000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $940,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $915,000. Can we meet in the middle at $927,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $927,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $927,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached round 6, and Bob's offer of $927,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While there are still a few rounds left, I'm concerned that the negotiation is going to stall.  I'm confident that I can get a better price with John, so I'm going to sell to him."
