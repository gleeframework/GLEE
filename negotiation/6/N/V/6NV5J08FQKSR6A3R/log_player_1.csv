Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. This is my maximum price point.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now made the same offer twice, indicating he's unlikely to budge significantly from his $1,100,000 limit.  Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, it's more strategically sound to cut your losses with Bob and accept John's offer. This ensures you receive the product's minimum value to you."
