"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. This is my maximum price point.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understanding your perspective. That said, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a fair offer considering the value this product brings.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. To make this work, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer and reflects a genuine interest in purchasing this product.  Let's find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  I see you're serious about this purchase and I respect your efforts to find a compromise.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'll come down to $1,600,000, and I believe that's a fair deal that reflects the true value of this product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
