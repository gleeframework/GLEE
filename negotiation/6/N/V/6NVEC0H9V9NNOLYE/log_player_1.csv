{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by providing a price slightly higher than the product's known value to Bob, leaving room for potential counteroffers. It also conveys a sense of confidence and fair play, which could lead to a more constructive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I really like the product, but I have to consider my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a good price, it's still below the product's worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, aiming for a price closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $750,000 is a good offer, it's a bit lower than I'd hoped for. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is the minimum I can accept. Let's close this deal and make it happen. "", ""product_price"": 800000}
