"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm starting with an offer of $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to leave room for negotiation.  This will also give me a sense of Bob's potential interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey at $150. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, but it does show interest. I'm not willing to sell for $100, but I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130.  Let's try to make this work. "", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm meeting Bob halfway by reducing my price to $130. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to sell for that price.  I believe there's room for further negotiation.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'm also getting closer to my ""sell to John"" threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $115 is still too low. I'm willing to go down to $125. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

I'm sticking to my minimum price point, but I'm being clear that I'm willing to finalize the deal at this price. This is a good middle ground and I'm hoping Bob will agree. If he doesn't, I'm very close to selling to John for my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $125 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price. It's tempting to accept, but I have a guaranteed offer from John for the same price.  Since I only have 4 rounds left, I'm going to go ahead and sell to John to avoid the risk of further negotiation."
