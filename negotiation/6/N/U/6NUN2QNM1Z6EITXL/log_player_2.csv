Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  It's important that we both feel like we're getting a good deal.  Let's try $850,000. That's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and still gives you a good price.  What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate that.  However, $775,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be closer to $800,000.  Let's split the difference and go with $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it avoids any further back and forth. What do you say?
