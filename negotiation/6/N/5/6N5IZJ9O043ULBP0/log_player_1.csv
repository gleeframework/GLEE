Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to part with it for $119. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, while still exceeding my minimum selling price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing the chance of a sale. 
* **Guaranteed Backup:** If Bob refuses, I'm secure knowing John will buy it for my minimum price."
