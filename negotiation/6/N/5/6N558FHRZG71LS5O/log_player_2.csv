"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's start the negotiation with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than what John is offering, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is unfortunately not a price I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to try and reach an agreement.  This still leaves you a considerable profit margin while allowing me to achieve a more reasonable price for my product. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still a significant amount. Bob has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice offers the potential to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still above what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me and your desired profit margin. Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $875,000 is still not quite enough.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $887,500.  This offer reflects the value of the product to both of us and allows us to close this deal fairly.  Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is close to Bob's last counteroffer of $875,000.  Accepting this offer would save Bob $112,500 compared to buying from John, which is a significant amount. At this point, further negotiation might be time-consuming and could potentially lead to a higher price. It's strategically better to accept the offer and secure a good deal."
