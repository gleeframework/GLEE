Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still above what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me and your desired profit margin. Let's close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

While $875,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
