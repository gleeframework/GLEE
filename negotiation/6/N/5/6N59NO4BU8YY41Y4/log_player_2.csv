Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer, Bob. However, $1000000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1000000 and $1300000, which would be $1150000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. While $1,150,000 is closer to my target, I still need to be under $1,000,000 to make this work.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This represents a substantial compromise for me, and I truly believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1100000. I'm willing to make one last compromise, and I'll meet you halfway between $950000 and $1100000, which would be $1025000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $1,025,000 is still above my desired price range.  While I've been able to negotiate down significantly, it's getting close to the end of our negotiations, and I'm not confident I can get her down to my ideal price.  To avoid risking further time and potentially losing the product entirely, I'm going to choose to purchase from John at $800,000. This ensures I get the product within my budget and saves me from potentially getting stuck in a drawn-out negotiation."
