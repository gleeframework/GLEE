"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. It's a steal considering its value! What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $13,000 at this time. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $13,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $16,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $16,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,500. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $14,500 still isn't quite there for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?  This would give us both a good deal and allow us to finalize this. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $15,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with this deal. Let's finalize this!",15250.0,Bob,6,
