"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. It's a steal considering its value! What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's too early to accept the offer. Bob should aim for a lower price and try to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $13,000 at this time. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $13,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $16,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should keep pushing for a lower price. While $16,000 is closer, it's still above his target. He should counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $16,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,500. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $14,500 still isn't quite there for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?  This would give us both a good deal and allow us to finalize this. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should still reject the offer. While $15,500 is getting closer to his target, he can still try to get a better deal.  He should counteroffer with a price closer to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $15,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with this deal. Let's finalize this!"", ""product_price"": 15250}
