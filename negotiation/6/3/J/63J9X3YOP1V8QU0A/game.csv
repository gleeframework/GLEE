"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $600,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, though! I'd be happy to consider a price of $900,000. It's a fair middle ground that still reflects the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That said, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'd be happy to consider a price of $850,000. It's the highest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
