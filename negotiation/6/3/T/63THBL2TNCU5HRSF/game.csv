"Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, that price is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider a lower price of $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $90? It's a fair price that still benefits both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we settle at $75?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $105? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
