"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. Can you consider it?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is unfortunately below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,800. Can you consider it?",7800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm firm on the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,000. This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do. Let's close this deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
