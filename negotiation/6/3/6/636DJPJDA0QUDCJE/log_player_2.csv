"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it could be highly beneficial for your business. I'm asking for $1,400,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its potential.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still above my target. There are 10 rounds, so I have time to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which reflects the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which I think is a fair compromise. It's still a significant gain for you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is closer to my target of $1,200,000. However, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to try to get her down further before considering buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This price would be a win-win for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
