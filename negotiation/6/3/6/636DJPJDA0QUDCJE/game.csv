"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it could be highly beneficial for your business. I'm asking for $1,400,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its potential.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which reflects the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which I think is a fair compromise. It's still a significant gain for you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can make this work.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This price would be a win-win for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
