"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider something closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply not a realistic price for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my minimum. How about $8,500?  That would give us both a good deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? I believe that's a reasonable compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to compromise a little further, but I need to see a price closer to $9,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,750. What do you say?",8750.0,Alice,5,
