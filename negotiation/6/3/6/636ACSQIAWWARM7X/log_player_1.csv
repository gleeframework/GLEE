Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives him some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** It leaves room for you to negotiate higher if necessary.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  A much higher price could make Bob immediately walk away. 

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to counteroffer to try to get a price closer to my desired $1,400,000.  There's a good chance Bob will be willing to pay a bit more after seeing how much I value the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This price reflects the value of the product and is still within a range that allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $1,325,000 for your product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,325,000 is still below my ideal price, it's only $25,000 away from my last counteroffer.  Given that I can sell to John for $1,500,000, it's not worth risking a longer negotiation.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and avoids any potential for further price drops in future rounds."
