"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with at this moment.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get a good deal.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $10,500, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we try $10,375? It's a compromise that works for me, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",10375.0,Alice,5,
