"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high initially to test Bob's willingness to pay and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Mentioning the ""value and potential"" subtly emphasizes why the product is worth a premium.
* **Polite and Professional:** The tone is positive and respectful, aiming to build a good rapport for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,450,000 is unfortunately out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  This is a significant discount from your asking price, but still a fair value for the product in my opinion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to make a deal, accepting a loss isn't an option. I'll counter-offer in the next round, aiming to close the gap without scaring Bob away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,300,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counter-offer shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's high value to justify the price. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The offer is straightforward, making it easy for Bob to understand and respond to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in the product, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum.  If you're willing to accept this, we can finalize the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met my absolute minimum acceptable price. While I initially aimed for a higher price, accepting this offer guarantees I achieve my baseline and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether by continuing to negotiate."
