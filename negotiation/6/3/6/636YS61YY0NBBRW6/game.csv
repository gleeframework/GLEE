"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $80 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  It's still a great price for a product worth much more. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm willing to go up to $90, but $125 is still a bit more than I had in mind.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $110. It's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can do $95, but that's really pushing my budget.  Do you think we can make this work?",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. $95 is a good offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $105? That's a reasonable price considering the product's value.  Let's close this deal.",105.0,Alice,7,
