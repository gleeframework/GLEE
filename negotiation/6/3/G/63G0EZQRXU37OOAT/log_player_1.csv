Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product.  Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects its worth and the significant benefits you'll reap."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you are in a strong position to aim high with Bob.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high offer of $1,800,000, you set a strong anchor point. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're more likely to land a final price well above your minimum. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value without revealing your bottom line.  This provides a basis for the high price.
* **Risk Tolerance:**  There's a chance Bob could reject the offer. However, the potential reward of securing a much higher price than $1,000,000 makes this risk worthwhile.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's personality and negotiating style, other approaches might be suitable."
