"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm starting the conversation at $1,100,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting significantly above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum, I establish a strong negotiating position and leave room for concessions. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential""  aims to frame the price in a positive light, even if it's initially higher than Bob might expect. 
* **Open for Negotiation:** The tone remains collaborative, indicating a willingness to discuss and potentially adjust the price to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money on this investment. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant increase, it's still substantially below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal, especially since Bob seems genuinely interested.  I'll counter with a price closer to my target, leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value. To be candid, $950,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,025,000?  This demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution while acknowledging the product's inherent value."", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:**  I acknowledge Bob's offer and express understanding to maintain a positive negotiating atmosphere.
* **Strategic Compromise:** By suggesting a price exactly halfway between our previous positions, I signal flexibility but also stand firm on achieving a price closer to my target. 
* **Value Emphasis:** Re-emphasizing the ""inherent value"" reinforces the justification for a higher price point. 
* **Urgency (Implied):** While not explicitly stated, time is a factor (limited rounds). By making a significant concession, I hope to encourage Bob to reciprocate and move closer to a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value of the product, and I'm open to further negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly negotiating and moving closer to my range, but $975,000 is still below my acceptable minimum. I need to hold firm to signal the value of the product while continuing to incentivize Bob to stay engaged.  I'll make a smaller concession this time to apply some pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find common ground.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,010,000. This is a significant concession on my end, reflecting my desire to finalize this deal. I believe this offer represents a fair and mutually beneficial outcome."", 
""product_price"": 1010000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Appreciation:** Acknowledge Bob's effort to keep the negotiation alive, building rapport.
* **Small Concession:**  The smaller reduction in price ($15,000) signals firmness while still demonstrating a willingness to move towards a deal.
* **Finality:**  Phrases like ""significant concession"" and ""fair and mutually beneficial outcome"" aim to nudge Bob towards closing the deal without further haggling.
* **Time Pressure (Implicit):** We're past the halfway point of the rounds, implying a sense of urgency without resorting to explicit deadlines."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, Alice. However, $1,010,000 is still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to pay $965,000 for the product. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is barely budging, and it's clear he's aiming for a price well below my minimum. Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of reaching a stalemate or getting too close to the end of the rounds without a deal.  I have a guaranteed offer from John at my desired price, so it's more strategic to walk away from Bob and secure the $1,200,000."
