Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price we both agree on, but $75 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's a good deal for you.  Let's finalize this and avoid further delays.

Alice is very slowly coming down in price, and it's unlikely we'll reach a deal significantly better than John's offer.  It's time to cut our losses and buy from John for $80."
