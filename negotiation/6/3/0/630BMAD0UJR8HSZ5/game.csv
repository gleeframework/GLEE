"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is simply not enough for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go below $120.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $120 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Could we settle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price we both agree on, but $75 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's a good deal for you.  Let's finalize this and avoid further delays.",100.0,Alice,5,
