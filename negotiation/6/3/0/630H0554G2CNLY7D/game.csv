"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm offering it to you for $14,500, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!",14500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $12,500 is closer, but still a bit above what I'm comfortable spending. Could we do $11,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm happy to continue working with you. However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still being within your budget. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,5,
