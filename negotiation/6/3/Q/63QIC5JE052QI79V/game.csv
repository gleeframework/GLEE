"Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a steal at $200. It's a fantastic deal, what do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I can only go up to $80 right now. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but $200 is already a steal for this product! How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That's the absolute highest I can go.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still quite a bit below my bottom line.  How about we try $125? I'm really trying to be fair here.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my absolute final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to come down to $115, but that's my absolute lowest.  Take it or leave it.",115.0,Alice,7,
