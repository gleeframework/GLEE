{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. I'm also trying to be friendly and encouraging in my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm hoping to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $120 is a bit lower than I can go right now.  How about $140?  It's still a good deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $140. This is still higher than what Bob offered, but it's closer to his offer and shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to try and encourage Bob to come closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $140, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $130? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. I think I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $130 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135. Let's close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counteroffering at $135, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm trying to be firm but also show flexibility, and I'm emphasizing a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $135. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $125, but that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $150.  Bob's offer of $125 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I don't think I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with him. It's better to sell to John and guarantee myself a profit."
