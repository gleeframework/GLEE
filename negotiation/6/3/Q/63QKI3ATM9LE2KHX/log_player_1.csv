"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, could we discuss a price closer to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob seems firmly set on $9,000.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Taking the guaranteed $10,000 from John is the most profitable decision."
