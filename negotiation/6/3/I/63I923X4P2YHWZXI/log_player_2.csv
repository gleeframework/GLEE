"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a chance for you to gain a significant advantage. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product. Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is better than buying from John, but you can potentially do even better.  By rejecting the offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or explore other options."
