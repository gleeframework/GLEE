"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows that you're willing to be flexible, which might encourage Bob to counteroffer.  Remember, you have 10 rounds, so if he rejects, you can adjust your strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $115 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120. You have 8 rounds remaining, so you have room to negotiate further and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise by coming down from your initial offer but still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Value Argument:** Highlighting the value of the product can help convince Bob to pay more.
* **Urgency:**  By mentioning an agreement, you subtly suggest a sense of urgency and potentially encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's my final offer. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $108 is closer to your minimum acceptable price of $120, it's still not enough. You have 6 rounds remaining, and there's a chance Bob might be willing to go higher, especially since he's already indicated he's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $108 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $112.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 112}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  You're demonstrating flexibility by meeting Bob halfway, but still above your minimum price.
* **Mutual Benefit:** Framing it as a fair price that benefits both parties can make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Direct Question:**  Ending with a direct question encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
