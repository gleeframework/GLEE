"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $115 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's my final offer. Let's see if we can make this work.",108.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $108 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $112.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  What do you think?",112.0,Alice,5,
