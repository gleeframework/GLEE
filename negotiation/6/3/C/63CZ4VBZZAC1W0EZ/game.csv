"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a great deal for you. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $950,000 is still too far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $1,000,000 to make this deal work. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the negotiation, but I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll meet you at $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If I don't get a better price, I'll have to explore other options.",980000.0,Bob,6,
