Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,900,000? I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While we could continue negotiating, accepting $1,900,000 is a strong outcome. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  Even though the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, securing a $400,000 profit is a great deal.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations and potentially getting a lower offer later.
* **John as Backup:**  Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for your minimum acceptable price. Accepting Bob's offer removes the uncertainty of further negotiation."
