"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That's a significant discount, and it shows I'm serious about making this deal work. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for getting back to me. I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $10,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming a bit lower.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal within a reasonable range.  Let's make this happen.",10000.0,Alice,5,
