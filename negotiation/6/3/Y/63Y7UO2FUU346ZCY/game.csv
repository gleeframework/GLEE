"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is reflective of the significant return on investment you'll see.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but it's not worth nearly that much.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your perspective on the price.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Would you consider $1,900,000? This takes into account the product's true value and potential for significant returns.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, but that's my limit.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I want to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,600,000?  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my willingness to make a deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a big gap. I can go up to $800,000, but that's absolutely my final offer.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to go with another option.",800000.0,Bob,6,
