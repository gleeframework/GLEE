Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation. I'm confident in the product's value and I'm willing to negotiate, but I want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14,250}

I'm counteroffering at $14,250. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and Bob's potential interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's only $250 less than my previous counteroffer and significantly higher than John's offer. It's important to balance maximizing profit with the risk of losing the deal entirely."
