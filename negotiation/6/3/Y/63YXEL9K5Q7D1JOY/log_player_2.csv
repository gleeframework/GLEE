"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer,  dropping the price by $200,000. This signals my seriousness about acquiring the product but establishes a clear bargaining point.  It's likely Alice will counter with a price closer to her desired value, allowing for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point.  I believe I can continue negotiating and get a better deal.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can secure a price closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going all in with my maximum budget. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and that I'm willing to pay a fair price. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll be forced to buy from John, but it's worth pushing for a deal with Alice since it's possible she might be willing to accept my final offer."
