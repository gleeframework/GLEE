{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $950,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $950,000 is more than your minimum of $800,000, ensuring you profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $950,000 is less than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, giving him a reason to consider the offer.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This price allows for potential counteroffers and gives you flexibility to adjust your offer if necessary."
