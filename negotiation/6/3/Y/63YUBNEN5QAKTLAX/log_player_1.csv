Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $100. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good strategy to start with a price slightly higher than you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Leaving Room for Profit:** While we know Bob values the product at $120,  asking for the full amount might make him hesitant. Offering it at $100 gives him a perceived deal while still netting you a $20 profit over your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  It's important to remember we have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $80. This gives us leverage in the negotiation, as we're not desperate to sell at any cost."
