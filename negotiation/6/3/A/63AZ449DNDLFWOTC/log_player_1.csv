Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $135 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  It's above his perceived value ($120) but might be enticing with the right messaging.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below $150, but aiming slightly higher could yield a better profit.
* **""Special Price"" Psychology:** By framing it as a ""special price,"" it suggests to Bob he's getting a better deal than usual, potentially increasing his willingness to accept."
