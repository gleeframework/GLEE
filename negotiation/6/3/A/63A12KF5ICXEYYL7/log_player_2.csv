Round 7
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,060,000 is getting very close to my ideal price. While I'd prefer to get it for even lower, I've already rejected several offers and don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. It's better to accept this offer than to risk getting stuck buying from John for a much higher price.  We're running out of rounds, so it's time to settle."
