{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a starting point, as I need to make sure I secure at least the minimum value for the product ($150). I'll be flexible and willing to negotiate, but I'll always keep John's offer in mind as my backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired value of $150. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, and I have John as a backup buyer.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? It's still a fair price, considering the value you'll get from it."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob. $140 is closer to my minimum, and it might be a good compromise. I'll keep John's offer in mind, but I'm still hoping to make a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $130. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum value of $150.  The negotiation has taken a few rounds, and it seems unlikely I can get Bob to go higher.  I'm comfortable accepting his offer and finalizing the sale."
