"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $105 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $135?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $115. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $125. It's a fair price that I can live with, and I think you'll find it's a good value for the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
