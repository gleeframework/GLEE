"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?  I'm really interested in this product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is a good compromise for me, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,250. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",13250.0,Alice,5,
