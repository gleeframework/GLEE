"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  To be fair, I'm starting with an initial offer of $1,450,000.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, your starting price is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for me.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but the gap between our valuations is still quite significant.  This product represents a unique opportunity, and I believe its true worth is closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to explore other options.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I respect your position, but I also need to ensure a fair deal for myself. Your last offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,375,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
