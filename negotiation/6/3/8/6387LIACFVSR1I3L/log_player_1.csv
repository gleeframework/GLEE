Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture most of the potential profit.  This leaves room for negotiation, while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if Bob will come up in price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}

I'm lowering my price again to $12,500. This is a significant compromise, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal.  I'm running out of rounds and need to find a middle ground."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We are running out of rounds, and Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, selling to John guarantees I make a profit."
