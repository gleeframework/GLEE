"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but still leaves me a profit margin. I'm also trying to build rapport by being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 
I'm lowering the price slightly from my initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting the fact that this offer is still a good deal for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with it. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  There are still 6 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $100? This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering the price slightly again, but I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm also emphasizing that this offer is fair and allows both of us to benefit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  We're at round 6, and I've already made several concessions to Bob.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I'm worried that I'm going to end up settling for a price that's too low.  John is offering me my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing that opportunity."
