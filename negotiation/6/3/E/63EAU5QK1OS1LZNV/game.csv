"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm interested in purchasing it, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To find a middle ground, I would like to propose a price of $7,500 for the product. This still reflects its value to both of us while being more accessible to your budget.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, you've been very reasonable throughout this negotiation, and I appreciate that.  However, I need to stick to my budget.  If you're willing to come down to $7,100, I'm ready to close the deal right now.  Otherwise, I think I'll need to explore other options.",7100.0,Bob,6,
