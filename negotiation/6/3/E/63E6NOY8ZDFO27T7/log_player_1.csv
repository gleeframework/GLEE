I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I'll see how Bob reacts to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn. Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale and a decent profit."
