{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's too early to tell if Alice's offer is a good deal or not.  Rejecting the offer allows us to see if she'll lower the price and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer.  This will give us a good sense of Alice's bottom line and if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is showing some flexibility by lowering her price, but I believe I can still get a better deal.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get the price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly. We're getting closer to a possible agreement, but it's still worth pushing for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're getting close to a price I might be willing to accept, but I'm still going to reject the offer and see if we can get even closer.  It's worth pushing for a slightly lower price before making a final decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}

I'm increasing my offer again, but not by much.  We're very close to a potential deal, and I want to see if Alice will meet me in the middle."
