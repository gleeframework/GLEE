Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $140. It's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 allows room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring a significant profit above my minimum ($100).
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John provides a safety net, allowing me to aim higher with Bob."
