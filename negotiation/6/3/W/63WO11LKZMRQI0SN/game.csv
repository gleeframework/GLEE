"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your price and the product's worth to you. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $13,500? This would be a fair compromise, as it's still well above my minimum price and closer to the value you place on the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your new offer and my initial counteroffer. How about $13,000? This is the highest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
