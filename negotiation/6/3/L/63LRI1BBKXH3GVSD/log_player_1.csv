"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $15,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm friendly and positive, highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to consider it. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to get as much as I can from Bob, but I'm also aware of the $12,000 alternative.  I'll assess Bob's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer meets my minimum, I'm not satisfied with settling for the bare minimum.  There are still rounds left, and I believe there's potential to get closer to my initial asking price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above his. I'll use the remaining rounds to negotiate and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand it's a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, as a compromise.  I believe this price is still fair considering the product's value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm reducing the price to $13,500, which is a significant step down from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's position but emphasizing the product's value to justify my price. 
* **Strategy:**  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob while still leaving some room for further negotiation. I'll keep in mind John's offer of $12,000 as my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12000.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is firmly at $12,000 and has already rejected my counteroffer.  While I could continue negotiating, we're likely at an impasse.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'll take the safe option and sell to him. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is limited:**  I have limited rounds to close the deal. 
* **No guarantee of improvement:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will budge in future rounds, and I risk losing more time and potentially ending up with the same $12,000.
* **Security of the deal:**  John's offer provides a secure and guaranteed sale at my minimum price, eliminating any risk."
