"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You can get the product for $12,000 from John, so you should reject Alice's offer of $9,500.  You have room to negotiate a lower price with Alice and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is based on the following logic:

* **Alice's minimum:** Alice is willing to sell for at least $8,000.
* **Your maximum:** You are willing to pay a maximum of $12,000.
* **Negotiation:** By offering $8,500, you are splitting the difference between your maximum and Alice's minimum.  This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.

This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it, but it also signals that you are serious about purchasing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your ideal price. You can try to negotiate further by making another counteroffer. Since you are willing to pay $12,000 for the product, you can still try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now $9,700.  You are willing to pay a maximum of $12,000 and are aiming to split the difference between your maximum and her minimum. 

This counteroffer of $9,000 is a reasonable compromise and could potentially lead to a successful deal. If Alice rejects it, you may need to reconsider your options, but you are still in a good negotiating position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering $9,800, which is very close to your maximum price of $12,000. At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to yield significant savings. It's more efficient to buy the product from John at $12,000 to avoid spending more time negotiating and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
