{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its true value to me. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:**  $1,000,000 is significantly closer to my desired $1,200,000 than Bob's perceived value of $800,000.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  The offer is not too aggressive, allowing for potential counteroffers from Bob. 
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:**  If Bob rejects, I still have the option to sell to John for my desired price."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is closer to my desired price than his initial offer, I'm confident that I can still do better with some negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $950,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. I'm offering you the product for $975,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to me and the potential for further negotiations.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I am willing to consider an offer closer to $950,000. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle at $960,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $960,000 is a good compromise, and it's much closer to my desired price than his initial offer. While I could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that he might walk away entirely, leaving me with only the option to sell to John.  $960,000 is a solid outcome."
