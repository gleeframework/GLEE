"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you a price of $11,500. This is a compromise between our initial offers, and I think it's a fair deal. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I like the idea of meeting in the middle, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price of $10,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you a price of $10,800. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be fair, how about we split the difference again and settle at $10,400?",10400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going below my minimum price of $10,800. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you a price of $10,600. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement. What do you think?",10600.0,Alice,7,
