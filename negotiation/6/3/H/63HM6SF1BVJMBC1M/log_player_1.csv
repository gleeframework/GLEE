"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a bit more. I'll keep in mind the possibility of selling to John for $12,000 if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can get a bit more.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}

I'm going to counter with $14,500.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully will be more appealing to him."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is still above my minimum, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds. If this doesn't work, I might have to consider selling to John in the next round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I still think I can get a bit more. I have 4 rounds left and I'm not ready to settle for the minimum yet. I'll try one more counteroffer and if it fails, I might have to consider selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but still above my minimum. I'm running out of rounds, so I need to be more flexible, but I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We're down to two rounds left, and while I'd like to get closer to my initial target, $12,500 is a good deal and above my minimum. It's a better outcome than selling to John for $12,000."
