Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

This offer starts high, aiming to maximize potential profit. However, it's important to be prepared to negotiate down if Bob counters. I've factored in the $1,200,000 minimum I'm willing to accept, leaving room for negotiation.  The success of this strategy depends on how much Bob values the product and how willing he is to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm going to counteroffer, hoping to bridge the gap.  The next counteroffer needs to be carefully considered to balance maximizing profit with the risk of losing the sale entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000} 
```

This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable sale. This strategy aims to signal to Bob that I'm serious about selling, but also that I'm not willing to give up much more profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and within a reasonable range.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale entirely, especially since I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000.  The risk of driving Bob away outweighs the potential for a higher price at this point."
