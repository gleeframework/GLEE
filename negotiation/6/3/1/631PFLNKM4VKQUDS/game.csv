"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a compromise. How about $10,000? This reflects my willingness to make a deal while still acknowledging the product's worth.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $7,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $7,000 is close, but I need to get at least $8,000 for it to make sense for me.  That's my final offer.",8000.0,Alice,5,
