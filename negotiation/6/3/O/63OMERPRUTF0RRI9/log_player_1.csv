Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why 1 million?**  This offer represents a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts. 
    * **For you:** It's significantly more than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
    * **For Bob:** It's a good deal for him, as he values the product at $1,200,000, giving him a potential profit of $200,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Offering too high a price risks Bob rejecting, forcing you to sell to John at a lower price. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Starting with a higher price allows room for potential negotiation if Bob counters with a lower offer.

This offer sets a strong starting point for negotiation while still giving Bob a compelling reason to accept."
