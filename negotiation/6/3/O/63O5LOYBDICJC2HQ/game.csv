"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and it's certainly valuable to me as well. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's worth. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $750,000 is a more reasonable price for me. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $750,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $825,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $825,000. I'm willing to go up to $810,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can agree on this price.",810000.0,Bob,4,
