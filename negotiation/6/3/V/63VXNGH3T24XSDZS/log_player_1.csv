"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $1,750,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives me some room to negotiate.  If Bob rejects, it's likely he'll counter with a lower price, and we can then work towards a mutually agreeable solution. 

Remember, I have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 at any time, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting point, but it's still above his perceived value.  I'm not willing to settle for that price yet. There's still room for negotiation.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it's a more reasonable counteroffer to Bob's $1,200,000 proposal. I believe this price is fair and will hopefully lead to a deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to settle for $1,100,000. I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $1,500,000. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating.  It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John at any time for $1,500,000, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price again, but still maintaining a significant profit margin. This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. 

The goal here is to try and close the gap between our positions. If Bob rejects this offer, we'll be approaching the halfway point in negotiations, and I'll need to carefully consider my next move, potentially shifting my strategy to focus on getting the deal done rather than maximizing profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting very close to his perceived value of $1,000,000. While it's tempting to accept at this point, I'm still not comfortable with such a low price. There are only a few rounds left, and I need to try and secure a better deal. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer.  However, I'll need to be more flexible in my pricing as we approach the final rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and I need to be more flexible.  This counteroffer is lower than my previous one but still represents a good profit margin. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in closing the deal at this price, especially considering he's already rejected several offers.  If he rejects again, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John, as the risk of not closing the deal is increasing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is very close to his perceived value, and we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds.  While I could make another counteroffer, it's increasingly likely that Bob will either reject it or offer a price that's too low for me to accept.  Given the risk of not reaching a deal and the time constraint, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
