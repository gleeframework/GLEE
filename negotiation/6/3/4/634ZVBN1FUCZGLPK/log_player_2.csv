Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $11,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit while also reflecting the value you place on the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible.  There's still a $500 difference between Alice's offer and Bob's desired price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure an even better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to increase my offer to $10,750. This price is a fair compromise that reflects the value we both place on the product. I believe this offer is a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not sure if $10,750 is enough to justify the value of the product. I'm willing to consider a price of $11,200, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's worth and the value you place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,200 is still better than John's price of $12,000. While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away and having to buy from John at a higher price is too high. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price, saving him $800 compared to buying from John."
