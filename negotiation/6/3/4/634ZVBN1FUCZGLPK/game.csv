"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it and allows for a fair profit for you. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $11,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit while also reflecting the value you place on the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to increase my offer to $10,750. This price is a fair compromise that reflects the value we both place on the product. I believe this offer is a good deal for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not sure if $10,750 is enough to justify the value of the product. I'm willing to consider a price of $11,200, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's worth and the value you place on it.",11200.0,Alice,5,
