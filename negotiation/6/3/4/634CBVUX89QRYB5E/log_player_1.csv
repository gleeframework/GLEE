Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to the maximum value you can get for the product. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  While you know Bob values the product at $80, he might be willing to pay a bit more. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John, so there's no risk of getting stuck with the product.

By offering the product at $119, you're aiming for a price that's:

* **Above Bob's Valuation:**  Giving him a perceived ""deal"".
* **Below Your Guarantee:** Ensuring you still make more than selling to John. 

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
