``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a slightly higher price than the minimum I'm willing to accept, leaving room for potential compromise.  I'm also highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is above my absolute minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
