"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe you'll find it's a great investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal. However, I've had other interested parties in the past who were willing to pay $14,000 for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is a better price than John's offer, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. Rejecting allows Bob to try and further negotiate and get closer to his ideal price of $11,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
