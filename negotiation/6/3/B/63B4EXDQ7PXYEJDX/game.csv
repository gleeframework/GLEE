"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the value in the product, I'm currently unable to meet that price.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it, reflecting the maximum I can currently afford.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value you place on the product, while also ensuring I get a reasonable return on my investment.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
