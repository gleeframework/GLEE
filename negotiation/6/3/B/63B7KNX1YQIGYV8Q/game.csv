"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $14,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford up to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $10,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we agree on $7,000? That's a fair price considering John is willing to sell it for $8,000.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you a price of $9,500, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a discount from my initial price. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the value of the product and the fact that John is willing to pay $12,000 for it.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,500.  This is a fair compromise considering my budget and the current market. What do you say?",7500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is still a discount from my initial price, but closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to feel confident that we're at a fair price. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,7,
