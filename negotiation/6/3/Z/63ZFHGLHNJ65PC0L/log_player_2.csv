"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject and counteroffer, as you have the option to purchase from John for a lower price if negotiations with Alice fail."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, your initial price is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, $900000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your budget. You have a better option with John, who is selling the product for $1,000,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as there's a chance she might lower her price further, but you're not obligated to accept any offer above your target."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. To make a deal, I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I can purchase the same product from John for that price. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finalize the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
