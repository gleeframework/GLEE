,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Let's see if we can make a deal.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $130 is cutting it too close to my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $170? It's a fair price for both of us.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $170 is still a bit high for me. How about $145? That's closer to my limit, and hopefully we can finalize the deal.",145.0,Bob,4,
