"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. While I'm very interested in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
