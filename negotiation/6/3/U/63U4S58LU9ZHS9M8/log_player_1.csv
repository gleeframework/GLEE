Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. While I'm very interested in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
