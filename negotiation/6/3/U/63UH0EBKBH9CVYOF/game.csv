,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $110 is a bit high for me. How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $115. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $110.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from John.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $112.50. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. I'm not willing to go any lower, but I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at $112.50. I'm willing to go up to $111.  This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll need to go with John's offer.",111.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $111. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $113. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",113.0,Alice,7,
