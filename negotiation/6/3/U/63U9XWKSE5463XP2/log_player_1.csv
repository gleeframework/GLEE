Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,100,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I receive a profit significantly higher than my minimum. It's also less than the product's worth to Bob, making it a potentially attractive offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to the product's value. It's also a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, $950,000 is still a significant profit for me, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether. It's also closer to my desired price than John's offer."
