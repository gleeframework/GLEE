Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $875,000. This would allow us both to secure a fair deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Offering a price in the middle of your previous offer and Alice's latest offer shows a willingness to compromise.
