"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging, aiming to build rapport.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm subtly highlighting the value of the product to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm clearly open to negotiation by asking for Bob's feedback.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while still keeping the deal alive. By starting high and showing willingness to negotiate, I hope to secure a price closer to my desired $15,000 while still potentially finding common ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.** While $9,500 is closer to my desired range, it's still significantly lower than my $15,000 floor. 
* **I have 9 rounds left.** This gives me room to negotiate further and potentially secure a better price.
* **Selling to John is an option, but I'd prefer to see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob.** John's offer guarantees me my desired amount, but I might be able to get even more by continuing the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the gap between our desired prices while keeping the deal alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,500 is closer, it's still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the product's value, reminding Bob why this price is justified.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to continue negotiations.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:**  By lowering my price, I'm demonstrating flexibility and increasing the chances of Bob accepting.
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm still significantly above Bob's offer, indicating my willingness to compromise while still prioritizing my own financial goals.
* **Keep the negotiation active:**  By showing a willingness to meet halfway, I encourage Bob to counter again, potentially leading to a deal closer to my desired price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $10,400 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,600.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,200. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are down to the final two rounds, and Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Limited Negotiation Space:**  The difference between our desired prices is small, and further negotiation might not lead to a significantly better outcome for me.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired $15,000, ensuring I meet my minimum financial goal.

**Strategy:**

While I would prefer to close a deal with Bob, I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed profit. Selling to John allows me to secure my desired price and move on, rather than potentially ending up with a lower price after more rounds of negotiation."
