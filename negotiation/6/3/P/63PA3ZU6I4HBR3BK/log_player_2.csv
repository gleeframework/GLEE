Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get as close to $120 as possible. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $130? It's the lowest I'm comfortable going, but I think it's a fair compromise.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming closer to my budget, it's unlikely she'll go below $130. I can get the product for my target price of $120 from John, so it makes sense to take that offer."
