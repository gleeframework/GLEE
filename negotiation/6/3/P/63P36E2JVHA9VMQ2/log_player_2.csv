"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I believe this price is a fair compromise between our respective valuations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer allows him to try and get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product is worth more than $1,050,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,175,000 is still above Bob's target. He has room to negotiate further and try to get a price closer to his initial counteroffer."

I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our last two offers at $1,100,000.  This price is fair, considering our respective valuations, and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob ideally wants to pay closer to his last counteroffer of $1,100,000, Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  

* **Risk of rejection:**  If Bob rejects this offer and counteroffers again, Alice might walk away, leaving Bob with no option but to buy from John at a much higher price.
* **Value to Bob:** Even at $1,125,000, Bob is still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John. 

Therefore, accepting the offer is the most logical decision, securing the product at a price that is still within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's offer."
