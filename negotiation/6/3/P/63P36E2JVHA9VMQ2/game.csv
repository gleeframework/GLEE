"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I believe this price is a fair compromise between our respective valuations.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest.  However,  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product is worth more than $1,050,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there.  $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our last two offers at $1,100,000.  This price is fair, considering our respective valuations, and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
