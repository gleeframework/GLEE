It's always a good idea to try and negotiate, especially when there's a significant difference between your target price and Alice's offer.  Let's see if we can get a better deal!"

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

Let's start by offering Alice a price that's closer to our target but still leaves some room for negotiation.  $850,000 is a significant discount from her initial offer, and it might be enough to pique her interest."

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still not within our desired range. We're not desperate to buy from Alice, and John is a safe backup. Let's see if we can get Alice to come down further."

Alice is getting closer to our target price, but we're still not quite there. Let's see if we can get her to budge just a little bit more before we consider buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 870000}

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}

We'll go back to our previous offer of $875,000. Alice seems to be stuck at $880,000, so maybe a small concession on our part will get the deal done."

We've reached a point where we're very close to our target price.  $878,000 is a good compromise and we're likely not going to get a significantly better deal in this round. It's time to accept the offer and finalize the purchase."
