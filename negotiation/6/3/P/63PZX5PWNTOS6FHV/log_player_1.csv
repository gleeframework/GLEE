```

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,750,000. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum requirement ($1,500,000).  While I could sell to John for that amount, I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows us both to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows a genuine desire to reach an agreement.

* **Closing the Deal:** I'm using language that encourages a final agreement."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,475,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are now in round 6, and while Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  The negotiation is getting lengthy and the risk of a prolonged process is increasing. With only four rounds remaining, I need to be decisive. 

Given that John is willing to buy the product for my minimum price of $1,500,000, it's the most prudent choice at this point.  Selling to John guarantees that I reach my desired outcome and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob."
