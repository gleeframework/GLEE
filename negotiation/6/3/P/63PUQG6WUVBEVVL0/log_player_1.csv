Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $119 for it.  It's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below her minimum ($120). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit for Alice if he accepts.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $120 to John, so there's no pressure to go below that price with Bob. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging the guaranteed sale to John as a safety net."
