"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, potentially saving a large sum of money.  Buying from John is a backup option, but you should exhaust negotiations with Alice before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening move, demonstrating my commitment to buying the product while setting a clear price point. It's likely Alice will counteroffer, but this gives us a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my maximum budget, but it's closer.  I'll continue negotiating, as there's still room for potential savings.  Buying from John would be the next step if Alice's offers remain too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,100,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to go above my maximum budget. I'm hoping this will entice Alice to come down a bit more.  If she rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above my desired price, but it's close enough to my maximum budget.  I've been negotiating with Alice for a while, and it seems like she's unlikely to go lower.  At this point, it's more beneficial to accept her offer and secure the product, rather than risk losing it and having to buy from John at a higher price."
