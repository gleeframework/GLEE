"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, but we're starting our negotiations at a special introductory price of $120. We're confident you'll find it's well worth the investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price. Alice's starting price is significantly higher than her own valuation of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

This counter-offer aims to achieve a few things:

* **Polite and positive:**  Maintaining a good rapport with Alice is important for a smooth negotiation.
* **Expresses interest:** Showing genuine interest in the product can encourage Alice to be more flexible.
* **Significant drop:** The counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Offers a rationale:** Suggesting a middle ground makes the offer seem reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your interest in our product. To try to accommodate your budget, I would like to offer the product at $100. This is still a premium price, but I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings. Please let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, we still have room to negotiate.  Let's see if we can get her down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford. Could you do $95? That would seal the deal for me."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledgment:** We acknowledge Alice's effort in lowering her price.
* **Urgency:**  Phrases like ""getting closer"" and ""seal the deal"" create a sense of urgency and potential agreement.
* **Small increment:**  By only countering with a $5 decrease, we signal that we're getting close to our limit and encourage Alice to accept. 
* **Clear goal:**  We reiterate that this price will close the deal, encouraging Alice to accept."
