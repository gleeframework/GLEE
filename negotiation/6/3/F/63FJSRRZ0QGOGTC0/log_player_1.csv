"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount, considering its value to me is much higher. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the discount, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to offer $600,000.  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and Bob's offer is significantly lower than her minimum acceptable price.  Alice should reject this offer and try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far below what I can accept.  The product has significant value to me, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value to you, and I'm committed to finding a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I'm confident it would be a worthwhile purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what she could get by selling to John. Alice should continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to push the price higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $750,000 is closer, but I'm still not there yet.  Given the product's value to me, I need to be closer to $850,000 to make this deal work.  I believe this price is fair considering the potential value it holds for you.  Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 850000}
