"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $110 for it, given its value to me. Let me know if that works for you.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. Considering the value of the product to both of us, I propose we settle on $125. This allows some room for both of us while ensuring fair compensation for the product. Please let me know if this suggestion suits your needs.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $115, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",115.0,Bob,4,
