"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, but considering its value to you, I suggest we start at $150. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $150 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $120.  It's worth exploring negotiation before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $110 for it, given its value to me. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above my maximum budget of $120.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $115, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is exactly my maximum budget. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better price, and I risk running out of rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
