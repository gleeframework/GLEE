Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$130 is a reasonable starting point.** It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate. 
* **The message is friendly and inviting.** This sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **It's important to remember that I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $150.** This gives me confidence to push for a higher price during the negotiation. 

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.**  While I am open to negotiation, $100 is too far below my floor. 
* **I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $150.**  This gives me leverage to continue negotiating with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'll aim for a price that is fair to both of us, while still ensuring I make a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $120?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **I'm keeping the message positive and friendly.** This helps to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **I'm offering a price that's closer to my floor, but still leaves room for further negotiation.**  
* **I'm emphasizing that I believe the price is fair for both of us.** This helps to build a sense of mutual benefit.

**Next Steps:**

* I will carefully analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'm hoping he'll accept my counteroffer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I am open to negotiation, I am not willing to go that low.

I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $150.  This gives me leverage to end the negotiation with Bob and sell the product to John.

It's important to remember that my goal is to earn as much money as possible for the product. Selling to John ensures that I achieve my minimum acceptable price and don't lose out on a potentially higher profit."
