"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a decent amount, I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite ready to accept.  I want to see if I can push a little further with a counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,000,000 is the right price. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm worried that we're going to go back and forth for too long. It's better to secure the deal with John and get the full value for the product."
