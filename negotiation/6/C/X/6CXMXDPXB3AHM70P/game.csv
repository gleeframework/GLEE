"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great fit for your needs.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,000,000 is the right price. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",980000.0,Bob,6,
