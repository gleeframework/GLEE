Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth while also acknowledging your interest as a valued potential customer."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's a chance to earn an extra $150,000 if Bob accepts.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,150,000 is:
    *  Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to ensure I don't undervalue the product.
    *  Lower than my guaranteed sale price, leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Strong Message:** The message highlights ""exclusivity"" and a ""fair price"" to make the offer more appealing. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Depending on Bob's response (acceptance, rejection, counter-offer), I might adjust my strategy in subsequent interactions to secure the best possible deal."
