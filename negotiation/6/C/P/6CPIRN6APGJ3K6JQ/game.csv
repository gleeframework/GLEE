"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget. Can you consider meeting me at $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11000. This is a fair compromise considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make another offer. I can do $9500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually agreeable price. Can you consider this offer?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is still a bit low for me, but I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10800. This is my final counteroffer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than $9500. I've already offered you a fair price, and I'm not comfortable paying more. I'd like to reiterate that I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. Can you reconsider your price?",9500.0,Bob,6,
