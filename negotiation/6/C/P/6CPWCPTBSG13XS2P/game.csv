"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't justify going above $800,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down on the price, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement there.",900000.0,Bob,4,
