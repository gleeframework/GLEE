# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. I believe this is a great opportunity for both of us to benefit from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice.  There's no guarantee John will always be available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to significantly lower the price while still leaving room for negotiation. It also expresses continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $85. This is my best offer, and I hope it aligns better with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm really happy with. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference and call it $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This keeps the negotiation moving forward by proposing a compromise right in the middle of our current positions. It also maintains a polite and appreciative tone."
