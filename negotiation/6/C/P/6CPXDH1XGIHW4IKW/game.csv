,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is simply too low for this product. It's significantly less than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1700000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1700000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, but $1000000 is still far below the value of this product.  While I'm willing to negotiate further, I can't go lower than $1400000.  This price reflects the unique qualities and potential of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this point.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
