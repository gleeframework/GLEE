"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a better solution for both of us. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than his initial offer, it's still below what I consider the minimum acceptable price. I have more rounds to negotiate with Bob and can potentially get a higher offer. I also have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not in a rush to accept anything less than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 is still below what I'm willing to accept. Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I am still not able to meet your asking price. I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,350,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable amount. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. I still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, giving me a strong bargaining position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,400,000. I hope this helps us reach an agreement that is acceptable to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is getting closer, it's still not enough for me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a bit closer to my target price of $1,500,000. I'm aware of the possibility of selling to John at that price, which gives me confidence to hold out for a better offer from Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to come down to $1,425,000. This is a very reasonable price considering the value of the product to you. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1425000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  

We're running out of time and I'm not convinced Bob will go any higher. While $1,400,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum goal. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
