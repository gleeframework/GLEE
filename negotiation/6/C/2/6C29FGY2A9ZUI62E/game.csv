"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $125. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $115 for the product. I think that's a fair price, considering the value you mentioned earlier.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $115 still isn't quite there for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $120? This is a fair price, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,5,
