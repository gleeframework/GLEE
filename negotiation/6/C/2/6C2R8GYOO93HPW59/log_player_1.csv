"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a price closer to what it's worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer of $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still leaving room for a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a better deal. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to $90 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 89} 
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $89. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping that with only 5 rounds remaining, Bob will be more inclined to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $88 is very close to my desired price and it's getting late in the negotiation. It's better to secure this deal than to risk losing it and having to settle for John's $80 offer."
