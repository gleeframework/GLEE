"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to sell you this great product! I think you'll really like it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than $100, you can likely do better.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $92? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a bit, but it's still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Alice.  I'm still hoping for a price closer to $85. How about $88?"", ""product_price"": 88} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking for a deal, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $88. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $95, which is only $5 more than my ideal price of $90.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a chance she'll just walk away.  Since John is selling for $100, accepting Alice's offer is the best option."
