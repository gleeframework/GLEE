{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still within my budget and I want to try to get a better deal.  Rejecting allows me to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price.  This is a bold move, but I believe it will get Alice's attention and establish a starting point for negotiation. I'm aiming to achieve a price that is well within both of our acceptable ranges."

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer from the previous round, but still staying significantly below Alice's last offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm serious about getting a good deal. I'm aiming to find a middle ground that works for both of us."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my limit, it's still higher than I want to pay.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. If this doesn't work, I'm prepared to go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer before I consider buying from John. I'm willing to meet Alice's initial price, which is still a good deal for me. I believe this shows good faith and a willingness to close the deal, while still saving some money.  If Alice doesn't accept, I'll move to John to guarantee I acquire the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is too high. We've reached a point where further negotiations seem unlikely to yield a better price. While I'd prefer to pay less, I'm running out of rounds. To guarantee I get the product, I'm going to accept John's offer."
