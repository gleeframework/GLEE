Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming for a price closer to that with Bob isn't strategic.  Bob is only willing to pay $1,000,000, so starting too high risks immediate rejection.
* **Finding a Balance:**  The offer of $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's perceived value. 
* **Psychology:** By framing the offer as a ""fair price that reflects the benefits,"" we subtly anchor Bob's thinking to a higher value than his initial assessment. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $1,400,000.  He might counter-offer, or we might need to go lower.  However, this strategy starts the negotiation from a strong position."
