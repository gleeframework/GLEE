Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so he might be willing to pay a bit more to secure it.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're aiming for at least $1,200,000, so this gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **It signals your seriousness:**  By not starting at the top, it shows you're open to compromise.

This will be a good starting point to see how Bob reacts and then adjust your strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,080,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired price.  It's worth pushing for a higher price in the next round of negotiations.  We can counteroffer with a price closer to the middle ground, increasing the chances of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1115000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:**  It shows you're not simply accepting his initial proposal.
* **It's still lower than your ideal price:**  This gives you space to negotiate further if needed.
* **It's a step towards a potential agreement:**  It suggests a willingness to meet halfway. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward without closing the door on a higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While we could continue negotiating, the likelihood of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement seems low. It's more beneficial to sell the product to John at our desired price.  This ensures we achieve our financial goals and minimizes further negotiation time."
