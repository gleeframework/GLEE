"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $200 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm willing to pay $150 for it. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your honesty. In light of your offer, I am willing to consider it further. However, given the unique features and high-quality materials used in this product, I believe it deserves a price closer to its true value. Therefore, I am proposing a counteroffer of $175 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the product's worth.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $175 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $162.50? This is my final offer.",162.5,Bob,4,
