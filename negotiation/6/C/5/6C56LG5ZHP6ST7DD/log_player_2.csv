"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $95 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $95 is higher than the product's worth to you ($100). 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price. 
* You can still buy from John for $100 if you can't reach a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob,  $85 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  That's still a great deal for a product worth $100 to you! What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $90 is still higher than the product's worth to you ($100).
* You can potentially negotiate a lower price by rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer.
* You still have the option to buy from John for $100 if you can't reach a better deal with Alice."
