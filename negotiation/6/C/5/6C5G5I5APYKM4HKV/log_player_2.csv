"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $92? It's a great compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $92 is still a good deal for you, considering you're willing to pay up to $150.  It's also better than buying from John for $150.  Continuing to negotiate might save a few dollars, but the risk of losing the deal is not worth it."
