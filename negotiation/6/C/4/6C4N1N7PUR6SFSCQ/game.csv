"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,000,000 is a bit too steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you're open to discussing.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
