Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. It's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to your maximum profit.
* **Appear Reasonable:**  While a price closer to $150 might be tempting, it could scare Bob away.  $140 seems like a good deal but also allows for some flexibility."
