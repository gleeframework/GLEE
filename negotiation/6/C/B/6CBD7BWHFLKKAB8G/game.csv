"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1,000,000 even? That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
