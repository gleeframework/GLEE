"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be completely transparent, I can get a similar product elsewhere for $1,000,000.  To make this work for me, I would need you to come down to that price point. Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you've found a similar product elsewhere for $1,000,000, but I'd like to remind you that my product is unique and offers some exclusive features that set it apart. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
