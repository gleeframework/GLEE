I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in something that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you've found a similar product elsewhere for $1,000,000, but I'd like to remind you that my product is unique and offers some exclusive features that set it apart. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,025,000. It's better to secure the product from John at the known $1,000,000 price point."
