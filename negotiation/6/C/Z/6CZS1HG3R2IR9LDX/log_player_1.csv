Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a potential offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so this is your absolute lowest point.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive to Bob while maximizing your profit. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can be a bit bolder.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You acknowledge the product's value to Bob, building rapport.
* **High but Reasonable Price:**  $1,400,000 gives you a significant profit margin while still being below Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even though John is your safety net) creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one potential approach.  You could start with a higher price and be prepared to negotiate down slightly.  The key is to be confident and highlight the value of the product to Bob."
