"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $135 is higher than Bob's $120 value, but not so high that he's likely to immediately reject it.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're still well above your minimum of $150, so you have room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **It's a positive and friendly message:**  This helps to build rapport and makes Bob feel like you're trying to work with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $125 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my goal.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get a higher price. I'm not in a rush, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $130. Let's meet in the middle on this one."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $127. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $127 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still a bit low. I'm going to continue to negotiate, hoping to secure a price closer to my target of $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $127 just doesn't work for me.  Let's compromise at $129.  This is a fair price for both of us and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 129}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $129 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $126. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $126. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $126
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

I've been negotiating with Bob for several rounds, and while we're getting closer, we haven't reached a price that's acceptable to me.  The offers are still below my minimum, and I don't want to risk going any lower.

John is offering me my minimum price, which guarantees I won't lose money.  It's time to stop negotiating with Bob and sell to John for $150."
