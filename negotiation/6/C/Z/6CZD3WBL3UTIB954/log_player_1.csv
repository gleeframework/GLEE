Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $1,050,000.  Let me know what you think.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately far too low for me.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  I have a few more rounds before I need to consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  $1,125,000 is still a bit low for me, considering the product's unique value and potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This is a fair price that respects both our needs."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,190,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable with it. It's below my minimum, and I think I can still get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'm running out of rounds, though, so I'll need to think carefully about whether to sell to John if things don't go my way."
