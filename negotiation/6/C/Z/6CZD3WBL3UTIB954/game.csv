"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000.  This allows for some room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $1,050,000.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately far too low for me.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still reflects the significant worth of the product, while offering some room for compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  $1,125,000 is still a bit low for me, considering the product's unique value and potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This is a fair price that respects both our needs.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
