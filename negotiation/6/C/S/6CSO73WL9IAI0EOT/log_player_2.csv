"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is a good starting point, there's room for negotiation. I'm aiming to buy the product for significantly less than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. It makes sense to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is definitely of interest to me, but I'm working within a tight budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're working within a tight budget, Bob. However, I've done my research and I know this product is worth a lot to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to consider a price of $950,000. This is a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm fully comfortable with. I'll counter again to see if I can get her closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle on $850,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of this product."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about this product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the value this product holds. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is slowly moving towards my desired range, but I think there's still room for negotiation. We're getting close to the point where I might consider meeting her halfway, but I'll try one more time to see if she'll come down closer to $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, I am serious about this product. To show you I'm ready to make a deal, I'm willing to move up slightly. How about $875,000? That's a fair compromise in my opinion."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to move up, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm thinking of a price of $920,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the concessions I've made so far. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is clearly committed to a price above $900,000.  While I could push for another round or two, it's unlikely I'll be able to get her down to $875,000. Accepting at $920,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's offer and avoids the risk of the negotiation stalling completely."
