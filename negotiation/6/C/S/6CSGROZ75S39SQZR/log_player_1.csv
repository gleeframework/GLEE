Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 13000} 

I'm starting with a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This price is within Bob's budget and may encourage him to accept. If he rejects, I can then assess if I want to continue negotiating or sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, but it's closer to what I'm willing to accept. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I believe I can get a higher price than $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm offering $12,000. This is a compromise, as it's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. I'm hoping this will entice him to accept, as it's still a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is still lower than my initial goal, but it's getting closer. I'm happy to accept this offer, as it's above my minimum of $15,000 and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John by continuing to negotiate."
