"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm hoping to find a price that works better for both of us.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the market demand. I'm open to further discussion, but I need to see a stronger offer to move forward.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a strong offer.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $775,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, but I need to see some movement from your end. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this. Let's see if we can make a deal happen.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting close.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000 to try and finalize this.  This is a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's value.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase the offer. $800,000 is a good step, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the market demand. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",850000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price. However, to be completely transparent, $810,000 is the highest I'm willing to go. If this works for you, I'm ready to close the deal. If not, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",810000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your maximum offer. I've been considering your proposal, and I'm willing to meet you at $825,000. This is a compromise that I think works for both of us, considering the product's value and the price you're willing to pay. I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",825000.0,Alice,9,
