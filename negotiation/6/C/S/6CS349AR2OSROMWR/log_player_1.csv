I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a higher price than I'm guaranteed to get from John, but it gives me a chance to earn more. Since I don't know Bob's valuation of the product, I'm taking a calculated risk.  If he values it higher than $1,000,000, he might accept the offer. If not, I'll still be able to sell to John for $800,000."
