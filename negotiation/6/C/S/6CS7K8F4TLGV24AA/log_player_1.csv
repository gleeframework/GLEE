Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum of $80, leaving room for negotiation, but also leaves Bob a potential $5 profit, making it likely he'll consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below what I'm aiming for. There's room for negotiation, and I'll try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to settle for a price I'm not comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $3 less than my initial offer. It's also higher than John's offer, and close to my minimum acceptable price. I'll accept this offer to secure a sale."
