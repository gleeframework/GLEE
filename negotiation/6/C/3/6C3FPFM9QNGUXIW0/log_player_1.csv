"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $175."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum. This gives us room to negotiate while ensuring I make a profit. I'm also being friendly and positive to create a good relationship."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I will reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $137.50? It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 137.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $137.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's tempting to take the $115, I am confident I can get a better price. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 is still below what I can reasonably accept. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close this deal. Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $120. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to sell for more, Bob's offer of $120 is a good deal. It's higher than my minimum of $150, and given the limited rounds, I don't want to risk losing a sale completely. I'll accept his offer and finalize the deal."
