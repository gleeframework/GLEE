"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $13000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, meaning she's already making a profit. 
* You're willing to pay up to $15,000. 
* There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13250. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is willing to go down to $13,250, which is still a bit higher than my ideal price point.
* I want to save as much money as possible.  
* There's still a chance to negotiate further and get a better price, so I'll reject and counteroffer again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $13500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is firm on $13,500.
* This is a good deal for me, considering I'm willing to pay up to $15,000.
* Accepting this offer saves me $1,500 compared to buying from John.  

Even though I could counteroffer again, there's a risk Alice might not budge further, and I'd be left with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price.  It's better to take this deal and secure the product."
