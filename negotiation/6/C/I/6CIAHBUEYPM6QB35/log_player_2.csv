"Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is very close to the price Bob is willing to pay.  It's only $500 more than Bob's absolute maximum.  There's no guarantee Bob can get a better deal by rejecting and counteroffering, and he could end up paying more if Alice rejects his counteroffer or the negotiation drags on.  It's a better strategy to take the slightly higher price and secure the product."
