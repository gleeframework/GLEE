Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for your product. This still allows me to save some money while acquiring the item.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $1,070,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll see if I can get him up to $1,090,000 in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to lower my offer to $1,090,000, which is a fair compromise.  It allows both of us to come away satisfied with the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1090000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob are getting too close to my minimum acceptable price. It's better to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This guarantees I reach my target and avoid risking a further decrease in price."
