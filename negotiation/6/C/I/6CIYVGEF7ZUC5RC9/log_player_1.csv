"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $10,000. This gives us a good starting point for negotiation and leaves room for potential compromise.  I'm also aware that I have a backup option in John, so I'm not afraid to be firm if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $8,500, I believe I can do better. I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price point of $9,500. I also know that selling to John is always an option if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $9,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still keeping the price above my minimum threshold. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not yet satisfied.  I still think I can get a better deal, and I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I'm also aware that I have a backup option in John, so I'm not feeling pressured to close a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $8,900. This is a small concession, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeping the price above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to finally accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough decision, as I'm still below my target price of $9,500. However,  Bob's offer of $8,800 is only $100 away from my minimum threshold of $8,700, and I'm already on round 6.  There's a good chance that further negotiation will just lead to more rounds of back-and-forth without a significant increase in price. Additionally, selling to John would only net me $8,000.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most advantageous choice in this situation."
