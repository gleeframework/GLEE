"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $140?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $140 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $150? I'm confident you'll find it's worth the value it brings.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget constraints. I would like to propose a price of $130 for the product. This is still higher than my initial offer, but it is the best I can afford at this time.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us.  To be honest, anything under $145 just isn't going to work for me. If you're willing to meet me there, we have a deal.",145.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I am willing to pay up to $140 for the product. This is the highest amount I can afford without exceeding my budget. I hope this offer is acceptable.",140.0,Bob,6,
