Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this is a competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $14,000 allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price closer to $15,000. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit from Bob while ensuring a sale regardless."
