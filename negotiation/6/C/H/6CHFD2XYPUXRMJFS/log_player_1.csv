"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This leaves room for negotiation, but also ensures I get a good price for the product. I want to maximize my profits but also want to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can come to a more mutually agreeable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price to $90.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. It's a good compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, hopefully leading to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $87 is only $2 less than my desired $89. It's getting close to my bottom line, and I don't want to risk further negotiation leading to a lower offer.  Accepting his offer ensures I get a decent price, and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
