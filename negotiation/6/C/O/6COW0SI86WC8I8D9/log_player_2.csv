"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

$9,000 is a good price, but it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $8,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within a range that could potentially be profitable for both parties. This initial counteroffer sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is closer to my target, it's still worth seeing if I can get Alice to go down further. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to potentially save another $500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already moved from $9,000 to $8,500, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  A counteroffer of $8,200 shows I'm serious about getting a good deal, but it's still a reasonable price for Alice to consider. This incrementally lower offer keeps the pressure on without risking a total breakdown in negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $8,400, which is only $200 more than my last counteroffer. At this point, the potential savings by continuing to negotiate are minimal.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a good deal without risking further rounds of potentially fruitless negotiations."
