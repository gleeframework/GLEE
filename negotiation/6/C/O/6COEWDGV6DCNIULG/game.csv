"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,800 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,150?  I'm confident this is still a good value for you, considering the product's worth to you. Let's try to find a compromise.",11150.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $11,000? That's the highest I can go, considering the product's worth to me. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",11000.0,Bob,4,
