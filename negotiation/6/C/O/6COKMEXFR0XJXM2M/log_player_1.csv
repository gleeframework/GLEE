I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This gives me a potential profit of $300,000 over my minimum acceptable price.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm aiming for a high price, but still leaving room for negotiation if he's interested. If he rejects, I can still sell to John for $1,200,000."
