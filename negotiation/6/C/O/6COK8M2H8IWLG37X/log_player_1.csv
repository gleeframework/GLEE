"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000. This should make the offer appealing to Bob, while still giving me room to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. I still have 8 rounds left, and I can always sell to John if I'm not satisfied with the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground between my last offer and Bob's offer. This price is still above my minimum value and could be appealing to Bob since it's closer to his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,875?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum value, $8,875 is still not acceptable.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a little higher. I still have 6 rounds left, and I can always sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,875 is still too low for me.  Let's try $9,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000, which is slightly higher than Bob's last offer and closer to my minimum value. It's a good compromise that might convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is the most I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum value, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 than risk getting stuck with a lower price."
