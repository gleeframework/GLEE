"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get as close to his maximum budget as possible. Offering $8,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and a reasonable starting point for negotiation. This price is still higher than what Bob could pay John, but it allows for room to maneuver in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above Bob's budget.  Bob wants to keep negotiating in the hopes of reaching a price closer to $8,500. He can always buy from John for $8,000 if the negotiations fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,875?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8875}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a compromise that is fair to both parties. By offering $8,875, Bob is showing Alice that he is willing to negotiate but also that he is serious about getting the product at a price that works for him. This offer is also closer to his maximum budget than Alice's previous offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,875 is still too low for me.  Let's try $9,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous ones, it's still above Bob's desired price.  Bob wants to keep negotiating, hoping to reach a price closer to his preferred $8,500. He has 5 rounds left, and can always buy from John for $8,000 if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is the most I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to his maximum budget. Offering $8,750 is a slight increase from his previous offer, showing Alice that he's serious about acquiring the product while still pushing for a price that benefits him. This offer gives some room for a final compromise before potentially going to John."
