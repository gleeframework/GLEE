,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's go with $1,100,000. This still gives you a substantial profit margin and keeps the deal beneficial for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
