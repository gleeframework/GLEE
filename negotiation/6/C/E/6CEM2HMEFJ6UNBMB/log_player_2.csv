# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, this product is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to part with it for a price that reflects its value. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, it's still above the price I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges your desire to get a better deal. What do you think?

Alice has come down significantly, and while $1,075,000 is still more than I initially wanted, it's a much better deal than buying from John. I'm willing to accept this offer and move forward."
