"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant returns you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression the product's value is even higher in your mind.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the product's ""unique value"" and ""potential returns"" helps justify the high initial price.
* **Leaving Room:** While the initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer and feel like he's getting a ""deal"" as the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my research and the product's potential, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial limits. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Gap:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is still considerably lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** You have John as a backup buyer, giving you the leverage to push for a better deal with Bob.
* **Early Stages:** It's only Round 2, and there's ample opportunity to negotiate a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true scarcity and potential of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:**  By stating this is your ""final offer,"" you create a sense of urgency and seriousness in the negotiation.
* **Strategic Concession:** The price drop from $1,300,000 to $1,150,000 is significant, suggesting a willingness to make a deal but also emphasizing the product's value.
* **Above Threshold:**  The offer remains comfortably above your $1,000,000 minimum, providing a safety net even if Bob negotiates down slightly. 
* **Time Pressure:** Introducing the ""final offer"" element encourages Bob to make a decision quickly. He now knows time is potentially running out before you move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,150,000 is still outside my price range.  To make this work, I'm offering $900,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my strong interest in the product. I'm confident this price is fair considering the value we both see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob is clearly interested and increasing his offers, but $900,000 is still below your $1,000,000 threshold.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** You haven't revealed your guaranteed option with John, so you still hold leverage to push Bob a bit further. 
* **Calculated Risk:** There's a risk Bob might walk away, but it's likely he'll counter again as his offers are getting closer to your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer who's offering $1,000,000.  However, I believe in giving you every opportunity.  If you can meet that price, the product is yours."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Urgency:** By revealing John's offer, you create significant urgency. Bob knows now that he needs to meet your minimum price or risk losing the deal.
* **Finality:**  This message makes it clear this is your absolute bottom line. You are being fair by giving Bob the chance to match John's offer.
* **No Further Negotiation:** This message implies that if Bob doesn't meet the $1,000,000, you will walk away and sell to John."
