"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,150,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a midpoint between Alice's desired price and Bob's maximum budget. It shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a better price. Hopefully, this will encourage Alice to negotiate further rather than immediately going to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for improvement. It's worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to John's offer.  Bob can try to push for a lower price, as Alice has already demonstrated flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise.  He's aiming for a price closer to his desired range, but still leaving room for further negotiation.  By incrementally increasing the offer, Bob aims to  find a middle ground with Alice before having to resort to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is now very close to Bob's desired price range.  It's more advantageous for Bob to accept this offer than to continue negotiating and risk Alice rejecting his counteroffer again. If Bob rejects, Alice might go back to her previous offer of $1,100,000, making this offer the best option for Bob to save money.  Furthermore, continuing to negotiate risks having to buy from John at a much higher price."
