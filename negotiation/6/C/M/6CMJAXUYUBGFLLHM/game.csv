"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $5,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",7000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to your offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $6,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",6500.0,Alice,5,
