Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he's still willing to pay less. He can try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. It's a compromise that I think works for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.

Bob should buy from John. Alice's offer of $12,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $12,000. While further negotiation is possible, it might take more time and effort. It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John and avoid further haggling."
