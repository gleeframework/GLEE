"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll be happy with the price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $950,000? That's a substantial offer and demonstrates my seriousness about purchasing this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
