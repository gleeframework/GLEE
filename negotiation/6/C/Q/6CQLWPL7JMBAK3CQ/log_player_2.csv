You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,125. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident that we can both be happy with this deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,125.  It's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $8,000 than risk Alice sticking to her price or missing out on the product entirely."
