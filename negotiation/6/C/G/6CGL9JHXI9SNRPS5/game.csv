"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for it.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125 for this product. It's still a great deal, and I believe it's fair considering the value.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $125 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $117.50?  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",117.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $122.50 for this product. It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can both be happy with this price.",122.5,Alice,5,
