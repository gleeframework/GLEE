"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price of similar products.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $18,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $20,000?",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, $20,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $19,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this revised offer?",19000.0,Bob,4,
