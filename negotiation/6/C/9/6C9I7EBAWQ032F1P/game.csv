"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,050,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This would be a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's finalize this and get things moving.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
