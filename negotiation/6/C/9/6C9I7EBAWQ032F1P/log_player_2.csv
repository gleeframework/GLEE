Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,050,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This would be a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's finalize this and get things moving.

It's unlikely Alice will go any lower, and John offers the same price. It's time to cut negotiations and secure the product at your target price."
