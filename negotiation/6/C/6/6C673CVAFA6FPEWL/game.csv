"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential returns you'll see.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However,  $1,100,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle somewhere around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations here.  While I want to find a way for you to benefit from this product, I can't go as low as $750,000. My final offer is $975,000. This is a firm price and reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",975000.0,Alice,5,
