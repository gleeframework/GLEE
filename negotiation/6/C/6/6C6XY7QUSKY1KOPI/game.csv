"Alice,  $1,750,000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's start with this offer and see where we can go from there.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,200,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the true value of this product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that respects both of our positions.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,450,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $1,450,000 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,375,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",1375000.0,Bob,6,
