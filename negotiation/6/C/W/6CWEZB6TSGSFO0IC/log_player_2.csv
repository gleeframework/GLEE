Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I come down to $11,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and a fair price for me.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
