Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's in excellent condition and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation, as the product is worth $15,000 to Bob. This allows for a potential win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is a decent offer, it's still below the value of the product to me.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I come down to $11,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and a fair price for me.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000}
