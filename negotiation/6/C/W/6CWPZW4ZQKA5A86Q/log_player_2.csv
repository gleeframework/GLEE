"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $95
* **Your maximum willingness to pay:** $120
* **John's price:** $120

Since Alice's offer is lower than your maximum willingness to pay and lower than John's price, it's in your best interest to accept Alice's offer. You save $25 compared to buying from John."
