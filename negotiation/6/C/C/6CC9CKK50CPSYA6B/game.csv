"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're firm on the price, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $70? That's the highest I can go.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $70 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $75? This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",75.0,Alice,5,
