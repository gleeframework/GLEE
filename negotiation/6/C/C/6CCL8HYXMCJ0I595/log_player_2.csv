"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. Let's start with a competitive offer of $1,400,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a lower price to make it work. How about we start at $1,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $1,000,000 is significantly lower than Alice's offer, it establishes a strong starting point for negotiation. It leaves us room to move upwards while aiming for a price well below her initial offer.
* **Expressing Interest:** The message conveys that we are serious about purchasing but need a more agreeable price. This encourages Alice to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has now offered her lowest acceptable price.  It matches her product valuation, meaning she won't go any lower.  While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll hold firm, and we'd risk reaching no agreement. It's best to accept this offer to secure the product at a price significantly below John's offer and Alice's initial offer."
