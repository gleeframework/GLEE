(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. It's better to reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move, showing my willingness to negotiate while also making it clear that I'm not willing to pay her asking price. I'm hoping this will prompt Alice to reconsider her price and come down to a number closer to my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get a better price. I'm also considering the possibility of buying from John if I can't get a more favorable deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it significantly below Alice's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while maintaining my position that I'm not willing to pay her asking price. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be closer to her acceptable price point and lead to a faster resolution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but getting closer. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as there is still room for a more favorable deal. I'm also mindful of the remaining rounds and the possibility of buying from John if I can't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making my final push with this counteroffer. It's exactly my budget limit, and it demonstrates my strong interest in buying the product. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll likely have to move on to John, but I'm hoping she recognizes the value of a quick deal and accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. With only three rounds remaining, the time for negotiating is running out. It's more prudent to accept the known value of John's offer and secure the product for $10,000. This avoids further negotiation and guarantees a purchase within my budget."
