Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to secure a good price while leaving room for negotiation. Bob knows the product is worth less to him, but I'm confident that he'll see the value in owning it and will be willing to negotiate."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not yet willing to settle. There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'm still holding out for a bit more, I'm starting to feel the pressure. We're nearing the end of our rounds, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal. John's offer is a good fallback, but I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob. Accepting Bob's offer would allow me to secure a significant profit while ensuring the product finds a buyer."
