Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and while I value it at $120, I'm willing to offer it to you for $135. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $135 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Acceptable Minimum:** This price is still significantly above your minimum ($120), ensuring a good profit even if Bob negotiates down. 
* **Clear Value Proposition:**  The message highlights Bob's potential gain, making the offer more enticing."
