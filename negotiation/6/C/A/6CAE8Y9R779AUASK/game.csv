"Hi Alice, $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 right now. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I'm ready to buy if we can agree on that.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $92. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",92.0,Alice,5,
