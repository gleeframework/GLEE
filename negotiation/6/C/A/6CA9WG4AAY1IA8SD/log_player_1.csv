{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob is the best way to maximize potential profit. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering the product slightly below John's price ($1,150,000) creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob.
* **Understanding Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. Offering it at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above his perceived value.
* **Limited-Time Offer:**  Mentioning other interested buyers adds pressure and encourages Bob to make a decision quickly.

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
