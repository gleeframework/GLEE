Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but still potentially attractive to Bob since the product is worth $150 to him. I'll be prepared to negotiate further if needed, but I want to see if I can secure a good price right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $140 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my desired price and not worth settling for at this point. I'll proceed to the next round and see if I can negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $160. This is a compromise from my initial price of $175, but still leaves some room for profit. It's also a better price than Bob's offer of $140, and might be more appealing to him considering the value he places on the product. I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement on this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $150. Bob's offer of $145 is still below my desired price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Since John is offering my minimum acceptable price, it's the best option for me right now."
