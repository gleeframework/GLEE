"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm really looking to get this for $100, but I'm willing to compromise and offer $110. Let's try to find a middle ground.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $115, but I'm not going any lower than that. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
