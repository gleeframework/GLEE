Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90.  It's a great deal and I think you'll really enjoy it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's better to sell to Bob for $80 than to John for the same price."
