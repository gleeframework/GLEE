Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're getting more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's space to negotiate up to a mutually agreeable price.
* **It's not too aggressive:** Starting too high might scare Bob off, making it harder to reach an agreement. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
