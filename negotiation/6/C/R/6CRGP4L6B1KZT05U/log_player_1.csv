{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11,999. I think it would be a great fit for you and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, it's always best to try for a higher profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,999 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially bringing the final price closer to your desired amount.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  The price $11,999 feels significantly lower than $12,000, potentially making it more appealing to Bob.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, by offering a price close to your minimum, you maximize your potential earnings while still having the safety net of John's offer."
