"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  While I recognize the product's value, I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  This represents a fair price given my financial constraints and the product's potential for me. I'm confident this offer is mutually beneficial.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,900,000? This reflects my understanding of its worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, which is a fair reflection of the value I see in the product. This offer demonstrates my sincere interest in acquiring it. Let's find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
