"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the value of the product and still allows me to meet my own financial needs.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to me.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
