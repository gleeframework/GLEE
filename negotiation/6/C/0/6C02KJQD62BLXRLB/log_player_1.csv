Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you shouldn't sell for less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for both of you.
* **One Shot:** You only have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to earn more.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal. Offering a price slightly below his maximum valuation increases your chances of success.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Considering its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair and mutually beneficial."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""mutually beneficial.""
* **Price:** $1,400,000 allows Bob a $100,000 discount from his perceived value, making it an attractive offer. This price also nets you a $200,000 profit over your guaranteed sale to John. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Have a clear idea of your lowest acceptable price.
* **Relationship:** While maximizing profit is important, consider the long-term implications. If you drive too hard a bargain, it might impact future dealings with Bob."
