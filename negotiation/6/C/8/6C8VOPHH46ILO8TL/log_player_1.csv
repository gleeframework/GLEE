"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a 20% markup on the product's value to Bob. This gives him room to negotiate, but also ensures I'm making a profit. I'll keep an eye on the number of rounds and the progress of negotiations, and be prepared to make concessions or switch to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd like to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000, my minimum.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $11,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum and leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $9,500 is still below it. I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer. I have limited rounds left and I don't want to be forced to sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a significant drop from my last offer, but it's still above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer.  The rounds are getting shorter, and I don't want to risk having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is finally at my minimum. I've reached my goal of earning at least $10,000 for the product, and accepting this offer is the best choice.  While I could potentially earn more in the remaining rounds, there's no guarantee of success, and I'm satisfied with this outcome."
