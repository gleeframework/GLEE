"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,100,000. This is a significant price point that represents a great value for you.  I'm confident this product will be extremely beneficial for your business.  Let me know if you're interested! If not, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is under your $1,000,000 limit, you have a better option. John is willing to sell you the same product for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can save $100,000 and achieve your goal of getting the product at the best possible price."
