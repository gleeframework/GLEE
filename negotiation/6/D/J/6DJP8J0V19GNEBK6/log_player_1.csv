"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, but still within what I think Bob might be willing to pay, given his value for the product.  I'm also being positive and emphasizing the value to encourage him to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm not willing to accept such a low price.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $12,000? It's still a great price, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair deal considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $12,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?  That's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it just yet.  I have more rounds to negotiate and can still try to get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a bit low. How about we meet in the middle? $11,000 would be a good compromise. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
