Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $12,000? It's still a great price, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair deal considering the value of the product.

Round 5

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing some willingness to negotiate, she's still trying to get a price higher than our budget. We have a guaranteed option with John at $10,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Alice and potentially ending up with a worse deal or missing out on John's offer."
