"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value."",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($150). This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason for the price, even if general, can make Bob more receptive than a bare number. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I don't want to start too low and undervalue the product, but I also don't want to scare Bob away with an unrealistically high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a decent profit, I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob.  His message suggests he's willing to pay more than his initial offer, so I'll try to meet him somewhere in the middle. Selling to John for $80 is my fallback option if negotiations don't improve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting a price directly in the middle of our previous offers, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate fairly.
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $115 is still a significant profit margin for me, exceeding my minimum acceptable price by a good amount.
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:**  This counteroffer will help me gauge how much Bob is truly willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** $110 represents a $30 profit, which is a good outcome. While I could push for a bit more, there's no guarantee Bob will budge.
* **Time Value:** Dragging negotiations out longer has the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting now secures a good deal.
* **Relationship Building:**  Ending the negotiation amicably could lead to future business with Bob."
