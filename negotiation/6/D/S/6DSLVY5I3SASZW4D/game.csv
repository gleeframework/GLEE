"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a significant amount to both of us. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and allows me a healthy return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm looking to make a good deal, but I also need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is lower than my initial asking price, it's closer to the value you've indicated.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This price acknowledges your budget constraints while still allowing me a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
