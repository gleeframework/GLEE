"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still reflects the value of the product for you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $1,100,000 is slightly beyond my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This amount still respects the value of the product while allowing me to stay within my financial limits.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
