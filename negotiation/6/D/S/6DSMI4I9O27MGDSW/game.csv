"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the value it brings to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I do think this product is valuable, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget.  How about we bring it down to $700,000?  I think that's a fair price that would be mutually beneficial.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,000,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. This product is truly a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth more than that to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's really the top of my budget.  What do you say, can we make this work?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still think the product is worth more than $750,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $750,000, which would be $875,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this exceptional product.",875000.0,Alice,5,
