Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,000,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. This product is truly a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth more than that to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still think the product is worth more than $750,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $750,000, which would be $875,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to come down much further, and waiting around for a slightly better deal isn't worth the risk of her going up or the negotiation failing.  $800,000 is the guaranteed price."
