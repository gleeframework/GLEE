Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
```

Here's why this offer makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could net you a slightly higher profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is set just below your guaranteed sale price, creating a sense of urgency and value for Bob. 
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** While this is your initial offer, there's a slight buffer should Bob try to negotiate down a bit."
