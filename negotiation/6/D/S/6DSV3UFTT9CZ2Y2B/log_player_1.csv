{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$130 offer:** This price is higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), giving me room for potential negotiation.
* **Friendly message:**  Starting with a friendly message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Highlighting value:** Mentioning that the product is ""fantastic"" and ""perfect for you"" can subtly suggest its worth. 

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming for a price that's within the ""zone of possible agreement"" (ZOPA) - the range where both of us can benefit. This initial offer is high enough that I might make a profit but low enough that Bob might be willing to negotiate. 

I'm also keeping in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John for $150 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While it's tempting to accept his offer, it's ultimately not in my best interest. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit:**  $100 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I'd be losing out on a potential profit.
* **Negotiation:**  I still have room to negotiate with Bob. Rejecting his offer shows that I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **John:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John for $150, which provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through. 

**Next Steps:** I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm proposing $120, which is halfway between my initial offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $100.
* **Compromise:** The message emphasizes a willingness to compromise, making it more likely Bob will consider my offer.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing $120 as a ""fair price for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of equity.

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a compromise:**  This counteroffer moves closer to Bob's desired price while still allowing me to make a profit.
* **Increased chances of acceptance:** By demonstrating flexibility, I'm increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  This counteroffer maintains my leverage, as I still have the option to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than my ideal outcome.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and attempt one more round of negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:** There's still a chance that I can convince Bob to pay a little more.
* **Limited downside:** I'm not losing anything by rejecting Bob's offer.  I can always sell to John for $150.
* **Building leverage:**  By continuing to negotiate, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell at Bob's price.

**Next Steps:** I'll make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get as close to my minimum acceptable price as possible."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  $115 is my final offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:** I'm clearly stating this is my final offer, signaling to Bob that further negotiation is unlikely. 
* **Compromise:** I'm offering $115, a small compromise from my previous offer.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing a ""fair price"" for both of us. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the deal:** This offer is closer to Bob's desired price, making it more likely that he'll accept.
* **Minimizing risk:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to sell to John, which is still a favorable outcome.
* **Finality:** This offer creates a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to accept."
