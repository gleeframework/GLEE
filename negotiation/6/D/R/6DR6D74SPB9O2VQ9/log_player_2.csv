"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the price you'd pay from John ($1,400,000 vs. $1,500,000). This represents a substantial saving. There's no guarantee you'll get a better price in further negotiations, and you risk losing the opportunity altogether."
