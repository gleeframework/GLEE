"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $18,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's maximum price.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is $5,000 lower than Alice's initial offer, and still within Bob's budget.  This is a significant reduction, and it's likely that Alice will either accept it or make a counteroffer closer to Bob's desired price.  It's important to note that this is just a starting point, and the negotiation will likely continue from here."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $15,000, but it's closer to what he is willing to pay. It's still worth continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between Bob's previous offer of $13,000 and Alice's latest offer of $16,500.  It's likely to be closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price, but still within Bob's budget. It's a strong offer, but it allows room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $15,000. At this point, it's better to buy the product from John for $15,000, as this is the best possible deal for Bob. Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a lower price, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the opportunity to buy the product from John."
