"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's a good starting point, it's still above the product's value to you. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so you have time to try to get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is still an option.** If the negotiations with Alice don't go well, you can always buy from John. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you're signaling your willingness to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This would give us both a good profit margin and secure a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that should benefit both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still slightly high.** While it's closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation to get a better deal.
* **You have time to negotiate.** You have 7 rounds remaining, so there's no need to rush into accepting this offer.
* **Buying from John is still a backup option.** If the negotiations with Alice fail, you can always purchase the product from John.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're serious about getting the best possible price. You can then counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm ready to pay $860,000. This price is fair for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go below $880,000. This is the minimum I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll offer it to you for $872,500. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $872,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $872,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your desired price.** While it's not your ideal price, it's only $2,500 higher than your previous counteroffer. 
* **You have limited time.** You're already at Round 5, and buying from John would be significantly more expensive. 
* **The deal is close.** Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, and further negotiation may take you further from the deal.

Accepting Alice's offer ensures you secure the product while keeping your costs relatively low. You've made progress in the negotiation, and it's worth accepting this offer to avoid further rounds and the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
