"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice's initial offer is the maximum price I'm willing to pay, there's no benefit to negotiating further. Buying from John guarantees the same price and eliminates the risk of a prolonged negotiation."
