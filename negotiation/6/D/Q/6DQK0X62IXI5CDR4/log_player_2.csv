I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could potentially continue negotiating, the current price of $925,000 is a good deal and saves him $275,000 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation may not yield a significantly better price, and he risks losing the deal altogether."
