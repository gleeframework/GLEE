Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! This product sounds interesting. However, $15000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. Would you be willing to consider $12000? I'm genuinely interested, and I think this price would be fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
