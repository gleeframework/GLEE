"Thanks for the offer, Alice! This product sounds interesting. However, $15000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. Would you be willing to consider $12000? I'm genuinely interested, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12000. I'm willing to consider a compromise. How about we meet at $13500? I think this is a fair price that balances our interests.",13500.0,Alice,3,
