Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:** I'm starting with $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's estimated value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the product for Bob. 
* **Strategy:** This offer leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential counteroffer. It's a good starting point to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value it brings. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm rejecting Bob's offer to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a little lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm proposing a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a compromise, moving halfway from my previous offer of $1,000,000 to Bob's offer of $850,000. 
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone, acknowledging Bob's offer while stating my own position. I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing my counteroffer as a meeting in the middle.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate but also indicates that I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below my minimum. It's likely to encourage Bob to come up a little more to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. I'm serious about purchasing, so let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come up to $900,000, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to that target, it's likely that further negotiation with Bob will be lengthy and uncertain. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price. However, it's worth considering that further negotiation with Bob might yield a higher price, even if it's a risk.

In this situation, I'm choosing to **accept Bob's offer** because:

* It's a good deal, considering the risk of further negotiation.
* It saves time and energy compared to continuing the negotiation.
* It's still within a reasonable range for me, and I'm willing to take the profit."
