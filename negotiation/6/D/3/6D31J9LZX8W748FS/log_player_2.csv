# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this compromise is worth considering. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is only $75,000 more than buying from John. While it's not the absolute lowest price, the difference is minimal, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer is a good compromise, securing the product while keeping the cost within a reasonable margin."
