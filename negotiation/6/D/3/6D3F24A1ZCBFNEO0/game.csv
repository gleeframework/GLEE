"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 price point. Would you consider reducing the price to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,075,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the value of your product, but I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose $1,025,000 as a compromise. This price still allows me to acquire the product without exceeding my financial limits.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
