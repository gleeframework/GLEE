"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's value.  You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  There's also the possibility of Alice getting desperate in later rounds and lowering her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to Alice's value of $800,000.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  It also gives me room to potentially compromise in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, but it's still above her perceived value.  I'm not yet ready to accept the offer, as I believe there's still potential for a better price.  I'll continue to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 775000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, moving closer to Alice's last offer but still leaving room for negotiation. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm not desperate to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I believe I can continue to negotiate a lower price.  I'm also aware that buying from John for $1,000,000 is always an option, which gives me leverage in these negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has clearly shown a willingness to compromise, and her last offer was only $20,000 above her value.  This counteroffer matches her value, making it a fair price for both of us.  If she rejects this offer, I'm ready to move closer to the $1,000,000 price from John, demonstrating my willingness to walk away."
