"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, which might make him more willing to pay a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's tempting to take the $8,000, it's my minimum acceptable price, and I have the potential to earn more by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate:**  I believe I can get a better price than $8,000, and I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer maintains my leverage and lets him know I'm not desperate to sell at his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $8,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This product really is worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm also offering a new price that's closer to his offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value again:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Seeking compromise:** I'm suggesting a middle ground, making the offer more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $9,000 is the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:**  $9,000 is very close to my initial target of $10,000, and significantly better than my minimum of $8,000.
* **Risk of losing a deal:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Bob walking away or reaching a stalemate.
* **Limited rounds:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to be strategic to maximize my earnings.  Accepting this offer is a safe and profitable choice."
