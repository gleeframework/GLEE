"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is significantly above my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Appeal to Value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, hoping to incentivize him to accept a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm phrasing the offer in a way that suggests I'm open to negotiation, which may encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below the $8,000 I'm willing to accept. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** I have 8 rounds remaining, and it's likely I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **No immediate risk:**  John's offer is my safety net, so I'm not in a rush to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  I'm confident this product will be worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's in the middle of our previous offers, showing willingness to negotiate while still getting closer to my desired price.
* **Reiterate value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, trying to convince him that a slightly higher price is still a good deal for him. 
* **Maintain flexibility:** This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** We're getting closer, but there's room for a better deal. With 6 rounds remaining, I can continue negotiating.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $8,750 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:**  I'm continuing to compromise, but I'm still above my minimum price.  
* **Highlighting value again:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, emphasizing that $9,000 is a good deal for him.
* **Creating urgency (implicitly):**  I'm showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also making it clear that I'm not going to continue this indefinitely. This might encourage Bob to make a higher counteroffer."

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're very close to a deal.  How about we split the difference again?  I'm willing to go down to $8,900.  This is a fair price considering your value for this product, and it gets us both closer to an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Showing urgency:**  I'm emphasizing that we're close to a deal, hoping to pressure Bob into accepting.

* **Reiterating value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm still slightly above my minimum, leaving space for a final counteroffer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,750. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk of going lower:**  With only two rounds left, there's a real risk of Bob continuing to lowball me.  I've already come down significantly. 
* **No guarantee of acceptance:**  Even if I counteroffer, there's no guarantee Bob will accept, and I might end up with John's offer anyway. 
* **Minimize potential loss:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price.  I've tried to get a better deal with Bob, but it's not looking promising. 

It's time to cut my losses and take the sure thing."
