"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to you and $8,000 to Alice, there's room for a better deal.  You can make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $15,000 to you.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is a good price considering the product is worth $15,000 to you.  Accepting this offer saves you $4,000 compared to buying from John."
