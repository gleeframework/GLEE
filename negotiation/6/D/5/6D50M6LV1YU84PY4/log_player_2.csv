# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I've done some research and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair deal, but $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise again. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is a good middle ground, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?

Reason: While Alice is slowly coming down on price, she's unlikely to reach my ideal price point. I can get the product for a sure $8,000 from John, which is better than risking further negotiation with Alice and potentially ending up with a price closer to $8,500."
