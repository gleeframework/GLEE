``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's  a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This gives Bob some wiggle room and hopefully encourages him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. Based on my budget, I would like to propose an offer of $130 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to get a bit more for the product. How about $135?  This is a good compromise and would still leave us both feeling satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
