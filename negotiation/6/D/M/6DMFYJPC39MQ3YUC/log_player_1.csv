{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $17,000 for it.  It's a fair price, considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I want to leave some room to bargain down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $17,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $15,000.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $15,500.  This is still a great deal for a product worth $15,000.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm coming down to $15,500. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping that this will be an agreeable price for both of us."
