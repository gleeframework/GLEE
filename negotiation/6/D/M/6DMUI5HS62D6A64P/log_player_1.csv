``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:**  I've set my initial price at $1,400,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but still within the realm of a possible deal. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Starting high allows for some room to negotiate downward if needed. 
* **Flexibility:**  The message conveys my willingness to discuss the price and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as an alternative buyer provides leverage and helps me avoid settling for a price I'm not comfortable with."
