"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price that makes sense for my budget. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? ",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back to me.  While your offer is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny.  Let's try $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point that works for both of us.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for what I have budgeted for this purchase. I'm willing to increase my offer to $725,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations.  While I'm willing to work with you, $725,000 is simply too far off from what this product is worth. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm offering to reduce the price to $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value it brings to your business and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your budget, and I'm committed to making this deal work. However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable product. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This offer reflects the value it brings to your business, and it's a price I believe we can both agree on. Let's close this deal, Bob.
