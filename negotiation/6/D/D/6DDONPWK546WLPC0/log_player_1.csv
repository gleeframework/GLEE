Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so $1,400,000 gives him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** You've set your minimum at $1,500,000, so you have some room to come down if needed.
* **It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate:** By starting slightly lower than your desired price, you show Bob that you're open to discussion. 

Let's see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is capped at $800,000. Would you be willing to consider that?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While we want to make a deal, accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for us.  We'll counter with a price closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $800,000 is significantly below the value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This represents a considerable discount and allows us to both benefit from this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Stay above your minimum:**  $1,100,000 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring you won't lose money.
* **Show flexibility:** It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still protecting your interests. 
* **Highlight value:** By emphasizing the value of the product, you remind Bob of the potential benefits he'll receive.

Let's see how Bob responds to this counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to our minimum, it's still not a price we're comfortable accepting. We have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, so there's no urgency to settle for less.  We'll counter Bob again with a price closer to our desired range."

* **Highlight value again:**  You continue to emphasize the value of the product to reinforce its worth.

Let's see if Bob finally accepts or decides to walk away!"
