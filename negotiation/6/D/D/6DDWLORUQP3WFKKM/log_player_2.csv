"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first. You can likely get a better deal than $90, especially since you know the product is worth $80 to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm still a bit above $80. How about we meet in the middle at $92? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is still trying to get a higher price than she's willing to sell for. You can likely get a better deal by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $92 is still a little too high for me.  I'm still very interested, but  I can only go up to $87. How about we try that? "", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $89? It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to a price that's close to your limit, and you're only 4 rounds away from having to buy from John for a higher price. It's a good deal for you, so it's best to accept the offer."
