"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product for $1,100,000. It's a steal for a product worth so much to you.  Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000?  It's a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the sale.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000.  This reflects the value of the product to you and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,050,000, which would be $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a compromise and buy the product for $1,000,000. Can you accept this offer?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
