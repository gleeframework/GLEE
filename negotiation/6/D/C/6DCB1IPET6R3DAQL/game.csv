"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product, considering its value and the market conditions.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,150,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth significantly more.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,250,000.  This price is still fair considering its value, and it allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know if you're interested.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,250,000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
