"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to buy it for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $130, but I'm still a bit over my budget. How about $125? I'm really keen on the product, but I can't go any higher than that.",125.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $127.50. It's a small step down from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",127.5,Alice,5,
