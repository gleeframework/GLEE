Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and I believe a fair price is $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting significantly higher leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit margin for Alice. 
* **Anchoring:** By offering a high initial price, we're ""anchoring"" the negotiation in our favor. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counter-offer is likely to be higher than if we had started lower.
* **Backup plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 from John, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. If Alice wants to guarantee the sale, offering a price closer to $1,000,000 would be a safer approach."
