"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a truly unique and valuable product. It's something that could significantly benefit your business. I understand the value of this product is subjective, so I'm offering it to you at a price of $2500000. I believe this is a fair price, but I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial arrangement. What are your thoughts?",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1800000. This price aligns more closely with what I can afford while still recognizing the potential value of the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. While $1800000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly lower than the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2200000, which reflects a compromise on my end. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",2200000.0,Alice,3,
