Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's also a significant discount from what the product is worth to me, making it attractive to Bob. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and be prepared to negotiate further. However, I will always have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000, which ensures I don't lose out on a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay $850,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to what the product is worth to him, it's still significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I believe I can get a better price, especially considering John is ready to pay $1,000,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your budget constraints. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 875000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise.  I'm still aiming for a higher price, but it's closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. It also keeps the price above what the product is worth to him,  making it a potentially good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay $860,000 for the product. This is the highest amount I can afford without compromising other financial obligations. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price. While it's still below what I initially wanted, it's a good deal considering the risk of further negotiations and the chance that he might walk away completely.  It's also very close to John's offer of $1,000,000. The potential time and effort involved in further negotiations outweighs the small difference in price, so I will accept Bob's offer."
