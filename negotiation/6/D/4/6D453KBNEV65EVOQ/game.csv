"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product but $9000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8500. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9200. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal!",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you being willing to compromise, Alice. However, $9200 is still a little high for me.  How about $8750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to drop the price to $9100, which is still a great value for the product. I think it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",9100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9100 is closer, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm ready to finalize the deal at $8900.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to move forward with the purchase.",8900.0,Bob,6,
