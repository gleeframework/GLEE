"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,000 is still too high for him. He can get a better deal by counter-offering."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9200. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer of $9,200 is still higher than Bob's ideal price.  While it's a slight decrease from her initial offer, Bob still has room to negotiate further. He's better off making another counter-offer to see if he can get closer to his desired price."

{""message"": ""I appreciate you being willing to compromise, Alice. However, $9,200 is still a little high for me.  How about $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to drop the price to $9100, which is still a great value for the product. I think it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is continuing to lower her price, $9,100 is still above Bob's ideal price.  He's still willing to negotiate further to try to get a better deal.  There's a good chance Alice might be willing to come down a bit more to secure the sale, so it's worth trying one more counter-offer."
