"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point.  You have no information on the product's value to Alice, so there's a possibility she'd accept a lower price.  It's best to see if you can negotiate a better deal before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This price is a substantial discount from her initial offer and will hopefully push her to consider a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down in price, it's still above my target. It's worth exploring if we can get closer to my initial counteroffer. I'm not in a rush and want to see if I can squeeze out a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,100,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still believe a lower price is possible. It also gives her a clearer idea of where I'm willing to settle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and I believe there's room for a price closer to my target.  I'm still committed to getting a better deal and will continue to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my counteroffer again to $1,150,000.  We're getting closer to a compromise, and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate.  This offer should help us bridge the gap and hopefully secure a deal within our remaining rounds."
