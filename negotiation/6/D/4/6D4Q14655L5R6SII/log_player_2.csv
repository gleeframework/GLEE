Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,800,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go that high. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his desired price, he can likely still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  He is still within his budget and has several rounds to go."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,400,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,400,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,550,000. This is a fair price that still leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but  $1,550,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go a little higher, but I'm sticking with $1,450,000. This is a fair price that considers your needs and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
