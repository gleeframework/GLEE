"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $15,000 is fair. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $12,000.  This is a very fair offer considering the product's potential.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $12,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, maybe around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the back and forth.  I want to find a solution that works for us, but $7,500 is still too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
