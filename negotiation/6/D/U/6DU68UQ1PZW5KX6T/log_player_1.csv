Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $15,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is too low.  I need to negotiate but selling to John is a good alternative if the negotiation fails.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $12,000.  This is a very fair offer considering the product's potential."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $12,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, maybe around $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still too far from my minimum. I'll counter-offer, but start considering John if Bob doesn't budge significantly.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the back and forth.  I want to find a solution that works for us, but $7,500 is still too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 10500}
