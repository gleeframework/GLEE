Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $170. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering it at $170 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate the price down, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you insight into his level of interest and potential for negotiation."
