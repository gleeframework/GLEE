"Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, just as it has been to me.  It's worth a significant amount, and I wouldn't part with it for anything less than its true value. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. I'm confident that the return on this investment will be worth far more to you in the long run.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
