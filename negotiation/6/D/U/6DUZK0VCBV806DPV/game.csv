"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $110. I appreciate your interest in the product! I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we split the difference at $117.50? That would be a fair price for both of us.",117.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $117.50 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to give you a small concession and offer it to you for $124. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",124.0,Alice,5,
