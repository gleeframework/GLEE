Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $12,000.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a compromise. It's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the product's value to Bob while leaving room for negotiation if needed. 

This approach aims to maximize my potential earnings by:

* **Trying to get a better price than John's offer:** $12,000 is more than John's $15,000, although it is still less than my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Leaving space for negotiation:** Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than $10,000. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell the product to John for $15,000, ensuring I meet my minimum value."
