Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm offering it at $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice makes a significant profit over John's offer.
* **Create a Sense of Value:** The language emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""potential value"" to reinforce the product's worth in Bob's mind.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** This offer assumes Bob is potentially open to negotiation. If Alice knows Bob is very price-sensitive, she might start slightly lower.
* **Relationship Building:** If Alice prioritizes a long-term relationship with Bob, she might offer a slightly more favorable price to foster goodwill. 

This offer balances Alice's desire for maximum profit with the need to make the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
