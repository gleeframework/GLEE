"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that's worth a lot to you! I'm willing to let it go for a price that's definitely fair for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $120 is less than $150.
* **You can still save money:**  Even though you're paying more than the product's worth to Alice ($80), you're still saving $30 compared to buying from John."
