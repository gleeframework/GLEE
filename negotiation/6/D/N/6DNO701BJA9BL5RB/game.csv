"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but the product's value is significantly higher than what you're proposing.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This is a very competitive price for what you're getting.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference at $925,000? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. While $925,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product. Would you consider $975,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
