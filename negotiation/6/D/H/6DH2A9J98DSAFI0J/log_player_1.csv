Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

This offer attempts to maximize my profit while still being potentially attractive to Bob. Here's why:

* **Above My Minimum:** The offer is above my minimum price of $80, making it potentially profitable for me. 
* **Not Too High:**  $90 is a reasonable starting point. It's not excessively high, which might make Bob immediately reject it.  

If Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $80, ensuring I still make a profit."
