Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $15,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing above my minimum price.
* **Confident Presentation:**  The wording implies the product's value while offering a seemingly attractive price, encouraging Bob to consider it seriously. 

Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, there's a chance to negotiate before moving on to John."
