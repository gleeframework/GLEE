Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $100 initially gives us room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Politeness:**  Starting with a friendly message helps build rapport. 
* **Value Proposition:**  Mentioning the product being ""fantastic"" subtly hints at its value without revealing our minimum. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, we've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, we'll analyze his counteroffer and decide our next move, keeping in mind our minimum of $80 and the potential sale to John."
