``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. This gives me the opportunity to potentially get closer to my desired price while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $800,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $800,000 to you. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $850,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further but I won't accept anything below $900,000. I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still not quite there for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a good deal for both of us, as it's within your budget and closer to my desired price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts in trying to reach an agreement. Considering the value of the product to me, I am willing to offer $860,000. I hope this proposal is acceptable and we can move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's clear that Bob is unwilling to go much higher, and I'm not willing to drop below $875,000.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John. I'm still getting a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with John by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
