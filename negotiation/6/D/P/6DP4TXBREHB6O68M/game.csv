"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $800,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $800,000 to you. Let's try to find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still not quite there for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a good deal for both of us, as it's within your budget and closer to my desired price.  What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
