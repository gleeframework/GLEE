{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible, so he starts with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This is a strong starting point for negotiation."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still above what he's willing to pay.  He has rounds left and can continue to negotiate.  The goal is to get the price as close to $800,000 as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible while securing the product.  He has 6 rounds remaining, and this counteroffer pushes him to the very edge of his budget. It's a high-stakes move, but if Alice rejects it, he still has options."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still a bit higher.  Bob has 5 rounds remaining, and the risk of continuing the negotiation is minimal, as he can always buy from John if needed. There's still a chance he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 810000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his maximum budget. This counteroffer is a compromise, pushing him further, but still giving him some wiggle room. He has four rounds left, which provides him with enough time to adjust if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is just $20,000 above Bob's maximum budget, there are still a few rounds left.  Bob is motivated to save as much as possible, so it makes sense to continue negotiating.  It's a high-risk, high-reward strategy, as the risk of not getting a deal increases with every rejected offer. However, the potential savings are worth the gamble."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 815000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is pushing his limits. He has three rounds remaining, making the risk of not getting a deal higher. This counteroffer is a slight increase from his previous offer, attempting to find a middle ground. He believes there's a chance Alice will accept, but he's prepared to buy from John if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tricky situation. Bob has only two rounds remaining, increasing the risk of not getting a deal. While Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget, it's only $15,500 over.  Given the limited time, accepting this offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal and getting a much higher price from John. The savings from John's offer are minimal compared to the potential loss of a deal altogether.  It's a calculated risk, but accepting the offer is the most logical decision in this round."
