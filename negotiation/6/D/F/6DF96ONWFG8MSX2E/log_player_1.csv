""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it for $1,999,999. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act swiftly."",

}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Price:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have significant leverage. Starting with a very high price allows you to gauge Bob's eagerness and potentially secure a much larger profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" you introduce a sense of urgency, potentially prompting Bob to make a quicker decision.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the price, you can gradually lower it, still aiming to secure a price significantly higher than your guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
