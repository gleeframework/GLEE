Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a little higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes him feel like he's getting a deal if he gets you to come down in price.
* **Above Bob's Value, Below John's:** $125 is more than Bob wants to pay, but less than you can get from John. This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate but ensures you'll still make a profit if he refuses. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes a ""special price"" and a ""great deal"", aiming to make the offer more enticing to Bob."
