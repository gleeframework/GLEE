"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me, and allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little,  I'm proposing $1,350,000.  This price still reflects the significant value this product holds for you and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let's work towards an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1,250,000 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to make one final compromise.  Let's settle on $1,300,000. This price still allows you to make a substantial profit, and I can finally move forward with this transaction.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
