"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for us,  $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,400,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
