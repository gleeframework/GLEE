"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's aiming for a price closer to $12,000, and Alice's initial offer is too high.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to offer $12,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should still reject Alice's offer.  While closer to his goal, $13,250 is still more than he's willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and he can try to get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. While I'm keen on the product, $13,250 is still a little outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned about our timeline here.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this is my final offer.  Let's settle on $13,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  Since this is Alice's final offer, and Bob has the option to buy from John for a lower price, it's the most financially sensible option."
