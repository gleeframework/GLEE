Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to offer $12,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I want to see if I can push him a bit higher."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. While I'm keen on the product, $13,250 is still a little outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm starting to run out of time, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll see if I can push him a little further before selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
