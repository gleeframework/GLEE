"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to offer $12,500.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. While I'm keen on the product, $13,250 is still a little outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",12750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned about our timeline here.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this is my final offer.  Let's settle on $13,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",13000.0,Alice,5,
