"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $175.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $150 to her, so it's likely worth at least that much to me. I can buy it from John for the same price, so I'll pass on Alice's offer.
