Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still committed to your offer of $12000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13500. This is my final compromise, and I hope you can meet me at this price.

Bob should buy the product from John. 

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is the closest she's come to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget of $12,000.  Since he has the option to buy from John at his desired price, it's the most financially sensible choice to avoid any further negotiation and secure the product at the best possible price."
