I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation. It's also a good idea to start high to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping that this price will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, while still allowing me to get a reasonable amount for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob has shown he's not willing to budge from his price.  I've already made a compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  Since John is offering my minimum price, I'll sell to him to avoid further negotiation."
