Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $11,500? I think it's a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $11,250? I think this is a fair price that takes into account your concerns and still reflects the value of the product.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While it's not his ideal price, it's a fair compromise and significantly lower than John's price. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal with Alice and having to settle for John's higher price."
