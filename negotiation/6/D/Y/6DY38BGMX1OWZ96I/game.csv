"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a product that is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
