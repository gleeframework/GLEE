"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by its previous owners. Given its quality and features, it's worth significantly more than its manufacturing cost. Considering its value and the effort put into it, I'm offering it to you for $120. This price reflects the balance between the product's worth and my desire to ensure you receive a great deal. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While Alice's message is tempting, $120 is still significantly more than your $80 limit and what John offers.  You'll get the best deal by going with John."
