Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is the lowest I can accept.  I will analyze the situation and make a decision.
