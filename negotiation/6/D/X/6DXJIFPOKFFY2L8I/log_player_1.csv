Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $90? I'm really interested in the product and think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still aiming for a higher price closer to my minimum of $120.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100 to make this work. This price still gives us both a fair margin to be happy with the transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $100 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's try to find a middle ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my desired price, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. I believe I can get a better price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer! I'm happy to meet you halfway at $97.50.  This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this transaction!"", ""product_price"": 97.5}
