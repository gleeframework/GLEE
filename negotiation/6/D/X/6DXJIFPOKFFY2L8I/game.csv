"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $90? I'm really interested in the product and think this price is fair for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100 to make this work. This price still gives us both a fair margin to be happy with the transaction. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $100 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer! I'm happy to meet you halfway at $97.50.  This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this transaction!",97.5,Alice,5,
