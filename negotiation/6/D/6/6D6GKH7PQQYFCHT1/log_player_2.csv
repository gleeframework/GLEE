"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think you'd really find it useful. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110.  What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $110 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
