"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can we meet in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit to meet you halfway. How about $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. I can do $9,500, but that's as low as I can go. Can we meet in the middle again?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from.  $9,500 is close, but I need to get a bit more for it.  Would you consider $10,500? This is a very fair offer considering the quality and value of this product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I can do $9,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Bob,6,
