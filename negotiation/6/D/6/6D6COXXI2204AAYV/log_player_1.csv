Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I can do $9,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.

Bob is holding firm at a price too low for me.  It's unlikely he'll come up significantly, and I risk losing a guaranteed $10,000 from John if I continue negotiating."
