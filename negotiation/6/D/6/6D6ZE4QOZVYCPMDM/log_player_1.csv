"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum of $80.  This gives me some room to negotiate and still potentially make a good profit. I've also emphasized the value the product holds for Bob, hoping to encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $100?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than $80 from John, I think I can still get closer to my ideal price of $120. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $110.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for my product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a fair price, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $105? That's a good price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price of $110. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
