"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss this opportunity with you. I value this product at a minimum of $1,200,000, but to get the ball rolling, I'm willing to offer it to you at $1,800,000. I believe it's a fair starting point considering the value it brings.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product is valuable, but  $1,800,000 is not within my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers? That would be $1,275,000. It's a fair deal that recognizes the value of this product.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
