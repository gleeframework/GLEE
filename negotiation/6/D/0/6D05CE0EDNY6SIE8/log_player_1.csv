This counteroffer shows flexibility while still pushing for a higher price. It's a compromise that acknowledges Bob's offer but maintains my position of wanting more than $1,400,000."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price and potentially leaves too much on the table. I believe there is room for more negotiation. I'm willing to risk another round, hoping to find a more agreeable compromise."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum. While I would prefer a higher price, I'm willing to accept this offer to secure the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation. There's a good chance Bob won't budge further, and risking another round could lead to me having to sell to John for a significantly lower price."
