"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway and going down to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $950,000 is a fair price, I'm aiming for a slightly higher return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a revised offer of $925,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value while staying within my means. Can you consider this revised offer?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above the $1 million mark. My final offer is $1,000,000 even. This is a significant discount from my initial asking price and reflects my desire to see this product in the hands of someone who appreciates its value. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down further, but I'm still not comfortable going above $900,000. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $900,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options, including purchasing from John for $800,000.",900000.0,Bob,6,
