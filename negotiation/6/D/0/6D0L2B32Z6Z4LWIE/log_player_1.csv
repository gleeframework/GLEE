**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $900,000 and even threatening to go to a competitor (John) which doesn't make sense in this scenario as we know the product is only worth $800,000 to him. This indicates Bob is unlikely to budge significantly from his position.  

Accepting Bob's offer would mean a $300,000 loss compared to selling to John. It's time to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
