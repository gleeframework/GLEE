"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get out of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,100,000 is a tempting offer, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair return on this unique product. I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's aim for a quick resolution that benefits us both.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, I'm still a bit higher than where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a price that allows me to recoup my investment.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
