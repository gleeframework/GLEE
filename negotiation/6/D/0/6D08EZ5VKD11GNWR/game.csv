"I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $9,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $10,250. It's a fair price, given the value of the product. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,250, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me there?",9800.0,Bob,4,
