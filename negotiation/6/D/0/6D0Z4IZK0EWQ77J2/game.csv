"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. The product's value is significantly higher, and I'm confident you'll agree. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This is a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,750. Can you consider that?",9750.0,Bob,4,
