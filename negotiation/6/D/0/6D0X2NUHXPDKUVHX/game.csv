"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but the $1,400,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer takes into account the potential benefits you'll reap from owning it.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the product's unique features and potential ROI make it a steal even at $1,900,000. Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is my final offer.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
