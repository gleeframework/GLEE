"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This price still allows me to make a profit and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product to you.",10000.0,Alice,3,
