"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more equitable price. Would you consider selling the product to me for $800000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a bit more to justify the sale. How about $850000? This would still be a great value for you, and allows me to get closer to what I need. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your position, and I am willing to increase my offer to $820000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me.",820000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $820000 is still a bit below what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  Would you consider $840000? It's a good middle ground that allows us both to make a fair deal. ",840000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While we're getting closer,  $830000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down to $835000. This is a fair compromise for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. Let's make this happen.",835000.0,Alice,7,
