"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",90.0,Alice,3,

I appreciate you working with me Alice. How about $75? That's a fair bit closer to your price.,75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $105? It's still a good deal for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
