"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $8000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10000. Is this a price you'd be willing to pay? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's counteroffer of $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to reject her offer and make another counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but still within my budget.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still a bit short on budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me at this price.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is still too high for me. I'd like to reject her offer and consider buying the product from John for $8,000 instead.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I think there's been a mistake. I chose to reject Alice's offer and consider buying the product from John for $8,000, not to make a counteroffer. Since I've already decided to buy from John, I'll stop negotiating with Alice.

However, I can still make a counteroffer to Alice as a last resort. Since I've already rejected her previous offer, I'll make a counteroffer that's even lower than my previous one.
