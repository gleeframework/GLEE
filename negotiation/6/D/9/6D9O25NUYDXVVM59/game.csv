"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher to me than $1,200,000.  I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000.  This is a very competitive price for what you're getting.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
