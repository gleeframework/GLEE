"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what Bob is willing to pay. While it's a good starting point, there's room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of your product,  $1,350,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,225,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price point. He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  Bob should aim for a price closer to his maximum budget of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your product's value, but $1,225,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,187,500. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,187,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,187,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. While it's a better price than her initial offer, it's not worth risking a further negotiation that might end with a higher price or a stalemate. It's more beneficial for Bob to purchase the product from John at his fixed price of $1,000,000. This guarantees the lowest possible price and avoids the potential for further negotiation complications."
