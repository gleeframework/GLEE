"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start low:**  Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to leave room for bargaining later.
* **Be reasonable:**  $11,000 is still a decent price for Alice, considering her product value is $10,000. 
* **Be polite:**  A friendly message keeps the negotiation open and avoids sounding too aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than John's price, Bob can still try to negotiate lower. Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer allows Bob to continue exploring a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is a fair price, considering what you're getting and what I'm willing to pay. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
