"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it could really benefit you.  I'm asking for $18,000 to start the conversation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is far too high.  It's more than double your maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $18,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However,  $8,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  To be fair, I could come down to $15,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the true worth of what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from $18,000, $15,000 is still above my budget. It's worth trying to push for a lower price, especially since I can always buy from John for $8,000 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $15,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,500?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my budget, $12,500 is still too high.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before potentially buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is still above my budget.  I'm firm on $10,000.  If you can't meet me there, I'll have to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
