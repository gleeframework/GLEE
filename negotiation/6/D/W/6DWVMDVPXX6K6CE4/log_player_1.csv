"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it could really benefit you.  I'm asking for $18,000 to start the conversation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiations often benefit from starting with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for concessions and can give the impression of the product's high value.
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer is more about understanding Bob's interest level and flexibility. His response will help determine the next move. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a safety net. Alice doesn't need to feel pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $18,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is far below Alice's minimum price of $12,000. Accepting would mean a significant loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a large gap between the initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, suggesting there's room for negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has the security of John's offer, allowing her to confidently negotiate for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However,  $8,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  To be fair, I could come down to $15,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the true worth of what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 15000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession:**  Alice makes a substantial decrease from her initial offer, signaling to Bob that she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Justification:**  By stating the offer is ""fair"" and reflects the product's ""true worth,"" Alice reinforces the value proposition.
* **Leaving Room:**  While the new offer is closer to her minimum, Alice leaves room for further negotiation if Bob counters again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $15,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider my other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer has increased, $10,000 is still less than Alice's minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Testing the ""Absolute Limit"":**  Bob is using a common negotiation tactic by stating an ""absolute limit.""  Alice needs to determine if he's truly firm or if there's more flexibility.
* **John as Leverage:**  Alice's safety net of selling to John for $12,000 means she can apply a bit more pressure on Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,500?  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 12500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  Alice holds her ground above her $12,000 minimum while demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **""Splitting the Difference"":** This common tactic can feel agreeable to both parties and suggests a sense of fairness.
* **Finality:** By stating this is her ""final offer,"" Alice creates a sense of urgency and emphasizes that she's reached her limit. 
* **Time Consideration:**  With rounds progressing, Alice needs to move Bob closer to a decision to avoid running out of time and potentially losing John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is still above my budget.  I'm firm on $10,000.  If you can't meet me there, I'll have to look at other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is Firm:** Bob has now repeated his ""absolute limit"" of $10,000 multiple times.  It's highly likely this is his final offer, and he's unlikely to budge. 
* **Losing Valuable Time:** Continuing negotiations with Bob risks losing John's guaranteed offer of $12,000. Rounds are progressing, and there's no guarantee Bob will increase his offer.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John provides a certain outcome at Alice's minimum acceptable price. It's the most rational decision to maximize profit and minimize risk at this point."
