"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it could really benefit you.  I'm asking for $18,000 to start the conversation. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $18,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However,  $8,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  To be fair, I could come down to $15,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the true worth of what you're getting.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $15,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider my other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,500?  This is my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is still above my budget.  I'm firm on $10,000.  If you can't meet me there, I'll have to look at other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
