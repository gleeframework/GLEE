"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $115 for it. What do you think?",115.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $115 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
