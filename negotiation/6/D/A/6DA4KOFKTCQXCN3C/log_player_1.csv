Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could be a game-changer for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,450,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting high leaves room for negotiation and signals the product's value to Alice.
* **Close to Alice's minimum:** The price is very close to Alice's minimum acceptable price, ensuring she still gets a significant return.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value, Alice subtly justifies the high price without revealing her bottom line.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The offer doesn't need to be the final price.  If Bob negotiates, Alice can slightly reduce the price while still staying above her $1,500,000 minimum.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than his perceived value while leaving Alice in a strong position to accept John's offer if Bob declines."
