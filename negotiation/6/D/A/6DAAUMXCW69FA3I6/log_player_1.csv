"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000, which is $1,000 above my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I have 9 more rounds to try and get a better deal with Bob, so I'm not going to settle for less than what I'm comfortable with just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  That's a fair price for both of us and allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $7,800. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $7,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I still have a few rounds left to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  Selling to John for $8,000 is a safe option, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $8,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I would be happy to finalize the deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8000}
