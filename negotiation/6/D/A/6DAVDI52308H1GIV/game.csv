"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which still gives you a good deal while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. Could you consider $9,750? It's the best I can do, but I really want to make this deal work.",9750.0,Bob,4,
