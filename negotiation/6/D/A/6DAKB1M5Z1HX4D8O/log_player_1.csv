I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good compromise:

* It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him a good deal.
* It's lower than my guaranteed price from John, ensuring I still make a profit. 

This strategy increases the likelihood of Bob accepting, while still maximizing my potential earnings."
