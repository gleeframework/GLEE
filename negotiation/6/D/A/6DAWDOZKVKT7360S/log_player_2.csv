"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product. Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is above your limit. While you can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John, you will still be paying a significant amount for the product.  The best strategy is to reject Alice's offer and buy from John for a much lower price."
