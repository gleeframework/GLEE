"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's lower than John's price, it's still above the product's value to Bob ($12,000). 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm confident the product is worth $13,000 to me.  I'm happy to pay that, let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
