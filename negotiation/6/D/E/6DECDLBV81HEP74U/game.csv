"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $750000 for your product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the product's value and the potential benefits it offers, I'm willing to come down to $900000. This price is still a fair reflection of the product's worth, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in this compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900000 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming to get the best possible deal. I'm willing to go up to $800000 for the product. This price reflects a significant saving for me while still acknowledging the product's value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
