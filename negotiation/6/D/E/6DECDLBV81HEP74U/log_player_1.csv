Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at the maximum price knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This allows me to potentially secure a higher price than John's offer.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and emphasizing fairness to encourage Bob to engage in negotiations. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By mentioning ""let me know your thoughts"" I'm implicitly acknowledging the possibility of counteroffers.

This initial offer sets the stage for a potential negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter based on his offer and the need to keep John's $1,000,000 offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $750000 for your product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $750,000 is still a significant amount, it's significantly lower than the product's value to me ($1,000,000) and even lower than John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a more favorable deal.
* **Backup Plan:**  John's offer is still available, providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail. 

I'll proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the product's value and the potential benefits it offers, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price is still a fair reflection of the product's worth, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in this compromise."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with Justification:** I'm not simply rejecting Bob's offer, but providing a counteroffer with a clear reason behind it.  I'm acknowledging the product's value and positioning my offer as a compromise.
* **Strategic Reduction:**  The $900,000 price is closer to Bob's offer, indicating flexibility, but still above John's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate while maintaining a strong position.
* **Re-emphasize Win-Win:**  The ""win-win"" phrase reiterates the idea of a mutually beneficial deal, appealing to Bob's rationality. 

By making this counteroffer, I'm hoping to strike a deal that's more favorable than John's offer, while still leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900000 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming to get the best possible deal. I'm willing to go up to $800000 for the product. This price reflects a significant saving for me while still acknowledging the product's value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is only $200,000 away from my desired price of $1,000,000. This is a significant improvement from his initial offer of $750,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could potentially negotiate further, there's a chance that Bob might walk away or become less willing to negotiate. Accepting his offer secures a good deal and avoids the uncertainty of further rounds.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $1,000,000 is appealing, accepting Bob's offer would still result in a large profit and saves me the effort of further negotiation.

Considering the risk of further negotiation and the high potential profit, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most logical decision at this point."
