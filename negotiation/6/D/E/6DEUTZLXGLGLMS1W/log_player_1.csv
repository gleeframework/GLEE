Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

Even though Bob's offer is now above John's standing offer, we still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a much better deal.  We're getting closer to a reasonable price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1,200,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

It seems Bob is firm on his valuation around $1,050,000. Accepting this offer is better than John's $1,000,000 and further haggling might not yield a significantly better result.  It's time to close the deal."
