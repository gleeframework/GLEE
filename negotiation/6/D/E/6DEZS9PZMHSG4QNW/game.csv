"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe we can find a price closer to my valuation of the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This price still leaves plenty of room for you to profit, and it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
