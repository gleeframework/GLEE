"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value item. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum budget and John's offer.  It's highly likely you can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way outside my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $9,000 for it to make sense for me."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:**  This offer is intentionally low. It establishes a strong starting point for negotiation and signals that I'm serious about getting a good price. 
* **Leaving Room:** Offering $9,000 leaves plenty of room for negotiation before reaching my $10,000 maximum.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is respectful but clearly communicates my budgetary limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $12,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $12,000 is a significant improvement, it's still above both my budget and John's offer. There's room for further negotiation. Alice is clearly willing to come down in price, so I'll continue to counter-offer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm getting closer, but $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  That's the highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counter-offer splits the difference between her previous offer ($12,000) and my previous offer ($9,000). It shows willingness to compromise while moving closer to a deal.
* **Anchoring:** By stating $10,500 is the ""highest I can go,"" I'm setting a firm but slightly flexible anchor. It suggests this is my final offer, but there might be a tiny bit of wiggle room if she's truly motivated to sell.
* **Urgency:** We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation.  Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Alice to make a more significant concession in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit far from my target. I can do $13,000, which is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We're reaching a stalemate. Alice has come down to $13,000, and I've signaled my maximum is $10,500. There's a risk she won't budge much further. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's standing offer of $10,000 is looking increasingly attractive. By rejecting, I put pressure on Alice while keeping my fallback option open.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll send a final offer closer to John's price.  This either motivates Alice to make a deal or pushes me to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but to be honest,  $13,000 is more than I'm willing to spend.  I can offer you $10,250 as my absolute final offer.  I need to make a decision soon, otherwise, I'll have to go with another option I've been considering."",
""product_price"": 10250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This offer is just slightly above John's price, signaling strong interest but limited flexibility.
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning a ""final offer"" and an ""alternative option,"" I create urgency for Alice to make a decision.
* **Walk-Away Price:**  I'm mentally prepared to walk away at this point if Alice rejects the offer. The difference between $10,250 and $10,000 isn't substantial enough to continue prolonged negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're running out of time, but I'm not willing to go below $14,000. It's the lowest price I can accept, and I'm starting to think it's worth waiting for a better offer. I'm willing to give you a bit more time to think about it, but I need to be clear that $14,000 is my final counteroffer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Deadlock:** Alice is firm at $14,000, and I'm unwilling to go above $10,250.  Further negotiation is unlikely to close this gap.
* **Saving Money:** John's offer of $10,000 is significantly better than Alice's final price. By choosing John, I save a considerable amount.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only a few rounds left, continuing to negotiate with Alice has a low probability of success and risks missing out on John's offer."
