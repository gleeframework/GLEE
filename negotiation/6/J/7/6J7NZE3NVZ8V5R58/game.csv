"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way outside my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $9,000 for it to make sense for me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $12,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm getting closer, but $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  That's the highest I can go.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit far from my target. I can do $13,000, which is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but to be honest,  $13,000 is more than I'm willing to spend.  I can offer you $10,250 as my absolute final offer.  I need to make a decision soon, otherwise, I'll have to go with another option I've been considering.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're running out of time, but I'm not willing to go below $14,000. It's the lowest price I can accept, and I'm starting to think it's worth waiting for a better offer. I'm willing to give you a bit more time to think about it, but I need to be clear that $14,000 is my final counteroffer. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,7,
