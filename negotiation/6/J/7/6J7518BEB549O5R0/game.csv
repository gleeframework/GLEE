"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  To be honest, $875,000 is still a little higher than I'd like to go.  How about we try $750,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is still significantly below the product's true value. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $825,000? This would be my final offer.",825000.0,Alice,5,
