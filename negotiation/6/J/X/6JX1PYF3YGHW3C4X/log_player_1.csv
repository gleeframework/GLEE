"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while still being above my minimum acceptable price.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm taking a calculated risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $8,000 is far too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's offer. I'm hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000.  I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  I think this might be a good compromise point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky one!  I have three options here:

1. **Accept Bob's Offer:** This is the most logical choice right now. It's my minimum acceptable price, and I've already had to make some compromises. 
2. **Reject Bob's Offer and Counteroffer:** This is risky. If Bob is firm on $10,000, I could end up with nothing if we can't agree.
3. **Sell to John:**  This is also tempting, as it's guaranteed money.  However, I might be able to get a slightly better deal with Bob.

Given the limited rounds and the fact that Bob's offer is my minimum, it's best to **accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $10,000**. I'm happy to secure the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
