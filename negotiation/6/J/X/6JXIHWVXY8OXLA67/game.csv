"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This would still be a great value for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
