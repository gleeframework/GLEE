"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high to leave room for compromise and maximize potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a more reasonable price. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $1400000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a significant sum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 8 rounds left and can still potentially get a better price from Bob or sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I understand your position and I am willing to meet you halfway. I would like to propose a price of $1550000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, it's likely that further negotiation will be difficult and time-consuming.  Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or a deal with John, which would yield the same amount."
