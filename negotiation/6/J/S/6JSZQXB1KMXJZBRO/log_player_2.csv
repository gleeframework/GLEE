"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price of $1,700,000. It's a significant investment, but one that I believe will yield substantial returns for you.  While I have a backup offer for $1,500,000, I'm confident that this product's worth to you justifies this slightly higher price. Consider this a chance to secure a valuable asset before it's gone. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.
