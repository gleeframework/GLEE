"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm really interested in the product though, and I'd be happy to pay $85 for it.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? This is my final offer, as I'm happy to buy from John for $80 if it doesn't work out.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though. I'll sell the product to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,5,
