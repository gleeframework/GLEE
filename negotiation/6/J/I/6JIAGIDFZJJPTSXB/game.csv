"I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm really interested in the product, though, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,500. It's a fair price that I think we can both be comfortable with. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
