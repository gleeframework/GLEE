"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a reasonable price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $14,000 is far above his budget of $8,000. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm really interested in the product, though, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,500. It's a fair price that I think we can both be comfortable with. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer.  $11,500 is still above his budget and he can always buy from John for $8,000.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  How about $10,000? This would give you a good profit and still be within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $10,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $11,000? It's a good compromise that I think we can both live with. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he's still better off continuing to negotiate or buying from John. There are still rounds remaining, and there's a chance Alice might lower her price even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. To make this work, I'd need to be at $10,500. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $11,250? It's a good compromise that I think we can both live with. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  He's now in the 7th round of negotiations with Alice, and while $11,250 is closer to his goal, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  At this point, it's not likely that Alice will come down significantly enough to make it worth continuing the negotiations. It's better to lock in the $8,000 price with John and move on."
