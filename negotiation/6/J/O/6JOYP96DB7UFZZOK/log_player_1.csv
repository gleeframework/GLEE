"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value but leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:**  A $950,000 price gets me closer to the $1,000,000 value Bob sees. 
* **Encourage negotiation:** It's unlikely Bob will accept this immediately, setting up a back-and-forth that allows us both to find a mutually agreeable price. 

I'm aware that if Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000.  This gives me a safety net and allows me to be more aggressive in my initial bid."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a significant amount, it's still lower than my desired price.  I'm rejecting Bob's offer and proceeding to the next round. 

* **Reasoning:** 
    * **Room for improvement:**  I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob.
    * **Negotiation leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not desperate and am willing to walk away. This strengthens my position in future rounds.
    * **Avoiding John's offer:**  While John's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for $800,000 if I believe there's a chance to get more. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll need to carefully consider my next counteroffer to Bob. I'll aim for a price that is higher than $850,000, but not so high that it completely discourages Bob from further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

My counteroffer of $900,000 represents a compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  It's $50,000 above Bob's current offer, showing I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Lower than my initial offer:** It's a decrease from my initial $950,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still above my minimum:**  $900,000 is significantly higher than my fallback price of $800,000 from John, so I'm not risking much by continuing. 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:** Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable price and we can reach an agreement.
* **Keep the momentum going:** Continuing the negotiation prevents Bob from walking away.

I'm cautiously optimistic that this counteroffer will lead to a successful deal, but I'm prepared to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still rejecting it and moving to the next round.

* **Reasoning:**
    * **Room for improvement:**  $875,000 is still $125,000 less than the value I believe the product holds for Bob. There's potential to push for a higher price.
    * **Negotiation leverage:**  By rejecting again, I maintain a strong bargaining position.
    * **Avoiding John's offer:**  I'm unwilling to settle for $800,000 when I'm confident I can get more from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to craft a counteroffer that is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  Aiming for something in the $885,000 - $900,000 range.
* **Convincing:**  I need to show Bob the value of the product and demonstrate the potential of a successful collaboration.

I'm committed to securing the best possible price for the product, and I'm prepared to stay in the negotiation as long as I believe there's room for a more favorable outcome."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 885000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $885,000. This is my reasoning:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** It's $10,000 higher than Bob's last offer, showing I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Lower than my previous offer:**  It's a slight decrease from my last counteroffer of $900,000, showcasing flexibility.
* **Still above my minimum:**  $885,000 is well above my fallback price of $800,000 from John, making this a safe move.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show commitment:** By continuing to make counteroffers, I'm demonstrating my interest in reaching an agreement with Bob.
* **Close the gap:** This offer brings us closer to a possible deal, encouraging Bob to reconsider his position.

I'm cautiously optimistic about this offer, but I'm prepared to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $880,000. Here's why:

* **Closing the gap:**  Bob has come up to $880,000, which is only $5,000 less than my last counteroffer. This shows he's serious about reaching a deal.
* **Time is ticking:** We're nearing the halfway point in our negotiations, and I don't want to risk losing a potential deal by being too stubborn.
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, $880,000 is still a significant profit and far better than selling to John for $800,000.

This decision balances my desire for a higher price with the need to be realistic and secure a deal before time runs out."
