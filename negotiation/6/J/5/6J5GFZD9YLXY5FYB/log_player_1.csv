Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Initial Price:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob. 
* **Aiming Above Bob's Value:**  Offering it at $19,000 aims to capture some of the perceived value for Bob while leaving room for potential negotiation. 
* **Confident Messaging:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start even higher to allow more bargaining room.
* **Relationship Dynamics:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might adjust your starting price slightly lower. However, remember your primary goal is maximizing your profit."
