"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm happy to start the negotiations at $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's starting offer is way above both your maximum price and the product's actual worth to her. There's plenty of room for negotiation. You know you can get it for $10,000 from John, so there's no need to rush into accepting a bad deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiations often involve starting lower than your intended price. This gives you room to bargain upwards. 
* **Not Too Low:** While starting low, you don't want to insult Alice with an extremely low offer. $11,000 is a reasonable counter that still leaves you significant savings potential.
* **Gauge Reaction:** This counteroffer helps gauge Alice's flexibility. Her response will tell you how much she's willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents a fair price for its value, I understand your perspective.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down a bit, but $15,500 is still significantly higher than what you're willing to pay and what John offers. It's clear there's more negotiating to be done. You have time to counter-offer and try to meet closer to a price that works for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. $15,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm serious about buying this product, but I'd need it to be closer to $12,000 to make it work. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Seriousness:** By acknowledging Alice's movement and reiterating your interest, you demonstrate a desire to find a deal.
* **Significant Jump:** Moving from $11,000 to $12,000 is a more substantial concession, signaling you're willing to be flexible if she reciprocates.
* **Still Room to Negotiate:** This leaves room to potentially meet in the middle if Alice is truly motivated to sell. Your backup plan of John's $10,000 offer keeps you in a strong position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer and for being upfront. I'm motivated to sell, but $12,000 is too low. How about we split the difference again and land at $13,750? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, which is good, but we're still a ways off from a price you're happy with. While she calls $13,750 a ""fair compromise"", it's important to remember you have a much better alternative with John.  Let's keep negotiating, but be prepared to walk away if the price doesn't come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm feeling like we're getting closer, but to be honest, $13,750 is still pushing my budget. I could potentially go up to $12,500, but that's really the best I can do. It's a fair offer considering the market value."",
""product_price"": 12500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Progress:** You want to maintain a positive tone and acknowledge that you're getting closer to a deal. 
* **Small Concession:**  A smaller counteroffer of $12,500 shows you're still negotiating but are getting closer to your limit. 
* **Justification:** Mentioning ""market value"" introduces an external factor and subtly suggests Alice's price might be inflated. 
* **Deadline Approaching:** You're now past the halfway point. This counteroffer puts some pressure on Alice while leaving you with room to negotiate a bit more if needed, or walk away and buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you've been great to negotiate with.  I understand your position on $12,500, but that's a difficult price point for me.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $15,000. To avoid going that route, I could accept no less than $14,000. This offer stands as my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has drawn a line in the sand. While she lowered her price to $14,000, her ""final offer"" and mention of another buyer at $15,000 signal she's unlikely to budge further.  

At this point, you've negotiated well and gotten her down significantly from her initial asking price. However, you know you have a guaranteed offer from John for $10,000. Accepting Alice's offer would mean overpaying by $4,000. It's time to walk away from the negotiation and take the guaranteed savings with John."
