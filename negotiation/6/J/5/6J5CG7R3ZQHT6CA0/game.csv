"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents a fair price for its value, I understand your perspective.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. $15,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm serious about buying this product, but I'd need it to be closer to $12,000 to make it work. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and for being upfront. I'm motivated to sell, but $12,000 is too low. How about we split the difference again and land at $13,750? This feels like a fair compromise.",13750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm feeling like we're getting closer, but to be honest, $13,750 is still pushing my budget. I could potentially go up to $12,500, but that's really the best I can do. It's a fair offer considering the market value.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you've been great to negotiate with.  I understand your position on $12,500, but that's a difficult price point for me.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $15,000. To avoid going that route, I could accept no less than $14,000. This offer stands as my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,7,
