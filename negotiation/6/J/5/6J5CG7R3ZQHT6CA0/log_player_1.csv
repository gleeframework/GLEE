Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm feeling like we're getting closer, but to be honest, $13,750 is still pushing my budget. I could potentially go up to $12,500, but that's really the best I can do. It's a fair offer considering the market value.
