"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000.  This is a bold move, but it establishes my initial value for the product and leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to hold out for a bit longer.  I believe there's still potential to get closer to my initial asking price. This rejection keeps the negotiation active and allows me to see if Bob is truly willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a price closer to my initial goal. This should test how serious Bob is about getting the product and whether he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We've gone through a few rounds and his counteroffer is getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $18,000,  accepting now ensures a higher price than selling to John and limits the risk of further negotiation failures."
