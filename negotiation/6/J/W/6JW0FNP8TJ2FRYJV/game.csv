"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal considering the value you'll get. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Let's make it $9,750 and close the deal? ",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer, but $9,750 still doesn't meet my needs.  I'm willing to go down to $10,250. That's a fair compromise considering the value this product offers.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",10250.0,Alice,5,
