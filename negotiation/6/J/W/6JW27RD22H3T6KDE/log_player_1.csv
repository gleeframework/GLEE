Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential benefits it can offer your business.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is still a significant amount and likely a better deal for you than selling it to John. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'll try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still leaves a considerable profit margin for you. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1200000 is still outside my budget. As I mentioned, I'm willing to pay $800000, which is a fair price considering John is also offering it to me for that amount.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It seems Bob is firm on his offer of $800,000.  I've already made a significant concession, and I'm not willing to go lower. Since John is offering me $1,500,000, it's more beneficial for me to sell to him."
