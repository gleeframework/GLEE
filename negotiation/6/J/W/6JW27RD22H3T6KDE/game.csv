"Alice, your offer is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is still a significant amount and likely a better deal for you than selling it to John. Let's see if we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which still leaves a considerable profit margin for you. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1200000 is still outside my budget. As I mentioned, I'm willing to pay $800000, which is a fair price considering John is also offering it to me for that amount.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
