{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so aiming for a price closer to that maximizes potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly above her minimum.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a safety net. Alice doesn't need to desperately lowball Bob."
