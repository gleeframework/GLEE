"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, $9,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a fair price that balances your budget with the product's value. What do you think?

Alice's offer:

I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go while still ensuring I meet my minimum value for the product. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to squeeze the last bit of savings out of the deal, Bob. However, I've already given you a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but no lower. This is the best I can do. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower.  While $11,250 is a better price than John's offer, continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better result. It's time to cut losses and buy from John to ensure you get the product."
