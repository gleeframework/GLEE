"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me, would you consider $8,000?"", 
""product_price"": 8000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? That's fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice met your target price:** Her offer of $10,000 is the maximum you're willing to pay.
* **John offers the same price:** Buying from John would also cost you $10,000.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely:** Alice is already making concessions by meeting your price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower."
