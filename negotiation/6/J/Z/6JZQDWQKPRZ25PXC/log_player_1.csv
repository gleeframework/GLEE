Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, which can make him more receptive. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond.

**Strategy:**

* I'll be willing to go down to around $10,000 before I consider selling to John. 
* If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I'll make counteroffers to nudge him closer to my desired price. 
* My goal is to secure a price that's as close to $12,000 as possible, but I'm flexible to avoid losing the sale entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price of $12,000.  
* **Potential for Negotiation:** I believe there's room for negotiation. Bob's message shows he's interested in the product, so there's a chance I can get him closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is the Last Resort:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is the best outcome, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a better price from Bob before resorting to that.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $10,000. I'll likely aim for $10,500, as I'm willing to come down a bit, but I want to maintain some leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $10,500 for the product.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that this is still a great deal for him, emphasizing the value he's getting.
* **Open Ended Question:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and keep the negotiation moving. 

**Strategy:**

* **Staying Firm but Flexible:**  I'm aiming for a price that's a bit closer to my desired price of $12,000. 
* **Avoiding a Stalemate:** By compromising, I'm reducing the risk of a stalemate where both of us reject offers.
* **Ready for a Final Counteroffer:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'm likely to stick to $10,500 or make a very small concession."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is essentially a meeting point between our last two offers. This shows a good faith effort on his part.
* **Close to My Minimum:** While not ideal, $10,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk he'll walk away completely, or we'll get stuck in a protracted negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

It's better to secure a sale at a slightly lower price than to risk losing the deal entirely. This offer is close enough to my minimum to make it worthwhile.  I'm confident I can find other buyers in the future, and this sale is a good opportunity to close a deal."
