"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $6,000. I understand that's a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I think that's a fair price for the product's value, and I'm willing to make a deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about $7,500? That's a reasonable price closer to your offer.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer of $7,500. I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low, but I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we try $10,000? I think that's the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again.",10000.0,Alice,5,
