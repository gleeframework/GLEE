Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant amount of money for me, but it still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is still a good amount of money, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $1,400,000. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer. I believe this is a fair price that still allows me to earn a significant amount of money, while also making it more likely for Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. 

While I would prefer to get a higher price, Bob's counteroffer is getting too low for my liking. It's clear that we are not going to agree on a price that works for both of us.  Selling to John guarantees me a solid return, and it's better to secure that than to keep negotiating and risk getting nothing at all."
