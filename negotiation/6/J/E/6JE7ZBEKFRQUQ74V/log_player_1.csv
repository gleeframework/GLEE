""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $10,000 allows some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still ensuring Alice gets a significant profit above her minimum.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** Offering it for the full $12,000 is risky as Bob might reject it outright. By offering a price that's beneficial to both parties, Alice increases the chances of a successful sale."
