"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still a significant markup from her own valuation of $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. This might prompt Alice to make a counter-offer closer to her valuation. 

Remember, your worst-case scenario is buying from John at $1,500,000. You have some space to negotiate before resorting to that option."
