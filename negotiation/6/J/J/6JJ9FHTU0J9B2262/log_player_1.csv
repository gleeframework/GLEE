**Reasoning:**

Bob is unwilling to budge beyond his perceived value of $1,200,000.  At this point, continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer. Accepting his offer would mean losing out on the potential profit. Selling to John ensures you receive the product's full value and avoids the risk of Bob not budging further."
