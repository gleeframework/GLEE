"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $135, which is a great deal!  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $135 is better than her initial value of $150, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of getting a better deal from Alice or simply buying it at your target price from John."
