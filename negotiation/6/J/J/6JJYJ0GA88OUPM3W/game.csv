"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $9000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $10500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $10250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for you.  What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not convinced that $10250 is the best price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to see a bit more flexibility. Can you consider $10000?",10000.0,Bob,6,
