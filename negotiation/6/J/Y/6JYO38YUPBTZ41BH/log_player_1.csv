"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $11,500, which is a bit more than halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value ($12,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  This price also leaves room for a few rounds of counteroffers without risking losing the deal to John.

**Strategy:**

I'll be watching Bob's response closely. If he rejects the offer, I'll adjust my counteroffers based on his willingness to negotiate. My goal is to get as close to his perceived value as possible within the 10 rounds. 

If the negotiations stall or become unfavorable, I'll always have the option of selling to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is low:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is only $500 above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe I can still get a better price, especially since I have 8 rounds left. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  While selling to John is an option, I'm not desperate to do so at this stage.

**Strategy:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground.  I'll continue to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate and adjust my offers accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $11,000, which is $500 less than my initial offer and $500 more than Bob's offer. 
* **Balanced approach:** This offer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm not giving in too quickly, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.

**Strategy:**

I'll observe Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he's willing to negotiate further, I'll adjust my offers accordingly. If he rejects again, I'll consider my options:

* **Counteroffer again:** If I believe there's room for further negotiation, I'll make another counteroffer, keeping in mind the remaining rounds and the risk of selling to John.
* **Sell to John:** If Bob seems unwilling to budge, I'll weigh the potential gains of continuing the negotiation against the risk of losing time and ultimately getting a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still low:** While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still quite a bit below my desired price and only $750 more than my minimum.
* **Potential for improvement:** With 6 rounds left, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can push Bob further towards my desired price.
* **John remains a safe option:** Selling to John is still a viable backup plan, but I'm not desperate to do so just yet.

**Strategy:**

I will make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my previous offer of $11,000. I'll carefully assess Bob's willingness to negotiate and adjust my offers accordingly. If his counteroffers remain low, I'll start considering selling to John as the negotiations progress."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm lowering my price to $10,900, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. This is only $150 away from Bob's latest offer, suggesting I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer is a test to see if Bob is truly willing to budge closer to my price point.  If he rejects again, it suggests he's more fixed on a lower price. 
* **Time is running out:** With 5 rounds left, I need to find a solution that works for both of us. 

**Strategy:**

I'll closely observe Bob's response to this offer.  If he accepts, I've secured a decent price. If he rejects, I'll assess the situation. If his counteroffers remain low, I'll start leaning towards selling to John in the remaining rounds to avoid a potentially drawn-out and ultimately unfavorable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's latest offer of $10,600 is only slightly better than his previous one and still significantly below my desired price. 
* **Negotiations stalling:** We've been going back and forth for a while, and it seems like Bob is not willing to budge significantly.
* **Time pressure:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of continuing negotiations and getting a lower price is high. 

**Strategy:**

Selling to John guarantees a safe $10,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price and a secure deal.  There's a high chance that continuing the negotiation will only lead to more back-and-forth with Bob, potentially ending with a lower price or no deal at all."
