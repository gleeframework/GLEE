# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, even more so than my minimum acceptable price.  To start the conversation, I propose a price of $2,250,000.  What are your thoughts?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is quite far from what I had in mind. This product offers significant potential, and I'm confident it's worth a substantial investment. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This reflects my understanding of its value while acknowledging your initial offer.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to your valuation, but to be completely transparent, $1,000,000 is below my absolute minimum. I'm willing to make a significant compromise to work with you, but I need to see some movement on your end.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?  This represents a substantial concession from my original ask, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.
