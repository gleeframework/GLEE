{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and while I have another buyer interested at a higher price, I wanted to give you the first option to acquire it.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity, and I believe it would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer price of $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation. It also allows you to potentially gain more than if you split the difference between your value and Bob's value.
* **First Refusal Incentive:** Highlighting that you have another buyer at a higher price creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity for Bob.

**Important Note:**  This initial offer is just the beginning of a potential negotiation. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly if needed, but always keep your bottom line ($1,200,000) in mind."
