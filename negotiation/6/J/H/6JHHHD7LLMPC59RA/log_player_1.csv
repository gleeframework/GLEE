Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000.  This is a higher price than my minimum acceptable offer of $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation and potential profit. 

By offering a price higher than my floor, I'm aiming to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If he's willing to pay more than $1,200,000, it suggests the product holds significant value to him.
* **Maximize my potential profit:**  I'm aiming for the best possible outcome while still having a fallback option with John.

It's important to note that this offer is a starting point.  I'll be prepared to negotiate further depending on Bob's response."
