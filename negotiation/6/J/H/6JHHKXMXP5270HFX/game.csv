"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but leaves room for both of us to make a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,150,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but my final offer is $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us both. ",1250000.0,Alice,5,
