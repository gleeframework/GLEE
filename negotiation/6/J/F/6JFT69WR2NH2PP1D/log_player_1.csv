Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair.  What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, but that's my absolute top limit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While $1,000,000 is a significant profit, it's still a long way from Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation. Selling to John would be leaving a lot of money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to $1,200,000 for this to make sense for me. I'm confident that you'll see a significant return on this investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's try to bridge that gap. I can go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the potential value you've outlined.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

We're getting closer, but there's still a significant gap between Bob's offer and his perceived value. It's worth another counteroffer to see if we can push a bit further."

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm trying to find a number that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $1,080,000? This is a significant investment for you, but I believe the returns will be well worth it."",
