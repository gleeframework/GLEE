"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really like it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $90 is higher than your maximum budget of $100. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a counteroffer of $70, which is significantly lower than Alice's offer. This leaves room for negotiation and aims to get us closer to our target price.
* **Polite & Open to Negotiation:** The message is friendly and expresses interest in the product while also clearly stating our budget constraints.  This keeps the tone positive and encourages Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do a bit better than that, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $70. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's counteroffer of $82.50 is closer to our desired price range, it's still above our ideal budget. There's room for further negotiation, and we haven't reached a point where buying from John for $100 is more appealing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $82.50 is still a bit more than I had hoped to spend. Would you be willing to settle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're inching closer to a potential agreement. By countering with $75, we're aiming for a price that's roughly halfway between Alice's last offer and our previous counteroffer.
* **Maintaining Interest:** The message remains positive and appreciative of Alice's willingness to negotiate.  We want to keep the conversation going and avoid seeming inflexible. 
* **Deadline Awareness:**  While we're not explicitly mentioning John's offer, we're aware that time is a factor. We're hoping this counteroffer will either be accepted, or prompt Alice to make a counteroffer that is closer to our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go below $80, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $80. How about $77.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $77.50, which is a reasonable price and a good deal compared to John's offer of $100. It's unlikely we'll be able to negotiate a significantly better price with Alice, and further haggling might risk losing the deal.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a price well within our budget."
