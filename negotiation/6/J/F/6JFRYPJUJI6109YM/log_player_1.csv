Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell the product for that amount. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but shows I'm willing to compromise a bit. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While it's closer, it's not worth selling for less than my reserve. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, but it's still within my acceptable range. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value and Bob's increasing willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob seems unwilling to budge much from his initial offer. While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk a long back and forth with no guarantee of a satisfactory outcome. I'd rather secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John and move on."
