"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $175? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value the product at a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $185. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 185}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still feel that I might be able to secure the product elsewhere within my budget. Would it be possible for you to lower the price further to $170? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170

While haggling with Bob might result in a slightly higher sale price, it's clear he's aiming for a price well below my minimum. John offers a guaranteed $150, which is a fair baseline and avoids further negotiation."
