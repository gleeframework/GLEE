"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $15,000 to you, and you have the option of buying it from John for the same price, it makes no sense to accept Alice's offer. You can save money by rejecting her offer and buying from John."
