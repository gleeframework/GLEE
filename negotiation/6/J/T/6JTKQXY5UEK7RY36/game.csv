"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about $110? It's a good price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $107.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",107.5,Bob,4,
