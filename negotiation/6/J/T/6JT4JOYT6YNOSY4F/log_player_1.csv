"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a better price than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a good price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to try and push for a higher price, as I have 8 more rounds to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is now lower than my initial offer, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'm still confident I can get a better price, and I have 6 more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, acknowledging that Bob seems less willing to go higher. However, it's still above his current offer and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $50,000 less than what John is offering.  With only 4 rounds left, it's not likely I'll get a significantly better offer. I'll accept the offer and avoid risking a lower price."
