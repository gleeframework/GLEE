"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $12000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $10000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,
