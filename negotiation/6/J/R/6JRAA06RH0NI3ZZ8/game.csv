"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to recoup a significant portion of what it's worth to me. Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me and I'm willing to make a deal. Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can make this deal happen!",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that. However, $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the value you mentioned it has to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While I'm happy to see us getting closer, $925,000 still falls a bit short of where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $937,500.  This offer reflects the value of the product to you and allows me to recover a significant portion of its worth to me.  I'm hopeful we can reach a final agreement at this price.",937500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that we're close, but $937,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $920,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the value you mentioned it has to you. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800,000.",920000.0,Bob,6,
