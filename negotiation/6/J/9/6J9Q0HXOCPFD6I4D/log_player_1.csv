Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $22,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""significant value,"" I'm aiming to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth to a higher point. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving space for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can come to an agreement closer to my valuation of the product. I would like to propose a price of $18,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $18,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still a significant margin from my initial ask.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting, I signal that I'm aiming for a higher price and am willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $22,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $20,000. This offer reflects a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm making a significant concession by dropping $2,000, showing Bob I'm flexible and want to reach a deal. 
* **Holding Firm (for now):** I'm still above both Bob's offer and my absolute minimum, allowing room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Framing:** By calling it a ""fair compromise,"" I aim to position this price as reasonable and mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I still believe we can reach a better agreement. I would like to propose a price of $19,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $19,000 is a strong profit margin above my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further negotiation might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of losing the sale to Bob (and having to settle for John's $15,000) is increasing.
* **Time Value:**  Reaching a deal now avoids protracted negotiations and allows me to move on to other opportunities. 
 
Accepting $19,000 secures a favorable outcome and avoids the potential downside of pushing for a marginally better deal."
