"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $13,000. I believe this price reflects the value it holds, especially for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is less than Bob's maximum, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a lower price, potentially saving him even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $10,000.  Would you consider $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good compromise:**  $11,500 is significantly lower than Bob's maximum of $15,000, and it's likely Alice won't go lower.
* **Continuing negotiation is risky:**  There's a chance Bob could get a lower price, but there's also a chance Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John for $15,000. 
* **Accepting saves time and potential frustration:**  By accepting the offer, Bob secures the product at a good price and avoids further negotiation."
