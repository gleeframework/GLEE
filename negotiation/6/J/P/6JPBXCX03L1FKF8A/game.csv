"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, $8,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for countering, Alice. While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget.  Could you do $9,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good price for the product. How about we meet at $10,500? I think that's a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
