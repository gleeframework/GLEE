"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You value the product at $120, and her offer is $95, which means you'd be paying more than you're willing to.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have a clear upper limit ($120) and a lower limit (Alice's value of $80). There's space to negotiate a better price. 
* **John is a backup option.** If negotiations fail, you have a guaranteed way to buy the product for your maximum price. 

This strategy allows you to try and get a better price from Alice while keeping John as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.  
* **Within your budget:** This offer still keeps you within your maximum value of $120.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see if she's close to her lower limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your desired price point. You're looking to pay closer to $85.
* **Further negotiation is possible.** Since Alice is willing to negotiate, there's a chance you can get her down further.
* **John is a backup.** You can always fall back on John if negotiations fail.

By rejecting this offer, you continue to exert pressure on Alice to lower her price while keeping John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increase:** This counteroffer is slightly higher than your previous offer, signaling that you're willing to compromise.  
* **Still below Alice's offer:** It's still lower than Alice's current offer of $90, suggesting a willingness to meet in the middle. 
* **Testing for acceptance:** This counteroffer is a good test to see if Alice is close to her lower limit and if she's ready to accept a price close to your desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your desired price.** Her offer of $92 is much closer to your target range than her previous offers.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield much.**  While you might be able to get Alice down a few dollars more, the potential savings are likely outweighed by the time and effort involved.
* **John's price is significantly higher.** Buying from John would cost you $120, while accepting Alice's offer only costs $92, saving you $28.

At this point, it's more advantageous to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonable price, rather than risk further negotiation and potentially having to pay John's higher price."
