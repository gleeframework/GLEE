Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone with your insights, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,750,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage. Starting with a higher price of $1,750,000 allows room for negotiation. 
* **Value Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value, subtly justifying the high price without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is polite and open for discussion, encouraging Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging Bob's interest and leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
