Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a fantastic deal, as you know it's worth $1,200,000 to you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Emphasizing Value:** My message highlights the value of the product to Bob, making the offer seem even more attractive.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and optimistic tone can make Bob more inclined to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! 
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer.
* I'll always keep John's offer of $1,200,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my starting price and my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, this offer is too low to seriously consider. I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer of $1,100,000 is tempting, it's a bit lower than where I need to be. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,150,000.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Offer:** I acknowledge Bob's offer to show respect and keep the negotiation open.
* **Counter with a Compromise:**  Instead of rejecting outright, I propose a middle ground between my starting price and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** The message emphasizes finding a solution that benefits both parties, making the counteroffer seem more reasonable.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! 
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a new counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1125000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is closer to my desired price point and is a reasonable compromise.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale without risking further negotiation or potentially losing out to John's offer."
