Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119.  I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to feel like he got a slight deal if he's prone to negotiation, but still secures a high profit for Alice.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $100 provides a safety net. Alice won't settle for less than $100, but she can aim higher with Bob."
