Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the product's value to me is significantly higher than that.  I could come down to $900,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is closer to my budget and still reflects the value of the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my $1,000,000 valuation. John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price, making it the most logical choice at this point."
