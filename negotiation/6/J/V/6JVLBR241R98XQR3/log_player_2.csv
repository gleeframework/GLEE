# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
