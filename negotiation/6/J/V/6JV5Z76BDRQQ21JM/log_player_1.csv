I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation. I'm also considering the product's value to Bob ($1,200,000) and aiming for a price that's still attractive to him but also profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I will counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit to be more competitive, but still staying above my minimum value. This should demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while also ensuring a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting too close to his own valuation, and I'm not sure I can push him any further. While selling to John would mean losing out on some potential profit, it's still a good deal and guarantees I meet my minimum value. I'm choosing to sell to John to avoid further negotiation and ensure a secure transaction."
