"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  My initial offer is $1000000.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850000 is a step in the right direction, it's still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $925000. This would give us both a good deal and allow us to move forward.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Alice, but $925000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $900000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to come up on your offer. However, $900000 still doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of this product and allows us to both walk away feeling satisfied.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Alice, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more offer: $920000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",920000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer and your willingness to negotiate. While $920000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a little lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time and offer $935000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of this product. I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this agreement.",935000.0,Alice,7,
