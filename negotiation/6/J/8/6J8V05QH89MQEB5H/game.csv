"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This price reflects its value and provides a fair margin for both of us. I'm confident you'll find this to be a great deal, considering the product's worth to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is still quite a bit below the value of this product to me.  I'm willing to compromise, and I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,100,000, so I'm offering $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
