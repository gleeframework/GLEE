"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $14,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value I have in mind for the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair price given my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,5,
