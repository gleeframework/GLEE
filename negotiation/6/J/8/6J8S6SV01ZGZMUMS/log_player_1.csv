I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and what his budget might be."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy with $15,000, I believe I can potentially get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with my counteroffer.  $18,000 is still a good profit for me, but it shows a willingness to negotiate. I'll see if he's willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is only $1,000 less than my initial offer and $1,000 more than John's offer. I think it's a good deal, so I'll accept it."
