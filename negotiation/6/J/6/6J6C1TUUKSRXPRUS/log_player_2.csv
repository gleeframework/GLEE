Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $200 for it. Let me know what you think!

$200 is way above your budget. You'll try to negotiate with Alice first."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $175. That's a significant reduction from my initial price and a fair price for this great product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$175 is still too high, and you're not sure it's worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice. You'll try to counteroffer again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $175 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100, which is a fair compromise,  and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $100 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $130 is closer to your budget, it's still too high. You're determined to see if you can get it for less and still prefer negotiating with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $110, which is a fair compromise. Let's try to make this work, I really do want to buy the product!  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work.  I'm going to have to push my budget a bit to get this product, so my final offer is $115.  This is the highest I can go, so if it doesn't work, I'll have to look elsewhere.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
