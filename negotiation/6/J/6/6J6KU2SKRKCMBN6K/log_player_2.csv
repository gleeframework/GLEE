"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really like it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $100 for the product.  Alice's offer of $110 is higher than your maximum.  Since you can get the product from John for $100, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the better option."
