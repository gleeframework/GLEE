"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good profit and me a significant investment.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay right now.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows for a good deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that we've reached the optimal price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
