"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $10,500?  This price still gives you a significant advantage, and it's a fair compromise for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're trying to get a good price, but $9,800 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's go with $10,150. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",10150.0,Alice,5,
