"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's something you see value in, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit you. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is better than buying from John for $1,200,000. Even though Bob values the product at $1,200,000, accepting Alice's offer saves him $50,000."
