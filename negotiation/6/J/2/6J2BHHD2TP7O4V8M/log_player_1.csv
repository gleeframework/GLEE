Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000 (your value from selling to John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin for Bob if he buys from you.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob finds the deal attractive enough to accept. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little incentive for Bob.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's something you see value in, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit you. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Fair:**  $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It captures a significant portion of the potential value for you while still leaving Bob with a $50,000 gain.
* **Positive Language:** The message emphasizes mutual benefit and value, making it more likely for Bob to engage positively. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-negotiate. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go before accepting John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000."
