Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. This way, I can potentially maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $100 for the product. I hope this offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120? I'm willing to negotiate further, but I can't go any lower than that."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```
 
I'm trying to find a middle ground that's closer to my desired price while still being appealing enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still looking to keep the cost below $100 if possible. Would $95 be within your range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that low. John is offering me my desired price, and I'd rather secure that guaranteed amount than continue to negotiate with Bob and risk getting an even lower offer."
