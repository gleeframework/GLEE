# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,500,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, but I think that's still a bit high. I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value beyond even your initial assessment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? I think that's a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what we're discussing.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While I'm willing to be flexible, I can't go as low as $1,150,000.  To move things forward, I'd consider $1,275,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it's a very fair offer.
