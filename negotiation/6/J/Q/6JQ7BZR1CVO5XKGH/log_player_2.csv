(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I understand your budget constraints, but this product is worth significantly more. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's a fair price considering the value this product will bring you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $7,500 is still below what I need for this product.  It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be beneficial to your business.  How about we settle at $8,500? It's a fair compromise, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

Alice is unlikely to go below $8,500.  It's better to secure the $8,000 price with John than to risk further negotiation with Alice."
