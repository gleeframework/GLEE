"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a better agreement.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $125?  It's still a great price for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $122.50?",122.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. How about $124? It's only a small difference from your offer, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!",124.0,Alice,5,
