Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a better agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now.  While $120 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $120 is a bit too low for me.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $122.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  While $122.50 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. How about $124? It's only a small difference from your offer, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 124}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not quite there. How about we try $123.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $123.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $123.5

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $123.50.  This is a good deal for me, considering I'm only $6.50 away from my ideal price. It's also better than selling to John for $100, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds."
