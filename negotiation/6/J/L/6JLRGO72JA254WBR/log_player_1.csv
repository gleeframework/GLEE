Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get more than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  It's a good starting point, and I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe I can still get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still closer to my desired price than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a more agreeable price for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, it's not worth risking a further negotiation and potentially losing the sale altogether.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent profit, and it's likely that Bob won't go higher."
