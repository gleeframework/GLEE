"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,800,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $1,150,000? I think that's a fair price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you said that was your final offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers to close this out.  $1,225,000 and we have a deal.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,225,000. I'm thinking of a price of $1,350,000. This is still a compromise, but I need to ensure I get a good deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
