"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, and I believe it could be valuable to you too. Let's discuss a fair price. How about $150?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out.",80.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we meet halfway? I'll propose a price of $95 for the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $80.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering I'm ready to purchase now. Let's finalize the deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
