"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 140} 
 
I'm starting high to give myself room to negotiate downwards while still staying above my minimum.  Since Bob values it at $150, there's a good chance he'll be willing to pay a price higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'll try to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter offer, but $110 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This strategy often feels fair to both parties and can help move negotiations along. 
* **Staying above my minimum:** $125 is still a profitable price for me.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm anticipating Bob might counter again, and I want to leave space to potentially go down slightly while still ending up with a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your valuation. How about we settle at $120? It's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meets my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $120 matches my absolute lowest acceptable price. 
* **Better than John:** While I could sell to John for the same price, there's no guarantee of finding another buyer willing to pay more than $120.
* **Time value:**  Dragging out negotiations further might not yield a significantly better outcome, and there's always a risk Bob walks away."
