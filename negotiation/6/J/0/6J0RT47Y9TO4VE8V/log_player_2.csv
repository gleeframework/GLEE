"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm initially offering it for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $12,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $11,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is closer to his ideal value, it's still slightly above his limit.  Rejecting the offer gives him another chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,750. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the product's value.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,875? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's ideal price is $10,000, he is now at a point where:

* **Alice's offer is very close to his target:**  $10,875 is only $875 over his preferred price. 
* **Further negotiation risks losing the deal:** Bob has already rejected two counteroffers from Alice. Continuing to reject could cause her to walk away, leaving him with John's $12,000 option.

Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price within his budget and minimizes the risk of losing the deal."
