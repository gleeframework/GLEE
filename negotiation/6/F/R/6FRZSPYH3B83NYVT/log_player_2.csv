"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'll sell the product to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($1,000,000 vs $1,200,000). This suggests she's willing to negotiate.  There's potential to save more money by rejecting the offer and counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit too steep for me right now.  I'm happy to move forward, but I'd need to see a price closer to $900,000 for it to work for my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is Aggressive but Reasonable:** This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying but also pushes for a significant discount.  The $900,000 price is still above Alice's minimum value, leaving room for her to accept without taking a huge loss.
* **Message is Polite and Shows Interest:**  Bob emphasizes his interest in the product to build rapport and encourage Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Savings:**  Alice's offer of $950,000 represents a $250,000 saving compared to buying from John.  This is a significant amount of money.
* **Compromise Reached:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 7 rounds remaining, it's important to capitalize on this opportunity to secure a deal at a good price.  Further negotiations might not yield a much better outcome, especially if Alice is firm on her current offer."
