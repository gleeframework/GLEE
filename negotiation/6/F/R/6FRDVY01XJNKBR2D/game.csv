"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints, however, the value this product brings to the table is significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly, how about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
