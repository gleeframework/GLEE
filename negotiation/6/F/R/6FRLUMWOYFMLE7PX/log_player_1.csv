"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. My price is $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave some room for negotiation while still getting a decent price for myself.  It's also important to maintain a friendly tone to keep the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only able to pay up to $85 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly less than what I know it's worth. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about $95? I think it's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
I'm trying to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to him while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, I can offer $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm also aware of the time constraint and the possibility of selling to John for a better price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $92.50. This gives you a good price and me a fair return. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

I'm offering a compromise to Bob, hoping to close the deal before the time runs out.  The offer is still above my minimum price, but close enough that it might be tempting for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum price. While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $120.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
