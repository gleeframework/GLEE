# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this amazing product, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $9,500.** This is less than your maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Buying from John would cost you $12,000.** 
* **Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $2,500.** 

It's always better to get a lower price, even if it's just a small amount, when you have an alternative option."
