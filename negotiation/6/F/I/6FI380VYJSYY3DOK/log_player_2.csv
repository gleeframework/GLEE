Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,800 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,800. I'm thinking of making a counteroffer of $9,200. It's a bit of a compromise, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know what you think.

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice has come down from her initial price, $9,200 is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  John offers the product for $8,000, which is within Bob's budget.  It's best for Bob to take the deal with John and save the money."
