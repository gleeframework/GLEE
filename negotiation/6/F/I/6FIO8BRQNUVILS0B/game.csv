"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $600,000 is significantly below my desired price, I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to facilitate this deal. This price still allows me to recoup a reasonable amount of the product's value, and I'm confident it's a fair offer for both of us. Let me know if this works for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
