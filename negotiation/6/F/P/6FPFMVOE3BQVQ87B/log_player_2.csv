{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds to work with, so it's worth trying to get a better price.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. It shows you're serious about negotiating and willing to push for a lower price.
* **Reasoning:**  The message provides a reason for the counteroffer, making it less likely to be rejected outright.  
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** While $950,000 is still above your ideal price, it allows for some give-and-take in future rounds."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. How about $980,000?
