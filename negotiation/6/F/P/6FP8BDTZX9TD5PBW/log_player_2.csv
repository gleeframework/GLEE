"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the initial offer. While it's a good starting point, Bob can likely get a better price.  He has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer allows him to begin the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** Bob is aiming to get a lower price than Alice's initial offer. He's starting with a counteroffer of $750,000, which is still higher than Alice's valuation, but a substantial saving for Bob.
* **Message:** The message is friendly but firm. It acknowledges Alice's offer while stating Bob's intention to negotiate a lower price. It also emphasizes the profit potential for Alice at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $850000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offer. While $850,000 is a better price than the initial $900,000, Bob can likely still get a lower price. He's aiming to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer allows him to keep negotiating.  He's demonstrated a willingness to compromise, and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate.  By continuing to make counteroffers, Bob increases the chance of getting the price closer to his desired target."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $800,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while giving me a good deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** Bob is increasing his offer to $800,000. This is a significant move closer to Alice's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good price.
* **Message:** The message continues to be friendly but firm. It acknowledges Alice's previous offer and emphasizes the fairness of this counteroffer for both parties. It highlights the profit potential for Alice and the attractive price for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $825000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm still confident it's a great deal for you. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:**  Accepting $825,000 results in a saving of $375,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and further negotiation might not yield much more savings.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Continuing to reject offers risks Alice walking away or becoming less willing to negotiate in the future. 

While Bob could continue to negotiate, the potential savings are likely not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether. At this point, accepting Alice's offer represents a substantial savings and a successful negotiation outcome."
