"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale, and $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming closer to my price range, Alice. While $825,000 is better, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to settle at $760,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I can do $795,000, and that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer.",795000.0,Alice,5,
