Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a good deal while still allowing you to earn a considerable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,300,000. This shows flexibility while still leaving room for some profit. It's also a more reasonable middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I won't be able to negotiate a much higher price in the next round.  It's better to secure the sale now and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
