Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is quite high. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd like to propose a price of $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential and my willingness to purchase it.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach our minimum price of $1,000,000. We have a guaranteed offer from John at that price. It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale."
