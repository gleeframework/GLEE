"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $750,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible, so he's offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to pay a lower price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price and closer to Bob's ideal price. Accepting the offer allows Bob to save a substantial amount of money compared to buying from John. Further negotiation might result in a lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting a lower offer and ultimately needing to buy from John outweighs the potential savings."
