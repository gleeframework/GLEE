"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $11,000.  I'm seeing a lot of value in this product, and I'm confident it's worth more than that. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it reflects the true value of what I'm offering.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still believe that $11,000 is a fair price for the product. I would like to stick with that offer.",11000.0,Bob,6,
