"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to be budget-conscious, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I could meet you halfway at $12,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still offering you a good deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am still not able to exceed $10,000 for this product. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in between $10,000 and $12,000?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for working with me on this.  I value finding a fair deal. How about we split the difference between your last offer and mine, and settle on $11,250? This gets us closer to a win-win.",11250.0,Alice,5,
