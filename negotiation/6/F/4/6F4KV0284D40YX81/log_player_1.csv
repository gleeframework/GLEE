``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, leaving room for potential counteroffers while still maximizing my potential profit.  I've chosen to phrase my message in a way that highlights the value for Bob while also keeping the tone positive and encouraging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I am willing to pay $810000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is willing to pay, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $800,000.  I believe I can still achieve a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $810,000 is quite a bit below what I believe the product is worth.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $880,000 for the product. This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to achieve a fair price."", ""product_price"": 880000}
```"

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $870,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I will continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of achieving a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $870,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $860,000.  This would allow me to achieve a fair price while still providing you with a significant discount compared to the product's value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $865,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $865,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $865,000 is finally above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target,  I've been negotiating for several rounds and it's getting close to the end.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a profit and keeps me from risking a lower price from John."
