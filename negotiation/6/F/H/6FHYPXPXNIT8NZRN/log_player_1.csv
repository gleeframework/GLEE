Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000.  This is the price I need to get to feel comfortable with the sale.  While I know the product is worth less to Bob, I want to see if he's willing to pay top dollar.  If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and potentially negotiate, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John at any moment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum asking price.  While I'm open to negotiation,  I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial asking price, but it's still above what Bob offered. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still holding out for a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I would like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob is proving to be a tough negotiator. I'm worried that if I continue to counteroffer, we'll get stuck in a back-and-forth that could drag on and ultimately lead to a lower price.  John is a safe bet, offering me my minimum asking price. I'm going to sell to John."
