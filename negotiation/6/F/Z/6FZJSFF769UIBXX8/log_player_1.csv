Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus to be split.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John's offer, giving you a negotiating advantage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high without alienating Bob completely.  Here's a balanced approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Tone:**  You're highlighting the product's value to make the price seem more reasonable.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 leaves you with a significant profit margin ($150,000 over your minimum) while still giving Bob a compelling reason to buy ($50,000 savings).

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:**  Bob might counter-offer. Have a strategy for potential concessions while keeping your minimum price in mind. 
* **Relationship Matters:** While maximizing profit is key, consider the long-term implications if you push too hard and sour the relationship with a potentially valuable contact like Bob."
