Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let me know what you think.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering the value I place on this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Bob seems firm on his $1,050,000 offer. It's unlikely he'll go much higher. Accepting his offer means losing a significant amount compared to John's guaranteed offer. It's time to move on."
