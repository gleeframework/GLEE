Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$850,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than the product's value to Bob but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly but firm, emphasizing the value of the product to Bob. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a good price:**  The initial offer is above Bob's value, potentially leading to a higher final price.
* **Initiate negotiation:** It leaves space for Bob to counter, allowing for a more dynamic exchange.
* **Maintain a backup plan:** The threat of selling to John ensures that Alice doesn't accept a price significantly lower than the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to the product's value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm confident that I can get a better price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $775,000 is still too low. The product is worth a lot more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  $825,000 is a reasonable compromise that is closer to my desired price but still leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product while acknowledging Bob's financial situation.

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a higher price:**  The counteroffer moves the price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Maintain momentum:** It keeps the negotiation going without immediately resorting to selling to John.
* **Signal flexibility:** While rejecting Bob's offer, I am still willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $750,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to risk further rounds of back-and-forth that could potentially lead to an even lower price.  Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees me a fair deal and avoids the potential for a prolonged and unproductive negotiation."
