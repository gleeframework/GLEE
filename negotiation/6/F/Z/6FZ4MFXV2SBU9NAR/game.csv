"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $775,000 is still too low. The product is worth a lot more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $750,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
