Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, and I do see the potential value in this product. However, $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $900000.  This reflects my understanding of the market value for similar products, and I believe it's a fair price that would benefit both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
