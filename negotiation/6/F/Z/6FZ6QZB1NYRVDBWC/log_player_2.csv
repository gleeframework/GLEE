"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is extremely valuable, and I believe it could be a game-changer for your business. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1200000.  This is a significant discount from its true worth, and I'm confident it's a price you'll find attractive. Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is below your maximum price, but there's room for negotiation.**  You want to see if you can get a better price.
* **You're not desperate.** You have an alternative seller (John) at a higher price, giving you bargaining power. 

By rejecting the offer, you can start a negotiation process and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, and I do see the potential value in this product. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This reflects my understanding of the market value for similar products, and I believe it's a fair price that would benefit both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for your counteroffer (market value) makes it more credible.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message ends on a positive note, suggesting you're open to further discussion.

By making a bold counteroffer, you're putting pressure on Alice to either accept or come back with a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is a bit too low for me considering the unique value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1050000? This price still gives you a significant advantage and allows us to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is closer to your desired price, but still leaves room for improvement.** You've already made a substantial move from her initial price, and you can likely get it even lower.
* **You have a fallback option.**  Being able to buy from John for $1,500,000 gives you leverage to hold out for a better deal.

By rejecting the offer, you can continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to your target of $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,050,000 is closer to where I'd like to be, I'm still not quite there. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to offer $975,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental move:**  This counteroffer is a smaller increase from your previous offer, showing you're getting closer to her price but still holding firm.
* **Emphasis on value:**  Reiterating the value of the product to justify your price.
* **Positive tone:**  The message remains positive, suggesting a willingness to reach a solution.

By making a smaller counteroffer, you're showing flexibility while still aiming to close the gap towards your desired price."
