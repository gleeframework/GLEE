"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,000 for it. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $11,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message helps establish a positive relationship and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:**  Highlighting the product's potential value to Bob can make him more likely to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to keep my budget under $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there is still room for negotiation.  I can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is a Backup:**  The option to sell to John for $12,000 provides a safety net if the negotiations with Bob fail.  However, I want to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  It's a fair price that allows us both to get what we want."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($11,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Focusing on Fairness:** Emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price can make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation amicable and encourages Bob to continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Close:**  $10,000 is only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Risk of Losing a Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee that he'll come back with a better one. I risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Selling to John is an Option:**  While selling to John for $12,000 is attractive,  it's important to consider the potential for a deal with Bob to fall through in future rounds.  

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer to secure a sale and avoid the risk of a longer negotiation."
