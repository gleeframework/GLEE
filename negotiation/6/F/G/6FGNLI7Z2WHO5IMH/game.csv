"Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for a price of $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering the value you'll be getting. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,750,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $1,600,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering its value to you.  What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's close this deal and avoid any further back and forth.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
