"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is fair considering the product's value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective on the price. However, $18,000 represents the value this product brings, and I can't go as low as $12,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $15,000 is closer, I'm still only able to go up to $13,000. It's a fair compromise, considering your value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
At this point, accepting Bob's offer of $13,000 is the best move. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $13,000 is a $1,000 profit over John's guaranteed offer.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Negotiations take time. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the deal falling through. 
* **Uncertainty of Future Rounds:**  There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and we risk him walking away. 

While we could push for more, accepting a solid offer now minimizes risk and guarantees a good profit."
