I'm aiming for a higher price than $9,000, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}

I'll reject Bob's offer. I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $10,000.  We're nearing the midpoint between our desired prices, so I'll continue negotiating."

I've rejected Bob's last offer, and we're back to his original offer of $9,000.  We're running out of time, and I'm not going to get much closer to my desired price.  It's better to sell to John for $12,000 and ensure a better profit."
