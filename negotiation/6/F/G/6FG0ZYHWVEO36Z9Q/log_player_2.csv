"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He has a better option with John at $10,000, and he can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but unfortunately, $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 10500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of 10800. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice. He has the option of buying from John for $10,000, giving him a good baseline for negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,800 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $10,200. If we can meet somewhere in the middle, I believe we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between 10800 and 10200. How about we compromise at 10500? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. Alice is now offering $10,500, which is the same price as John's offer.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll get a better price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures he gets the product at his desired price without risking a breakdown in negotiations."
