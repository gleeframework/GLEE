Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.,11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but unfortunately, $11000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 10500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of 10800. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10800 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $10200. If we can meet somewhere in the middle, I believe we can reach a deal.",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between 10800 and 10200. How about we compromise at 10500? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
