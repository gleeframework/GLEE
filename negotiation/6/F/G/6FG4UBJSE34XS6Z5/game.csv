"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. That's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make a profit. Let's meet halfway.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but I can't go lower than $8,250.  That's still a significant discount from my original asking price, and it's the absolute lowest I can go. Let's close this deal, what do you say?",8250.0,Alice,5,
