Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $115 for it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than what Bob values the product at, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning in the message:**  I'm trying to pique Bob's interest by suggesting it's a good fit for him, which might make him more likely to accept a higher price.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not giving away the product for less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  $100 is my absolute minimum, and Bob's offer is at that minimum.  
* **Potential for better:**  While I could accept, there's a chance I can get a higher price if I counteroffer. 
* **John's offer:** I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, as I have a guaranteed $120 offer from John.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, likely starting at $110 and seeing if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit to $110, but that's my final offer. This product really is a great value for the price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by dropping my price, but I'm still keeping it above my absolute minimum.
* **Value proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to try to sway him towards accepting my counteroffer.
* **Finality:** Stating that this is my final offer creates pressure for Bob to accept, as he knows I'm not likely to go lower."
