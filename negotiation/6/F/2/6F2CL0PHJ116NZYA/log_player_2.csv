"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $950,000. It's worth $1,000,000 to you, so this is a great opportunity to secure a valuable asset at a price that's still a good deal for you. If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $800,000, so you'd be missing out on a chance to save $50,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Value to Bob:**  $1,000,000
* **Alice's Offer:** $950,000
* **John's Price:** $1,000,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $50,000 compared to buying from John. Even though Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum value, it's still a good deal because it's lower than John's price."
