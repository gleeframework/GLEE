"Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $950,000. It's worth $1,000,000 to you, so this is a great opportunity to secure a valuable asset at a price that's still a good deal for you. If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $800,000, so you'd be missing out on a chance to save $50,000. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,1,
