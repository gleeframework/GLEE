Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I believe it could be very valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $10,000 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy. 
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so offering it slightly below his valuation won't work.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning another buyer (John) might pressure Bob, but it could also make him feel manipulated. A softer approach focusing on Bob's potential gain is more likely to succeed.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $9,500 is the initial offer, there might be room for slight negotiation if Bob counters."
