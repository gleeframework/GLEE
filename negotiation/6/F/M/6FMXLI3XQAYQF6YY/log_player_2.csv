# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely do better."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

``` 

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer and is now at $875,000.  This is a good price, and it's unlikely you'll be able to get a much better deal. It's time to accept and secure the product."
