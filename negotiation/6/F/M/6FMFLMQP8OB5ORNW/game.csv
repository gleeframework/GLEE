"Alice, $2,000,000 is far too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is significantly lower.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price reflects a significant discount from my original offer and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to find a solution.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still outside my range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  Let's try to bridge the gap.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your efforts to negotiate, $950,000 is still significantly lower than what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000.  This price offers a reasonable compromise and allows us to close this deal.  Let's make this happen.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,075,000 is still stretching my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but it's still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the closest I can go.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
