{""message"": ""Alice, $2,000,000 is far too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is significantly lower.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price reflects a significant discount from my original offer and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to find a solution.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your efforts to negotiate, $950,000 is still significantly lower than what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000.  This price offers a reasonable compromise and allows us to close this deal.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,075,000 is still stretching my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but it's still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the closest I can go.  Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than my preferred price range. Although I have two more rounds of negotiation, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further. Buying from John for $800,000 is the most financially sound decision at this point. It allows me to get the product within my budget and avoid further negotiation that might not yield a favorable outcome."
