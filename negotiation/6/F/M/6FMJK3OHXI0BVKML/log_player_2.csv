"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's something you value at $100, and I'm willing to let it go for $90.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer of $90 is less than your maximum of $100 and also less than buying from John for $100. This saves you money and gets you the product."
