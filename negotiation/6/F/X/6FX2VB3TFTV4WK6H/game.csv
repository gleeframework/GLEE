"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant concession, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price, given the value of the product and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and accept $925,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and my need to make a profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
