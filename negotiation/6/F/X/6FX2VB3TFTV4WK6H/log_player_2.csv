"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fantastic deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget, so you should reject it. You can try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant concession, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above your budget. You can try to negotiate further.  $950,000 is still closer to John's price than your ideal, so negotiating further is worth the risk."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and accept $925,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and my need to make a profit. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still above your budget. While you could continue to negotiate, it's likely that you'll only be able to shave off a small amount.  John's offer of $800,000 is a better deal and you can secure the product without further negotiation."
