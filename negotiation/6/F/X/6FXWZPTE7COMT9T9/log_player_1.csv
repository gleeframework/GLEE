Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to Bob's perceived value of $15,000.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build rapport with Bob and make him more likely to engage. 
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the ""great deal"" and the product's value helps Bob see the potential benefit of accepting the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I will assess Bob's response (accept, reject, or counteroffer).
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** If Bob makes a counteroffer, I'll evaluate its reasonableness and either accept it (if it's close to my desired price), make a counter-counteroffer (if it's too low), or walk away (if it's too far from what I'm willing to accept).
* **John's Offer:**  Throughout the negotiation, I'll keep John's offer of $8,000 in mind as my fallback option. This ensures I don't get stuck in a negotiation that ends up below my minimum acceptable price."
