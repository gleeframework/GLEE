"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $100, which would be $105. Would you be willing to consider that?",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make a small concession, so I'll meet you at $102.50. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",102.5,Alice,5,
