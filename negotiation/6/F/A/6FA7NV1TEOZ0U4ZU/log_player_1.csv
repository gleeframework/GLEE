Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's value to you, the message hints at it by mentioning ""its value."" This subtly justifies the higher asking price. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer allows you to assess Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects, you can negotiate down towards your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  Remember, your absolute minimum is $12,000 because you have John as a guaranteed buyer."
