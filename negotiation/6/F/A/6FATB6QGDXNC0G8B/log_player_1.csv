{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. My asking price is $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100) to give myself some room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and optimistic to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm better off selling to John for $100.  This guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiation."
