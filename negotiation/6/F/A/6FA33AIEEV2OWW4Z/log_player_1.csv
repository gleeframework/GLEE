"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum, but not so high that it seems unreasonable. I'll see how Bob reacts before adjusting my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's my minimum, I believe I can get more. It's too early in the negotiation to accept his first counteroffer. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $175. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price higher than my minimum.  We're still early in the process, so I don't want to drop too low too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $160 is closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a slightly better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm counteroffering at $165. We're getting closer to a deal. Bob seems to be willing to go a bit higher than his initial $150, so I'm sticking with a price closer to the middle ground. This should hopefully lead to a successful negotiation in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's only $5 more than what John is offering, we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. I'd rather close the deal with Bob than risk losing out on the chance for a slightly better price and potentially getting nothing from John."
