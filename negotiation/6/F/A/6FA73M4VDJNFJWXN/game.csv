"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1200000. This is a significant discount from its true market value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering your asking price and my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1050000. This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows us to close the deal.  Let's reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to compromise further.  $975000 is still a bit below my desired price point, but I'm willing to offer the product for $1000000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs, and I'm confident that we can close the deal. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1000000 is getting closer to where I need to be, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $990000 for the product.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows us to reach an agreement quickly.  Let's settle this today.",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your continued efforts to negotiate.  While $990000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher figure.  Let's split the difference and go with $995000.  This ensures we both get a good outcome, and we can finalize the deal quickly.  What do you say?",995000.0,Alice,7,
