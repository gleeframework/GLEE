"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,200. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $9,200 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still a bit hesitant.  How about $8,750? This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to both of us, and I believe it's a deal we can both agree on.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're getting close to your target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $9,400. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $9,400 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $8,900? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can reach an agreement.",8900.0,Bob,6,
