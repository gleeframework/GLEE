# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be happy to pay $850,000 for it.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $875,000.  This price allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $875000 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $925000, as that would be below my minimum acceptable price.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to meet your minimum acceptable price, but $910,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm willing to offer you $900,000.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $915000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:**  This is Round 9, leaving only one more round.
* **Close to Acceptable:**  $915,000 is closer to Bob's desired price than John's offer of $1,200,000.
* **Potential of Rejection:**  If Bob rejects, there's a chance Alice will not budge further in the final round, forcing Bob to buy from John at a significantly higher price. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting the offer is the most strategic move, as it secures the product at a price that is better than John's, even though it's slightly above Bob's initial goal."
