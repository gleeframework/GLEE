"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $150. This gives me room to negotiate and still earn more than my minimum of $150.  I'm aiming for a quick deal, but I'm also prepared to go through the rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $155 is more than my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with that price. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a price above Bob's initial counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $158. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $158
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $158 is getting closer to my ideal price and is definitely better than selling to John for $150.  While I'd like to squeeze out a few more dollars, I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal."
