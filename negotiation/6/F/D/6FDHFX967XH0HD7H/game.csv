"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm confident that we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a strong return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This price reflects its true worth while still acknowledging your initial offer.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
