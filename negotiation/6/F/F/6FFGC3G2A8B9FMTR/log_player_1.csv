Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Could we agree on $12,000? It's a fantastic product and a fair price."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
