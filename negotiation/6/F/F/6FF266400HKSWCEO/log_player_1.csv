Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $12,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  $11,000 is higher than what Bob believes the product is worth, giving him a reason to consider it. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** I'm not asking for my full desired price, leaving room for Bob to counter and for us to potentially meet in the middle. 
* **It's close enough to my desired price:** If Bob accepts, I'll make a good profit. 
* **It's a friendly approach:** I'm trying to build a good rapport with Bob and make the negotiation feel less adversarial."
