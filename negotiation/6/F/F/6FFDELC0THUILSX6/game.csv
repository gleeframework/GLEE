"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? I think that's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. Let me know if that works for you!",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $9,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000. Would that work for you?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price down to $9,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $9,200? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. Let me know if that works for you!",9200.0,Alice,5,
