Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 leaves little room for negotiation and might scare him off. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You highlight the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value,"" framing it positively.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 gives Bob a $150,000 discount (still significant) while earning you a $150,000 profit over your minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even without explicitly naming John) encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiation style and risk tolerance."
