"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm suggesting a price of $135 for it. This is a fair deal considering its worth to you is $120. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $135 is closer to your $120 limit than her initial value, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  Rejecting her offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer closer to your price, or you can simply proceed with buying from John."
