"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's $100,000 less than Alice's offer. This is a significant reduction, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob wants to push Alice towards a lower price, but also wants to avoid risking her walking away entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is $30,000 lower than her previous offer and is within Bob's budget. It's also significantly better than buying from John. While there's still a chance Bob could get a lower price by continuing to negotiate, the risk of Alice walking away or raising her price again is present. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a decent price and minimizes risk."
