Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate if necessary, and it also shows that I'm confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $75? I'm really interested in your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum price of $80. While I'm interested in selling to Bob, I'm not willing to go below my minimum threshold. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're looking for a good price. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make on this sale."", ""product_price"": 85} 
``` 

I'm offering $85, which is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to compromise.  It also keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $85 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $80, which is my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has offered my minimum price of $80.  While I'd prefer to make a bit more, it's in my best interest to accept his offer rather than risk losing him and having to settle with John for the same price."
