"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is designed to revolutionize your business operations. It comes with cutting-edge features and exceptional support. For this unique opportunity, I'm offering it to you at an exclusive price of $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in your product, but $15,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  Bob needs to start negotiating aggressively to bring the price down. A $5,000 reduction from Alice's initial offer is a significant starting point.
* **Staying Within Budget:**  $10,000 is still within Bob's $12,000 limit, leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a polite and interested tone,  encouraging Alice to consider the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understand your budget constraints. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to ensure we both benefit from this transaction. Would you be open to purchasing the product for $12500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Budget:** While Alice's offer of $12,500 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still $500 above his maximum. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  Alice is showing flexibility, indicating there's likely room for further negotiation.
* **Option to Buy from John:**  Bob still has the option to buy from John for $12,000, making this a safer choice for now.

**Next Steps:**  Bob should aim for a lower price with a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?  That's my absolute limit, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This counteroffer sets Bob's firm price limit at $12,000, highlighting the potential for a deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message continues to be polite and emphasizes a shared benefit for both parties.
* **No Room for Error:**  Bob has reached his maximum budget, and any higher price makes John's offer more attractive."
