"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Appealing Message:** I'm trying to pique Bob's interest and highlight the product's value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer gives Bob a chance to counter without feeling like he's being taken advantage of."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:** While $100 is a good price, I'm aiming for a higher return. 
* **Room for more negotiation:** I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point.
* **Testing the waters:** Rejecting the offer gives me the opportunity to see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product or just trying to get a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  Let's split the difference. How about $110? "", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous one.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $110 is still a good price for me, especially since I'm aiming for a higher return than John's offer.
* **Urgency Implied:**  The message implies that I'm willing to compromise but not necessarily desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $105? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** $105 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price, so I can afford to hold out for a better offer.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe there's still room to get closer to my desired price point.
* **Risk Assessment:** While selling to John for $80 is a guaranteed outcome, I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try $108.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession from my last offer, showing I'm still willing to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and potential benefits.
* **Finding Common Ground:** I'm suggesting a price that's closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a reasonable profit for myself.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  I don't want to let the negotiation stall, so I'm offering a price that's likely to be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $105 again? I'm willing to hold firm on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing a deal altogether.
* **Small Difference:** The difference between $105 and my desired price is minimal. 
* **No Guarantee:** There's no guarantee that Bob will accept a counteroffer, and it's possible we could end up selling to John for less. 
* **Time is Money:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
