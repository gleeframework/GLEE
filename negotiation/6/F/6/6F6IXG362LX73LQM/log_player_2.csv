* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $11,000, which is $1,000 less than John's price. 
* **The product is worth more to Bob than Alice:** Bob values the product at $12,000, while Alice values it at $10,000. This means there's still room for negotiation, but even at Alice's price, Bob is getting a good deal.
