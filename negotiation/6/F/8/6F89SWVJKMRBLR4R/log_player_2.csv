# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product has immense potential for you, given its value to your business. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. This price reflects its inherent worth while allowing for a substantial profit for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly better than John's price of $1,500,000, but there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth attempting to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $950000 is a good starting point, I need a price closer to $1100000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. This still offers you a significant profit, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.
