Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product which I believe you'll find valuable for a price of $9,500. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible without going below her minimum ($10,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can then slightly reduce the price while still staying above her minimum.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer before overthinking it.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. In a multi-round negotiation, Alice might adjust her approach based on Bob's responses."
