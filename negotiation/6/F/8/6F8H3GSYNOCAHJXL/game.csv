"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value it brings me. Let's make a deal!",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $950000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $950000 is still above what I can afford. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering our respective budgets and the value you've explained. Let's reach a final agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
