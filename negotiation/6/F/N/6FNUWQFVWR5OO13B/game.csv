"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I understand it's a significant investment, but I'm confident the product will provide you substantial value. How about we meet in the middle at $15,500? This price reflects the product's worth and allows for a fair negotiation. Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, but $15,500 is still a touch high for my budget. How about $13,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,250.  This price acknowledges your needs while ensuring I get a fair return. It's a final offer from me, let me know if you're interested.",14250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, this is a really nice product but I'm afraid I can't go higher than $14,000.  This is my final offer.",14000.0,Bob,6,
