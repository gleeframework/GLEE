"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $125 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about we settle at $115?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not ready to go as low as $115. How about we meet at $130? I'm willing to give you a slight discount from my initial offer, but I still need to make a profit.",130.0,Alice,5,
