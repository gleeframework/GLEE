Round 2

```

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to see how flexible Alice is."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still a bit higher than your budget, but it's getting closer. There's still potential to negotiate further down.  It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $125 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about we settle at $115?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not ready to go as low as $115. How about we meet at $130? I'm willing to give you a slight discount from my initial offer, but I still need to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```
