Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's below your minimum acceptable value:** You're still able to make a profit and avoid selling to John for a lower price. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground that encourages Bob to negotiate further, increasing the chances of a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable value of $15,000. While he's showing interest, accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for you.  Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to your target."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $13,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,000. How about $12,750? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum acceptable value, it's still below your target.  Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to your desired $15,000."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, Alice, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $12,750. I think that's the best I can do. Can you consider that?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The negotiations have reached a stalemate. Bob is unwilling to go any higher, and his offer is still below your minimum acceptable value of $15,000. Continuing to negotiate further is unlikely to result in a better offer from Bob, and it risks delaying the sale.  Selling the product to John for $15,000 ensures you achieve your desired profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
