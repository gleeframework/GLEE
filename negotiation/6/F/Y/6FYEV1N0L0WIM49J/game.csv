"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you consider my offer?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $13,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,000. How about $12,750? I think that's a fair compromise.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $12,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference again? $12,875 would be a good compromise, and it allows us both to find a price we're comfortable with.",12875.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your point, Alice, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $12,750. I think that's the best I can do. Can you consider that?",12750.0,Bob,6,
