{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still allows room for negotiation. It also gives Bob a sense of potential value without immediately pushing him away.  

I'm aware that I can sell to John for $12,000, but I want to see if I can secure a slightly higher price with Bob. If he rejects, I'll make a counteroffer based on his response, and if necessary, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to give away the product for a price that undervalues it. 

I'll counteroffer with a price that is closer to my minimum, but still leaves room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,000 is the highest I can go.  Let me know if that works. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it's a good deal considering the potential risk of further negotiation and the certainty of $12,000 from John.  I'm willing to take the slightly lower price to secure a sale and avoid the uncertainty of additional negotiations."
