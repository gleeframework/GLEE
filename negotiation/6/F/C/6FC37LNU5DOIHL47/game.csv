"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure $11,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still below my desired price. How about we split the difference at $11,250?  It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price, and I'd like to make one last offer. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider it?",10000.0,Bob,6,
