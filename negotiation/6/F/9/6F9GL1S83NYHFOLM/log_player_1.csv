Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and still offers Bob a good deal given his valuation of $1,200,000. 

By offering this price, I aim to:

* **Maximize my profit:**  A $1,000,000 sale would be a very good outcome for me. 
* **Keep the negotiation open:** A lower starting price might make Bob less willing to negotiate further. 
* **Test the waters:** I want to see how Bob responds to this initial offer to gauge his interest and potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, I believe I can still do better. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target of $1,000,000.  The next round will give me a chance to counter with a price that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering Bob's offer of $950,000 with a price of $975,000. This is a compromise: it's higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial proposal of $1,000,000. 

By offering $975,000, I aim to:

* **Show flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Get closer to my target:** $975,000 is closer to my desired outcome than Bob's offer.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  A reasonable counteroffer will likely encourage Bob to continue the discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer to get closer to my original target of $1,000,000, Bob's offer of $960,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant improvement over his previous offer, and it's much closer to my desired price than selling to John for $800,000.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal altogether outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
