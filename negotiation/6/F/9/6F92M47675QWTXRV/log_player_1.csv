Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is a good starting point considering my minimum is $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it also shows that I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still above my minimum price. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground and lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm accepting Bob's offer of $160.  While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum and  a reasonable compromise.  It's also higher than what John would pay, making it the best option for me at this point."
