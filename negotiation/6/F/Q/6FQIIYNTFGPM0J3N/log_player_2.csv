Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I believe this price still represents a good value for the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is getting closer to your ideal price, it's unlikely she'll go below $800,000. You have a guaranteed option with John at that price. It makes more sense to buy from John now and avoid further negotiation rounds."
