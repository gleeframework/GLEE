It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You can start by countering Alice's offer and see if she's willing to budge."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $85. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

Alice is willing to meet you halfway, so you can accept her offer and save $5. It's still within your budget and a better deal than buying from John."
