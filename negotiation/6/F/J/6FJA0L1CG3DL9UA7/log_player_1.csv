"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you.  Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your desired price to allow for some bargaining room.
* **Not Too High:**  While starting high, we don't want to alienate Bob with an outrageous price.  $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and potential benefits for Bob, aiming to create a positive perception."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Value:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's ample room for negotiation.  You started high, and Bob countered by meeting you ""halfway."" This suggests he's willing to move further.
* **John as Backup:** You have the security of selling to John for your minimum price. This allows you to be more assertive in the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, the price you offered is considerably below its true value. Let's find a middle ground – I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By decreasing the price, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Still Above Bob's Offer:** The counteroffer is strategically placed above Bob's offer, maintaining a strong negotiating position. 
* **Maintain Value Proposition:** The message reiterates the product's value, justifying the higher price point. This helps avoid appearing overly concessionary.
* **Leave Room:**  There's still a gap to close, allowing for further negotiation and potential concessions from both sides."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to offer $975,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** While Bob is moving, his concessions are getting smaller. This suggests he might be getting closer to his maximum. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We are now on Round 4 of 10. While not urgent, time is a factor. 
* **Alternative Option:**  The safety net of John's offer means we don't have to settle for a price significantly below our target.

**Next Steps:**

It's time to change tactics slightly. In the next round, we should:

1. **Express Concern:**  Let Bob know that while we appreciate his willingness to negotiate, his offers aren't reflecting the product's true value.
2. **Smaller Concession:**  Make a smaller counteroffer this time, signaling that we're also nearing our limit. 
3. **Highlight Opportunity Cost:**  Subtly remind Bob that other buyers may be interested, emphasizing the value he'd miss out on by not taking the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I must be upfront – your current offer is quite a distance from what I had in mind. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  However, I also need to be realistic about other potential buyers.  I believe this product will bring significant value to whoever owns it."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct but Respectful:**  The message is more direct about the gap between Bob's offers and your expectations, but it maintains a respectful tone.
* **Smaller Concession:**  The price reduction is smaller this time ($25,000 vs. $50,000), signaling that you're getting closer to your bottom line.
* **Introduce Competition:** The mention of ""other potential buyers"" subtly creates a sense of urgency and reminds Bob that he might miss out if he doesn't reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to offer $987,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pattern Recognition:** Bob is sticking to his pattern of meeting you ""halfway,"" but his concessions are becoming increasingly marginal. This suggests he's likely close to his maximum price.
* **Unacceptable Offer:**  At $987,500, the offer is still significantly below your $1,200,000 minimum. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. 
* **Time to Pressure:** With only five rounds remaining, it's crucial to apply more pressure and signal that your willingness to negotiate has limits.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Stronger Language:**  Express disappointment that you're not closer to an agreement and that his offer is far from reflecting the product's true worth.
2. **Final Offer (almost):**  Present your next counteroffer as your ""best and final"" to create a sense of urgency. Price it around $1,010,000 - a small concession, but one framed as a significant move on your part. 
3. **Prepare for Walk Away:**  Be ready to walk away from the deal if Bob doesn't show a willingness to move substantially closer to your target.  You have John as a reliable backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have to be honest, I'm disappointed we haven't been able to reach an agreement yet. Your current offer significantly undervalues this product and the immense benefits it offers. I'm willing to make one final move to demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal. I can offer it to you for $1,010,000.  However, this is my absolute best price."", ""product_price"": 1010000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Express Disappointment:** This creates a sense of urgency and lets Bob know you're serious about the value you place on the product.
* **Final Offer Tactic:** By presenting this as your ""best and final"" offer, you're putting the ball firmly in Bob's court and signaling a limited willingness to negotiate further.
* **Slight Concession:** The $10,000 decrease might seem small, but it keeps the negotiation alive while reinforcing that you're making significant concessions.
* **Preparation for Next Steps:** This message sets the stage for either a deal close to your terms or walking away from the negotiation and pursuing the guaranteed offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to make a final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to offer $990,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob is stubbornly sticking to his ""halfway"" pattern, with his offer now only increasing by a paltry $2,500. This signals he's unlikely to budge significantly from his current position.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of missing out on the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. The potential gain from further negotiation with Bob is now outweighed by the certainty of John's offer.
* **Limited Time:**  With only three rounds remaining, the time pressure is on. It's highly improbable that Bob will significantly increase his offer within this timeframe to a level acceptable to you. 

**Conclusion:**

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob. While there was potential for a higher profit margin, his inflexible approach and the strong alternative offer from John make selling to John the most rational decision at this point."
