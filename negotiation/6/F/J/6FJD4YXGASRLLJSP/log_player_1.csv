Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with a slightly lower offer ($1,350,000) allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate up, increasing your potential profit.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 with John gives you leverage in the negotiation.  You are not desperate to sell below that price. 

**The message is crafted to be:**

* **Direct:**  Clearly states the purpose and the offered price.
* **Respectful:** Acknowledges Bob's potential interest and invites his input.
* **Confident:** Implies the product's value without being overly aggressive."
