"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000, to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a fair starting point given the product's worth to me.  I'm confident I can get a good price, but I'm also prepared to walk away if necessary and sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a respectable offer, it's still below my desired price range.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price and I'm confident Bob will be willing to negotiate further. I'm not yet ready to settle for the $1,000,000 I could get from John, so I'm going to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,350,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  I believe this price is fair and competitive while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my desired price range. While I would prefer more, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal.  I'm also aware that I have limited rounds, so I'm going to accept this offer."
