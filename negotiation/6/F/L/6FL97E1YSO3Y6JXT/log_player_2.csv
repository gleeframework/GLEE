"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its value to you and still allows me to make a good profit. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiating practice to start with an offer significantly lower than your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate upward. 
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer, but clearly states that the price needs to come down.
* **Targeting a Good Deal:**  A price of $900,000 represents a significant saving for Bob while still allowing Alice to make a profit of $100,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still gives you a significant discount on the product's value to you. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate by meeting Alice halfway between their last two offers. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** While willing to compromise, Bob is still aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's starting offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By proposing a specific number and framing it as a fair deal, Bob is encouraging Alice to make a decision."
