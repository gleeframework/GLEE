"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its value to you and still allows me to make a good profit. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still gives you a significant discount on the product's value to you. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
