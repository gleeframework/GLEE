Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $149. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80, so I need to offer it at a price significantly lower than $150 to entice him.
* **John as Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John if Bob declines. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $149 leaves a small window for potential negotiation with Bob while still aiming for a price close to my minimum."
