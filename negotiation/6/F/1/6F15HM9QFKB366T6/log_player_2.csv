"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $900000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is my best and final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but $825,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay right now. He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
