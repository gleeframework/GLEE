"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is my best and final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $825000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $800000? I'm confident we can find common ground at that price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
