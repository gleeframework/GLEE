"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
