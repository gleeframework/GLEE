"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and the fact that I'm a serious buyer. Let's work together to find a solution.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm sure you'd agree.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?  This would allow both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $1,400,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  I'm eager to move forward with this purchase, so let's work together to find a solution.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
