"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your budget, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $13,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the product is worth $12,000 to me and it's a significant reduction from your initial offer.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll sell the product to you for $13,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,5,
