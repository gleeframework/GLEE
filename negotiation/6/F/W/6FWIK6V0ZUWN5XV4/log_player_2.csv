"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product. It's a game-changer in its industry and has a lot of potential for growth. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000. I think this is a great value considering its potential and the benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth paying $14,000 for the product.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value and potential. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $12,000 is better than $14,000, it's still above your budget.  Rejecting allows further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  My maximum budget for this product is $11,000. If you're able to come down to that price, I'm ready to buy."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $11500. This is the lowest I can go without compromising the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum.  Rejecting and counter-offering again gives you a better chance to get to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,500 is still a little out of my range. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident this product is worth that amount to me.  Let me know if you're agreeable."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're close to your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to give up on the value of this product just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $11200. This is a small compromise, but it's still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

While $11,200 is a better price than Alice's previous offer, it's still above your budget.  You've been through a lot of rounds of negotiation, and it seems like Alice is not willing to drop her price significantly further.  Given that you're getting close to your deadline and John is offering a guaranteed price within your budget, it's best to go with John."
