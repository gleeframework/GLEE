"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. I'm prepared to accept $1,150,000.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? That's a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to find a compromise.  While I value your perspective, $1,075,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offer, and propose $1,112,500. This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",1112500.0,Alice,5,
