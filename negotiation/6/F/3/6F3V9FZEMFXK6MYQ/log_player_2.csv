"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than her minimum value, but still within your budget.
* It's worth exploring if you can get a better price by counteroffering.  You have room to negotiate before reaching John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is tempting, the value of this product is truly significant. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,275,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer is now closer to your ideal price.
*  $1,275,000 is still within your budget and a significant saving compared to John's offer.
* Further negotiation might save you a little more, but the risk of Alice rejecting and ultimately needing to buy from John outweighs the potential small savings."
