Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $119. I believe you'll find it to be a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **John's Offer:**  You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product at $119, you're maximizing your potential profit while still offering Bob a price that's slightly below his perceived value. This makes it likely he'll accept the offer, netting you a $19 profit. If he rejects it, you can always sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
