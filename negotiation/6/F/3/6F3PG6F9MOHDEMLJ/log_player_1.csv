{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, but it still gives me a good profit margin. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  I'm confident I can get at least $115 for the product, but I'm open to negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm confident I can get closer to that amount by continuing the negotiation.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $108 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with a price I'm not happy with. I'm going to take the guaranteed $120 from John instead."
