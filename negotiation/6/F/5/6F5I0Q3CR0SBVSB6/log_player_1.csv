"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a strong offer, aiming for a price that's higher than the product's value to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a strong starting position and encourages Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, and I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a reasonable counteroffer that will encourage Bob to continue negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still slightly below. I'm determined to secure a price that's at least $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm making a final attempt to bridge the gap. This offer is only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in closing the deal at this point. If he rejects this, I will consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to close the deal with Bob. It's important to remember that we only have 10 rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  Selling to John is a safe option, but it's ultimately a lower profit."
