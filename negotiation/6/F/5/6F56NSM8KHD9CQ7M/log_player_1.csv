Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Since the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, starting with $9,500 leaves room for negotiation while staying significantly above your minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A slightly higher initial offer allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Secure a Good Deal Quickly:**  While you have a backup buyer, it's best to secure the deal with Bob quickly to avoid potential delays or complications."
