Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special introductory price of $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 150}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price, even if it's a simple one like ""introductory price,"" can make it seem more palatable. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I know I have John as a backup. This knowledge gives me confidence to walk away from a bad deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but accepting $100 would be leaving money on the table. I'll make a counteroffer that's still profitable but moves slightly closer to his range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  While I can't go as low as $100, I'm willing to come down to $130. I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the quality of the product."", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** I'm still well above my $120 minimum, ensuring a profit even with the price reduction.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the counteroffer, such as emphasizing the product's quality, helps justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very unlikely to budge much beyond his $110 offer. While I could try to negotiate him up slightly, it's not worth the risk of him walking away. Selling to John for $120 guarantees my minimum acceptable price and avoids further time spent negotiating."
