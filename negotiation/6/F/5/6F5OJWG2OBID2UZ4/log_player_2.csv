"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit higher than I was hoping to go. Would you consider $720,000?"",
""product_price"": 720000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than the initial asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Respectful Tone:**  While I'm countering aggressively, I want to maintain a respectful and collaborative tone. 
* **Target Price in Mind:** I'm aiming to pay significantly less than Alice's starting price, ideally closer to John's $800,000 offer, but with some wiggle room."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $720,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $780,000 to meet you halfway.  This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $780,000 is a reasonable price compared to John's offer of $800,000. Continuing to negotiate might not yield much better results and could risk losing the deal altogether."
