"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential counter-offer.
* **Ambitious but Not Outrageous:** While the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, aiming for $2,000,000 sets a strong initial point. Bob might be willing to negotiate within this range, especially if he perceives the product's value as closer to his own $1,000,000 valuation.
* **Leaving John as Backup:**  Remember, you always have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000. This knowledge gives you leverage in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a fairer agreement. Considering the current market conditions and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches John's standing offer of $1,500,000. While we could try to negotiate further with Bob, there's no guarantee he'll go higher. Accepting his offer or continuing negotiations risks getting a lower final price. 

Selling to John immediately secures the known value and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation rounds."
