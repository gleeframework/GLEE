Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to maximize my profit.  I know I can always fall back to John's offer of $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll try to squeeze out a bit more by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $17,000. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to a compromise and shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,500 is now very close to my ideal price. Accepting his offer ensures I get a better price than selling to John, and it minimizes the risk of further negotiation and potential failure."
