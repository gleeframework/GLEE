"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Bob is likely to counteroffer, and we can adjust our strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it just yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $140.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my original asking price. How about $135?  That's still a great deal for you, and leaves room for us to both be happy."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant at $135. I'm thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is a good compromise. It's close to my target price of $140, and it's significantly more than what John would pay. Accepting this offer ensures I maximize my profit without risking a further decrease in price or having to negotiate further."
