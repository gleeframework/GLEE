Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're already making a decent profit at this price.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This leaves room for negotiation and potentially getting a higher price.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It shows that you're serious about selling but aren't giving away the product for cheap.

Keep in mind, this is just the beginning.  You'll need to be ready to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob and what you initially offered. There's still room for negotiation to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  It's still a good deal for both of us, and we can finalize this quickly."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's a good idea to accept Bob's offer.  While you could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, the risk of losing the sale altogether and having to settle for John's lower offer is not worth it. You're still making a significant profit, and it's clear that Bob is unlikely to budge much further."
