"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $160. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $160 is still a little higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $140?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can make this work.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 was still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $155. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope it's something you'd be willing to consider.",155.0,Alice,5,
