Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think you're really interested in this product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $90, but I need to make a profit, so I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer.

**Reasoning:** Alice is unwilling to go below $90. While closer to my budget, I have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $80 from John. It makes more financial sense to go with the guaranteed lower price."
