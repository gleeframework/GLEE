"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 was a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $105.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal! However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $105. How about we compromise at $115? I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's still a great deal for you.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm happy to meet you at $110.  This is my final offer, and it's a great deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I've already made a concession to $115, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $112.50, but that's as low as I can go.",112.5,Alice,7,
