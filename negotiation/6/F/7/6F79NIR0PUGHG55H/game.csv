"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $4,500 is significantly below the product's value. It's worth considerably more to both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?",7000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I'm still trying to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $5,250? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not willing to go above that.",5250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $5,250 is still too low.  Let's settle on $6,500 and close the deal. This is a fair offer considering the product's true value.",6500.0,Alice,5,
