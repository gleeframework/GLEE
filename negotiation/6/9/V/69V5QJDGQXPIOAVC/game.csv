"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price considering the value it brings to your business.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $9,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,750 is still a bit lower than my target price. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $10,250. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value and my costs.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this simple: I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair offer, considering it's what the product is worth to you.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'll make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $10,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",10200.0,Alice,7,
