Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, bringing me closer to his maximum.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob rejects my offer, I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John. This knowledge gives me leverage to aim higher with Bob."
