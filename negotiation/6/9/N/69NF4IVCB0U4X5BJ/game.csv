"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in your product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, considering my budget and the value I see in it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. Considering our costs and the value proposition, we're unable to match your offer directly. We propose a price of $11,000 for the product. This allows us to maintain a reasonable margin while still being competitive. We look forward to your consideration.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500 for the product. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We understand your position and would like to present a counterproposal. We are willing to consider $10,800 as the final price for the product. This allows us to cover our costs and maintain a reasonable profit margin. We hope this aligns better with your expectations and budget.",10800.0,Alice,5,
