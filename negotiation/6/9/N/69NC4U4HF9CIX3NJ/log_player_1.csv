Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $10,000 as possible, but I also want to make sure Bob is likely to accept. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a strong initial offer, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially allowing me to still secure a deal above $9,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, so I'm not desperate. This offer balances the risk of losing Bob with the potential for higher profit."
