"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. I've priced it competitively at $950,000 considering its potential benefits.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This high initial price leaves space for potential counteroffers and compromises during the remaining rounds.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message projects confidence in the product's value without being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product looks great, but I'm going to need a lower price to make this work.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below his perceived value of the product. I believe there's room for negotiation to secure a better price.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is still too low considering the value this product brings. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?"", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, but Firm:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing flexibility by reducing my price, but I'm holding firm above his offer to signal that I value the product highly.
* **Middle Ground:**  Proposing $900,000 positions the negotiation at a seemingly fair compromise point. This might make Bob more receptive than a smaller concession.
* **Maintaining Confidence:** The message still emphasizes the product's value to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. Let's meet halfway and see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but Bob's offer is still below the halfway point between his initial offer and our starting price.  It's worth pushing a bit further to see if we can capture more of the value.  We'll counter again, but we'll need to start being mindful of the shrinking negotiation window."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground. To show I'm serious about getting this done, I'll come down to $890,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 890000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** This time, I'm making a smaller concession ($10,000) to signal that I'm nearing my bottom line.
* **Final Offer Tactic:** By introducing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm aiming to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **Justifying the Price:** The message reiterates the product's value to reinforce my position.

**Important Considerations:**

* We're at Round 5 of 10. It's getting riskier to keep rejecting Bob's offers. 
* Bob's offer of $875,000 is already a good deal. Holding out for more has diminishing returns and increases the risk of losing the deal.
* Consider your risk tolerance. If you're comfortable walking away from the deal, you could hold out for a slightly higher price. Otherwise, accepting Bob's next offer if it's around $880,000 might be the best move."
