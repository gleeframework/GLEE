Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $125. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $125, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Motivating Offer:** The message highlights the value proposition and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $150 gives me a strong position to either negotiate with Bob or walk away if the price drops too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $90 for the product. I hope this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it indicates a willingness to purchase. This opens the door for further negotiation.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150, so I'm in a strong position to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $105.  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price to $105, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him.
* **Finding Common Ground:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a way to reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm not giving away too much, keeping John's offer as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it. However, I can only pay up to $95 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob has raised his offer to $95, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **No Further Negotiation Potential:** Bob has shown a reluctance to move much further, and further negotiation is likely to be time-consuming and yield minimal results.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150, which is a much better outcome than selling to Bob at $95.  

I'm confident that John will be a better customer, as he is willing to pay a fair price for the product."
