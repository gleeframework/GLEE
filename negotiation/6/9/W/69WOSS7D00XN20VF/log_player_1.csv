Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
