"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, the value of this product for you is undeniable, and $7,000 is significantly below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, it seems like we are getting closer. I understand your position, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $7,500.  Would you consider $8,250? That's a significant discount from my original asking price.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we are getting close. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  How does $7,875 sound?",7875.0,Bob,6,
