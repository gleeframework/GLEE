Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, the value of this product for you is undeniable, and $7,000 is significantly below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, it seems like we are getting closer. I understand your position, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $7,500.  Would you consider $8,250? That's a significant discount from my original asking price."", ""product_price"": 8250}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we are getting close. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  How does $7,875 sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $8,000 threshold before time runs out or before his offers become too low. John offers a guaranteed $8,000, which is the minimum acceptable price. It makes sense to secure the sale at this point rather than risk a lower offer from Bob."
