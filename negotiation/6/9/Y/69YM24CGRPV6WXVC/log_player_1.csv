I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000.  This gives me a significant profit over selling to John, while still potentially being attractive to Bob if he values the product highly.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  I'm taking a calculated risk by aiming high.  If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.
* **Potential for Higher Gain:** There's a chance Bob values the product even more than $1,500,000, leading to a much larger profit.
* **Negotiation Space:** This offer leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters with a lower price. 

Let's see what Bob decides!"
