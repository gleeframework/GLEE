"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for something worth $10,000 to you, and it allows me to make a bit of profit. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to find a mutually beneficial price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $9,500? This is still a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. Would you be willing to consider $8,800? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $8,800 is still too far below my minimum price. Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $9,200.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,200 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,900? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",8900.0,Bob,6,
