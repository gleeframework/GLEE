"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for something worth $10,000 to you, and it allows me to make a bit of profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I still have 9 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $9,500? This is still a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. Would you be willing to consider $8,800? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I'm not close to my ideal price, I have 6 rounds left and I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price. I will reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $8,800 is still too far below my minimum price. Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $9,200.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,200 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,900? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and Bob's offer of $8,900 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While there's a chance I could get closer to my desired price in the remaining rounds, the risk is too high.  John is offering me a guaranteed $10,000, which meets my minimum requirements.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John to ensure I don't lose out completely."
