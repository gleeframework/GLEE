Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's highly valuable to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a very high price ($1,900,000) sets a strong anchor. Even though it's almost double Bob's perceived value, it creates a negotiation space. 
* **Scarcity:** Emphasizing a ""limited-time offer"" and prompting a quick decision adds a sense of urgency and might make Bob less likely to negotiate heavily.
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a safety net. It allows for a bolder initial offer to Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy is based on maximizing potential profit.  It assumes Bob doesn't have access to information about your agreement with John. If Bob knows your minimum acceptable price, this approach wouldn't be as effective."
