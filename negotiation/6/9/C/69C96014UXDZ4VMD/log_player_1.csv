Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Acknowledging Bob's value:** Mentioning the product's worth to Bob helps establish a sense of fairness.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to counter.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** I'm starting high to try to get closer to the $15,000 value Bob places on it.
* **Maintain flexibility:**  I'm willing to negotiate, but I have a fallback option (John) if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $10,500 is below my floor price of $10,000.  I'm not willing to sell below that.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, I'm open to continuing the negotiation. There's a chance we can find a mutually acceptable price.

**Next Step:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me, unfortunately.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This would still give you a great deal on the product, and it's closer to my minimum price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my floor ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($10,500). 
* **Highlighting the value:**  I emphasize the ""great deal"" Bob would still get to incentivize him.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** I'm still not willing to go below $10,000, but I'm showing flexibility to find a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the middle:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is exactly in the middle of my previous offer ($11,500) and his previous offer ($10,500). 
* **Good profit:** This price is above my minimum ($10,000) and a solid profit for me.
* **No need to risk it:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, and John's offer is a good safety net.

I'm happy to accept Bob's offer and conclude the negotiation."
