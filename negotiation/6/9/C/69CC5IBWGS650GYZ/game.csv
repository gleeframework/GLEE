"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is $8,000.  I'd be willing to buy it for that price if you're open to negotiating.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $8,000 is below what I had in mind, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is closer, it's still above what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a good compromise. Let's see if we can find a deal at that price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
