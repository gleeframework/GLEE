Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000 
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $500,000 (Bob's value - your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's closer to $1,500,000 without being so high that Bob would rather walk away. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Confident:** The message is straightforward and positions the product as valuable.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 leaves a significant portion of the potential profit margin on the table for you while still offering Bob a substantial discount compared to his perceived value.
* **No Room for Negotiation (Implied):**  While you can always negotiate if Bob pushes back, the initial offer implies a degree of firmness.

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This offer assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style. If you knew he was particularly aggressive, you might start higher.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower price for a more collaborative tone. 
* **Alternative Buyers:** While you have John as a backup, mentioning other interested parties (even if they don't exist) can sometimes add pressure.
