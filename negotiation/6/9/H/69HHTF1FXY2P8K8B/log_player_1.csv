Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Friendly Tone:** Keeping the message friendly and open to discussion can encourage Bob to negotiate rather than immediately rejecting. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps me gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Risk:** While $90 is less than my initial ask, it's still above my minimum of $80 and represents a good profit. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Further negotiation might drag on, and there's always a risk Bob could walk away or become less interested. 
* **Time Factor:**  Selling to John for $80 is an option, but accepting Bob's offer is quicker and secures a better price."
