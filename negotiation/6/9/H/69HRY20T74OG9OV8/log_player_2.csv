**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than my ideal price. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows me to see if Alice is willing to come down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $885000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is very close to my target price of $850,000.  With only 5 rounds left, there's a risk of not finding a better deal or even losing the opportunity altogether.  Accepting this offer allows me to purchase the product at a reasonable price and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
