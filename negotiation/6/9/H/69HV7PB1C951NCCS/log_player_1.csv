Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a deal if he counters. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly justifies the high price by mentioning ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""true worth.""
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains open and invites Bob to share his thoughts, encouraging him to counter-offer.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to find Bob's highest acceptable price. If he rejects $15,000, Alice can always come down in subsequent offers, knowing she has John as a backup at $10,000."
