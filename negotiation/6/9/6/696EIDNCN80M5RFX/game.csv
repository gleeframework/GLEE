"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is below its true value. How about we meet halfway at $1,000,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your perspective.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
