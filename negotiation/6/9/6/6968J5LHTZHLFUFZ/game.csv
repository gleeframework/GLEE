"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $85. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're not willing to go to $85.  Let's split the difference - I'll pay $95 for it.  This is still a good deal for you and a great deal for me.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, though. I can offer it to you for $110. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
