{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a much lower price than Alice's initial proposal. This counteroffer is a strong starting point for negotiation, pushing Alice to consider a substantial reduction. While it's a bold move, it might entice Alice to counter with a price closer to Bob's target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal. Buying from John at this point would be a missed opportunity to potentially get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while staying within his budget. This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise, suggesting a willingness to pay slightly more while still attempting to secure a better deal than Alice's last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now below Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, the potential savings are small, and there is a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers.  Accepting this offer is the most sensible decision as it allows Bob to secure the product while staying within his budget and minimizing the risk of a breakdown in negotiations."
