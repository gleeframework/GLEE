"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own a truly exceptional item. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its true value. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. I would like to propose an offer of $500000 to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $500000 is significantly lower than its value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1250000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and features.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $1250000 is beyond my budget. I would like to propose an offer of $750000. I hope this aligns better with the value you're seeking while staying within my financial limits.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $750000 is still below the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to the value of the product. I'm counteroffering at $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's features and value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I've carefully considered your proposal and would like to counter with an offer of $900000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget constraints. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $900000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value of the product. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm impressed by your persistence, Bob. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I'm getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I need to emphasize that this is my absolute final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options. I'm hoping we can close the deal at this point.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
