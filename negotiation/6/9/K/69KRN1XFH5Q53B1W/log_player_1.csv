Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I understand it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a competitive price.  Consider this a chance to secure a valuable asset for your business.  Please let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message is polite, highlights the value of the product to Bob, and sets the stage for a negotiation. It doesn't directly state a price, but subtly implies a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Product Price:**  I'm offering the product at $1,000,000, which is the minimum value for me. This ensures I at least break even, knowing I can sell to John if Bob rejects. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maintain my minimum profit:**  By offering the product at my minimum price, I'm guaranteed to make at least my target.
* **Open the door for negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a higher price. 
* **Leverage the backup option:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale with John provides me with negotiating power."
