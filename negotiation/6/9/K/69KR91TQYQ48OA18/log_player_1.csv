This offer starts the negotiation at a price point significantly higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. The message is friendly and engaging, encouraging Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $12,000 is above my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest!  I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. How about we go with $12750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still holding out for a price closer to $13,500. I'll counter his offer again."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,750 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product. How about we settle on $13,000? This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident you'd be happy with the value you'd be getting."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $12800, but I'm still not sure if that's the best price for me. Can you consider going any lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $12,800 is getting very close to my preferred range. I'm also not sure how much more room there is to negotiate, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. It's better to accept this offer and secure the sale."
