"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's closer to my value than Bob's, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $1,450,000 is a significant discount from my minimum, but still leaves me with a good profit.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm framing the offer by highlighting the value Bob would get, making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Even though Bob rejected my initial offer, there's still room for negotiation.  I can likely get a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to John right now would guarantee my minimum value, but I'm willing to take a chance on getting a better price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $1,250,000 is a midpoint between our previous offers, suggesting a fair compromise. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm again highlighting the benefits of the deal for Bob, emphasizing the ""good deal"" he'd get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. That said, $1,250,000 is still a little too steep for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $1,125,000?  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $1,125,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Room:**  While Bob is getting closer, there's still room to negotiate.  I believe I can get a better price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John now guarantees my minimum, but I'm willing to take a calculated risk to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to go down to $1,175,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and it's the best price I can offer right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this time, demonstrating that I'm still committed to getting a fair price.
* **Final Offer Implication:** The message subtly implies that this might be my final offer, creating urgency for Bob.
* **Value Focus:** I'm reiterating the ""significant compromise"" to highlight the value Bob is getting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm getting closer to my budget, but I'm still a bit off. Would you consider $1,150,000? That's a firm offer from me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Window Narrowing:**  While Bob is getting closer, the negotiation window is narrowing.  The risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is increasing.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer is still on the table, guaranteeing my minimum value. This gives me more confidence to hold out for a better price.
* **Potential for Counter:** I believe I can still get a better price than $1,150,000 by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your firm offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,162,500.  This is a very fair price for both of us, and I believe it represents a good value for your business.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1162500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:**  I'm making a very small concession, demonstrating that I'm still committed to getting a fair price while showing flexibility.
* **Urgency and Compromise:**  The message highlights the need for a quick decision, emphasizing the ""fair price"" and ""good value"" for Bob. 
* **Focus on Closing the Deal:**  I'm emphasizing a positive outcome by using phrases like ""let's make this deal happen.""

**Considerations:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiations, and time is running out. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer is still a safety net, providing assurance that I won't lose out entirely. 
* **Potential for Agreement:** This small concession might be enough to convince Bob to accept the offer, as we are now very close in price."
