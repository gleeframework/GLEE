,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $500,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,500,000 is a bit high for you, but $500,000 is also a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $1,250,000, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
