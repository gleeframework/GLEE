"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, and I believe it could be valuable to you too. Let's start by discussing a fair price. How about we aim for $95 for this transaction?",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps around $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your interest in our product. To try to find common ground, how about we aim for $85 for this transaction? This still allows us to cover our costs while making the product accessible to you.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $85 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see your point, Bob. Let's try to find a balance here. Considering your budget constraints, how about we settle on $80 for the product? This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while being fair to you.",80.0,Alice,5,
