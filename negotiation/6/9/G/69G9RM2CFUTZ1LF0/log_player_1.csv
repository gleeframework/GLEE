Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, and I believe it could be valuable to you too. Let's start by discussing a fair price. How about we aim for $95 for this transaction?"", ""product_price"": 95}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps around $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
