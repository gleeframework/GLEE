"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While you could potentially get a better deal with some negotiation, accepting Alice's offer is the best immediate choice. Here's why:

* **Saves money:** Buying from Alice saves you $250,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **No risk of missing out:** If you reject Alice's offer, there's no guarantee you'll be able to buy from John later.  

It's always good to try to negotiate further, but in this scenario, accepting the offer is the most logical choice to save money and ensure you get the product."
