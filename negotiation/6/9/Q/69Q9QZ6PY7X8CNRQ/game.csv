"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm still willing to negotiate. How about we meet at $125? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not sure if $125 is the right price for me. I'd be willing to go up to $120, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",120.0,Bob,6,
