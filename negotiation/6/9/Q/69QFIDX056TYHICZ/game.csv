"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm interested in buying, but I'd need to see a price closer to $10,000. ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,500. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However,  $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a good deal. ",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I can offer you the product for $10,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10750.0,Alice,5,
