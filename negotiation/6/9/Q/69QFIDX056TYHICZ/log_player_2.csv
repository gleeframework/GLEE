"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating. He's willing to pay up to $15,000, so there's room for a counteroffer.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm interested in buying, but I'd need to see a price closer to $10,000. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,500. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $11,500 is still higher than what Bob is comfortable with.  He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However,  $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I can offer you the product for $10,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his target price of $10,000. While $10,750 is a bit higher, it's a significant improvement from Alice's previous offers.  Since Bob has only 5 rounds left, it makes sense to accept this offer.  There's a risk that Alice might not budge further, and Bob could end up buying from John for $15,000.  It's a calculated risk, but accepting this offer is the most sensible choice at this point."
