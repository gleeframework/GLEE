Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

Round 6

While getting $15,000 from John is tempting, accepting Bob's offer of $14,000 makes the most sense at this stage.  Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $14,000 is a significant profit over Bob's perceived value of $10,000, and it's only slightly less than John's offer.
* **Negotiation Trend:** Bob is clearly interested and is steadily increasing his offer.  Holding out for more might backfire.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further extended negotiations."
