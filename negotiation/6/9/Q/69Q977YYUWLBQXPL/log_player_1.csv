{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000 is a reasonable starting point.** It's above Bob's valuation of $12,000, but still gives him some room to negotiate.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.**  It emphasizes the value of the product to Bob and leaves the door open for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest.**  If he immediately accepts, great! If not, it provides a starting point for negotiations.
* **Keep the option of selling to John open.** I'm not giving away the product for my minimum price just yet.

I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're putting on the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $12,500 is still below my minimum price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to sell the product for that amount yet.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. My goal is to get closer to my desired price, but I'll also be mindful of the risk of losing Bob as a buyer completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $12,500 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $13,500 to make this work.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $13,500, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a price close to my desired minimum.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. It also expresses a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to:

* **Test the waters:**  See if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By not immediately accepting Bob's offer, I'm showing him that I'm not desperate and have other options.
* **Stay within my minimum:**  $13,500 is still above my minimum of $15,000.

I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response to this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go right now. How about we split the difference and agree on $13,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my desired price.  While it's still below my minimum of $15,000, it's a reasonable compromise and a good deal for me. 

**Strategy:**

* **Close the deal:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a sale and avoid the risk of losing him entirely. 
* **Time is money:**  Further negotiation could take time, and I have the opportunity to sell to John for a higher price. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm maximizing my profits while minimizing the risk of a lengthy negotiation or losing a potential buyer."
