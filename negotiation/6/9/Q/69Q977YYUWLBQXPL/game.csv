"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're putting on the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $12,500 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $13,500 to make this work.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go right now. How about we split the difference and agree on $13,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
