"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget.  It's in your best interest to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time. This is my maximum, as I have other options available."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $10000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to your budget, but it's still too high. You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you at $12,000, which is closer to my budget and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not ready to go down to $12000 yet. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price.  You have several rounds left and can continue to negotiate. It's worth trying to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is a fair compromise and allows for a successful transaction for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not willing to go down to $12500. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13750. This is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than what you're willing to pay, and with only 3 rounds remaining, it's unlikely you'll be able to get a better deal with her. It's more advantageous to purchase from John for $10,000, saving you a considerable amount of money."
