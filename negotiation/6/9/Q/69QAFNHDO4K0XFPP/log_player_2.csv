# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is much higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. It makes the most sense to buy from John for $12,000."
