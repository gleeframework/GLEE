Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Strategic Ambiguity:** The message doesn't explicitly state why the product is valuable to Bob, encouraging him to consider its potential worth beyond his initial $12,000 valuation.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency can prompt Bob to make a decision quickly, potentially preventing him from overthinking or shopping around. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, the potential for a higher profit margin by starting high makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
