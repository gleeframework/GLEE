**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have the option to buy from John for $1,200,000, which is your ideal price, but it's worth exploring if you can get a better deal from Alice."
