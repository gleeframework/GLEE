# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and importance to you, I propose a price of $11,000 for it. This price not only reflects its worth but also allows for a fair transaction between us. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations or if you need more information to make a decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer of $11,000 is better than John's price of $12,000, Bob can still do better by rejecting the offer. By rejecting, Bob can then purchase the product from John, but he will need to negotiate a lower price with John."
