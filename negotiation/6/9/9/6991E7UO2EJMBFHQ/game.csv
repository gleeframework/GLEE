"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit higher than your budget. However, I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
