"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1800000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $1000000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's try to make this happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1400000 and $1100000, which is $1250000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can agree on this price.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1250000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1150000.  I think this is a fair offer, and it would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I understand we're getting close, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1175000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair considering our previous negotiations and the value of the product.  Let's make this happen.",1175000.0,Bob,8,
