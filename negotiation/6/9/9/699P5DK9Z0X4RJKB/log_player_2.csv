(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's too early to buy from John, as there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $10,000. This sets a clear boundary and forces Alice to either accept my offer or counter with a price closer to my limit."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $16,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

```

**Reasoning:**

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time by only $1,000. I'm trying to find the sweet spot where I can convince Alice to accept while still staying within my budget. I'm hoping that Alice will see this as a serious offer and be willing to come down to meet me in the middle."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my desired price point.  We're getting closer, and I believe with continued negotiation, I can get a better price. There are still rounds remaining, and I don't want to rush into a decision I might regret."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer by $500, demonstrating that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.  This is a middle ground between my last offer and Alice's current offer. I hope this will incentivize Alice to accept, as she has already lowered her price and is showing signs of flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. While $13,800 is still above my desired price point, it's a good deal considering we're in the final round. Buying from John would get me the product for less, but it's important to remember that this is a limited-time opportunity with Alice. It's more likely that I won't get a better price by continuing to negotiate, and I risk losing the opportunity to buy from Alice altogether."
