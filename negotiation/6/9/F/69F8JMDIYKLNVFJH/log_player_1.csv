I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $1,500,000. This gives me a good starting point and allows room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers.  I'm confident I can get a higher price than John's offer, so I'm willing to risk some back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

``` 

I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still a good amount above John's offer. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a better price.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to reach a compromise closer to my initial target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $1,150,000.  It's a smaller step down this time, showing I'm serious about making a deal with Bob. It's also just above John's offer, so I'm still in a strong position if Bob rejects this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, I've been through a few rounds of negotiations with Bob, and while he's moved closer to my price, we're still too far apart. It's becoming clear that we may not be able to agree on a mutually acceptable price. To avoid further haggling and ensure I don't lose out on a guaranteed sale, I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product for $1,200,000."
