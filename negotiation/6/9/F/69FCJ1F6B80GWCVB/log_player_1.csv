Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining or gives the impression of a better deal if Bob accepts right away.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** Offering the product at $130 is a price point that is hopefully attractive to Bob (as it's more than he values it) while still netting you a significant profit.
* **Considering the Alternative:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer at $150 provides a safety net. You don't need to go desperately low with your offer to Bob."
