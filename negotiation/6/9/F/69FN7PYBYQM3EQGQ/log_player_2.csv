"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $1,200,000, which is still too high for Bob. 
* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* It's better to reject the offer and make a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  This reflects the value I place on it while still leaving some room for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit, and $950,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you've placed on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $1,100,000, which is still higher than Bob's ideal price.
* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* It's better to reject the offer and continue negotiating to try and get a lower price.  There are still 7 rounds left, and Bob has time to see if Alice will come down further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm comfortable with a price of $1,000,000.  This offer reflects the value I place on the product while remaining fair to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting closer, Bob, but I still need to get a better price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. This is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on the product and the fact that I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $1,050,000, which is still slightly higher than Bob's ideal price of $1,000,000.
* While this is a good deal compared to buying from John, Bob still has time to negotiate.
