"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  This reflects the value I place on it while still leaving some room for negotiation.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit, and $950,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you've placed on it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm comfortable with a price of $1,000,000.  This offer reflects the value I place on the product while remaining fair to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting closer, Bob, but I still need to get a better price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. This is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on the product and the fact that I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a little higher than where I'm comfortable. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,000,000. This reflects a fair compromise between our two values for the product.  Let's finalize this deal and avoid the need for further negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
