"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $125 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price considering the product's value.  What do you say?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $135 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $130? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to purchase the product then.",130.0,Bob,4,
