While I'm getting closer to Bob's value, I'm still not satisfied with the offer.  I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate. I'm confident I can close a deal above my floor price of $1,200,000."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're still holding out for a higher price, but I'm getting close to my budget limit. I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll give you $1,050,000 for the product. This is as high as I can go.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting very close to my floor price, but I'm still not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000.  At this point, with only 4 rounds remaining, I'm going to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,200,000. It's a better outcome than settling for a lower price."
