"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $10,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire an item valued at $12,000 by you, at a competitive price. I look forward to hearing your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  He values the product at $12,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're offering, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a proposal that might work for both of us. How about we set the price at $9,500? This allows us to stay closer to your budget while still providing a reasonable profit for me. I hope this suggestion is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is within Bob's budget and a good compromise.  It's a better price than what John is offering, and it's likely that further negotiation won't get a significantly lower price.  Bob can save $2,500 compared to buying from John."
