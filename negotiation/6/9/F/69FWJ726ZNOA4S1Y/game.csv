"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality you mentioned, $200 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $150 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",150.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and I appreciate your interest in our product. In light of that, I am willing to negotiate the price down to $175. This still reflects the value of the product, but I hope it brings us closer to reaching an agreement that suits both of us.",175.0,Alice,3,
