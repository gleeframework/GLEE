"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $80, and Alice's offer is $120, it's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your maximum budget of $80.  Rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate is the best option to potentially reach a price you're comfortable with."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a little too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $80. It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept that."", ""product_price"": 80}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for 80. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I can offer it to you for 95. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

Alice has come down to $95, which is closer to your ideal price but still above your maximum budget of $80.  It's time to stop negotiating and take the guaranteed deal from John for $80. You've already tried negotiating, and it's clear Alice won't go lower than $95."
