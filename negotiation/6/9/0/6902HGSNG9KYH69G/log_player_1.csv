Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. I want to maximize my profits, but also want to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is a decent price, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is still a good deal for Bob as it's lower than his initial willingness to pay and higher than my minimum.  This should encourage him to accept, while also giving me a better profit than $85."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $87 is only slightly lower than my previous counteroffer of $90.  At this point, I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation and potentially losing the sale to John. $87 is still a good profit for me, exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $80."
