"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,000. Considering the value of the product to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $10,500. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable, and I hope you'll consider it.",10500.0,Alice,3,
