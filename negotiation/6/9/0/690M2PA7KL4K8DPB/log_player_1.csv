"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. My price is $110, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while also ensuring I don't immediately lose out on potential profit.  I'm also framing the message positively to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $100?  It's still a great deal for you and I'm sure you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95, which is closer to your last offer and still within my budget.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price and it seems like we are getting closer to an agreement. I'm willing to accept his offer to avoid the risk of losing the sale in the remaining rounds and the possibility of John buying the product."
