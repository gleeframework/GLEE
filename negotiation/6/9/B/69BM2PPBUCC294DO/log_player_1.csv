Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. After considering the value of the product, I'll offer it to him for:

{""product_price"": $15,000}

This is a competitive price, but I'm willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but it's still a reasonable offer. Since I don't want to lose the deal, I'll choose option (1) and accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
