"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm confident you'll find this to be a worthwhile investment.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $8,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll receive from the product.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet closer to the middle at $18,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your revised offer, but $18,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay within my budget of $8,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $12,500. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the value I'll receive from the product.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is my final offer, as it reflects the product's true value and represents a significant compromise on my end.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to stay within my budget of $8,000. I'm willing to offer $9,500. If this is still not acceptable, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John for $8,000.",9500.0,Bob,6,
