"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really value. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This will hopefully entice him to accept the offer, but also leave room for negotiation if he wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low right now.  How about $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to work with."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  Let's meet in the middle. How does $90 sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer of $80, and it's closer to what I want.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
