"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $8,000 is a good price, but Bob can potentially get it for even less. There's no reason to rush into a deal when he has more negotiating power."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This establishes that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and is willing to negotiate. It's important to note that this counteroffer is still within Bob's budget, so he's not risking anything by going low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, but it's still more than what he'd like to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob wants to see if he can get it lower. He's confident that he can get a better deal than $7,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing Alice that he's willing to compromise. However, he's still holding firm on a price lower than Alice's last offer. This demonstrates his commitment to getting a good deal without going over his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $7,200, which is within Bob's budget and a significant saving compared to John's price.  While Bob could continue to try to get it lower, the risk is that Alice might reject his next counteroffer and he might end up having to buy from John at a higher price.  At this point, it's more strategic to secure the deal at a price that's favorable to him."
