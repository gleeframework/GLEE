"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to establish a lower price point that is still fair to Alice. A $10,000 offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, leaving room for further negotiation if Alice rejects. This move also signals Bob's seriousness in making a deal while still keeping his maximum price point in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $10000 is closer to where we need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $11000.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for Bob. This price is within his budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.  While there's always the possibility of negotiating further, accepting this offer minimizes the risk of a breakdown in negotiations and ensures Bob gets the product at a favorable price."
