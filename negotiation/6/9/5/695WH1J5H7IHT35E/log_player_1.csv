Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think it would be perfect for you, and it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While I could start at $150, there's a chance Bob might accept a lower price.  $125 gives me a good profit margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price between Bob's perceived value ($100) and my minimum ($150) increases the likelihood of a successful sale.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 provides a safety net if Bob rejects my offer."
