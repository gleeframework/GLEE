"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  Since you value the product at $12,000, accepting her offer doesn't give you any savings. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Point:** Alice's offer is at your maximum value, so we need to start low. 
* **Reasonable Counter:** Offering $10,500 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Move:** This initial counteroffer shows Alice you're serious about negotiating and are willing to walk away if she's not willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your desired price point. 
* **Pushing for a Better Deal:**  Rejecting her offer shows you're not desperate and willing to continue negotiating.  
* **Potential Savings:**  You can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're slowly increasing our offer, showing Alice we're willing to compromise while still trying to get the best price.
* **Middle Ground:** $11,000 is a good middle ground between our previous offer and Alice's current offer.
* **Balancing Savings and Agreement:** This offer balances the need to save money with the need to potentially reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer is now very close to your desired price point, making it a good deal. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. 
* **Potential Loss:** If you continue to reject, you may end up having to buy from John at a higher price, missing out on potential savings. 

By accepting this offer, you're securing a reasonable price while minimizing the risk of losing out on a good deal."
