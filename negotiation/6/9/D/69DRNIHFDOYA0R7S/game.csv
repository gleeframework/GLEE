"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still leaves some room for me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $825,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, to $875,000. This price is still fair, given the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle at $850,000? It seems we're both eager to make a deal happen!",850000.0,Bob,6,
