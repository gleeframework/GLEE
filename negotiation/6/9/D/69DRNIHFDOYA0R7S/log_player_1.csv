Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy he's interested, $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still leaves some room for me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $825,000 is getting closer to what I want, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $825,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, to $875,000. This price is still fair, given the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle at $850,000? It seems we're both eager to make a deal happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. While I'm still hoping to get a higher price from Bob, it's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's a better deal for me to sell to John than to continue with Bob at this price."
