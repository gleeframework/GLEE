{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value but below your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** It avoids ambiguity and focuses on the price.
* **It includes a friendly message:** This can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive. 

By starting with this offer, you maximize your chances of getting a good price while also leaving room for a counter-offer from Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation. However, I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you be able to offer the product at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than Bob's initial value of $80, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to stay within your budget. I understand your offer but I can't go lower than $105. This is still a good deal for you, as it's less than what I would be getting from another buyer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see, Alice. Thank you for your clarification. Considering your offer, I believe I can agree to $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your target.  Rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer allows you to potentially get closer to your goal of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $100.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $102.50.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's still significantly less than I could get from another buyer.  Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 102.5}
