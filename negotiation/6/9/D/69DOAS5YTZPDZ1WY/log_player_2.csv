{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Save as much money as possible.

* **Counteroffer:** By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Strategy:**  Offer a price that's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within the range where a deal might be possible. This puts pressure on Alice to negotiate.
* **Rationale:**  Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum value of $12,000. This initial counteroffer is a good starting point for negotiation."

* **Counteroffer:** By rejecting again, Bob can attempt to secure a lower price, especially if he's willing to risk losing the deal."

{""product_price"": 9000}
```

* **Bob's Strategy:**  Increase the counteroffer to $9,000, which is closer to Alice's offer and within Bob's budget. 
* **Rationale:**  Bob wants to demonstrate his seriousness about buying the product, while still trying to get a better price. 
* **Negotiation Tactic:**  This counteroffer creates a sense of urgency for Alice, as Bob might be close to accepting the deal. It also signals to Alice that Bob is willing to meet her halfway."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $9,800 is only slightly lower than John's offer of $12,000, and it's very close to Bob's maximum budget. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  With only a few rounds left, the potential for further price reduction is minimal. The risk of continuing to negotiate is that Bob might lose the deal altogether.
* **Final Decision:** Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product within his budget, even if he doesn't achieve the best possible price.  It's a safe and practical option given the limited time and the small potential gains."
