"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's common in negotiation to start with a price higher than your minimum.  
* **Open to Negotiation:** Stating you're open to negotiation shows flexibility and encourages Bob to counteroffer.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message mentions the product is ""amazing"" and ""you'd be very interested in"". This subtly suggests its value without revealing your true minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.**  I need to get at least $15,000 for the product.
* **There are still rounds left:** I can counteroffer and try to bridge the gap with Bob.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  However, it's still early in the negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the value of the product, reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Setting a Limit:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob if I counteroffer. 
* **Limited Rounds:** While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I have a few rounds left to try and close the deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to go down to $15,500. This is my final offer, as I'm already below my desired price.  Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm stating this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency.
* **Close to Minimum:**  I'm only $500 above my minimum, showing that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Focusing on Closure:** The message emphasizes closing the deal to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Falling Short:**  Bob's offer of $13,500 is still below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiations, and I don't want to risk losing more time with Bob. 
* **Secure Option:**  John offers a guaranteed price of $15,000, which is more than Bob's latest offer and meets my minimum. It's a safe and reliable option."
