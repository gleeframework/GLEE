"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I see the value in this product, but your starting price is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product. I can do $1,250,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a firm offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
