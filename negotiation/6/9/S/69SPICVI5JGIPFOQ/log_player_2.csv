"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $90 is higher than Bob's maximum price of $80. Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. How about $75?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower offer, aiming to get a good starting point for negotiation.  $75 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $75 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $85.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $85 is getting closer to Bob's maximum, it's still above his target price of $80. There's room for further negotiation, and Bob has 7 rounds left to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $85 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?"", ""product_price"": 82.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground with Alice.  Offering $82.50 demonstrates willingness to compromise, but it still keeps the price lower than Alice's offer.  The hope is that Alice will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
