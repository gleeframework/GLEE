"Alice, your initial offer is quite high for my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000. This price reflects a fair value for the product based on my assessment. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a fair price, considering the value I'm offering.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1,300,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,400,000.  This price represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to come down. However, $1,400,000 is still slightly beyond my budget. I'm ready to pay $1,350,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise for both of us. This reflects a significant value for me, and I believe it allows us to reach an agreement.

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,350,000 still doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $1,450,000. This price represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us to reach an agreement.  Let's make this happen, Bob.",1450000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your final offer. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm ready to offer my final price of $1,375,000. This price is a true reflection of the value I see in the product and represents a significant investment for me. It's my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.
