"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is way below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need a fair price, Alice.  How about we settle on $70?  That's a reasonable compromise.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $70 is simply not enough.  Let's try $85. It's closer to my minimum, and it gives you a good deal. What do you say?",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really close.  I'm willing to go up to $75, but that's absolutely my final offer.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not comfortable selling for $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $80. It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal.",80.0,Alice,7,
