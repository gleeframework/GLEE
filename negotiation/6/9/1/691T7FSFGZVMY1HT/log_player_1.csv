"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm asking for $140 for it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I want to maximize my potential profit. $140 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation without immediately reaching John's offer. 
* **Friendly message:** A positive message helps build rapport and potentially encourages Bob to accept. 
* **Value proposition:**  Highlighting the value to Bob  (""I think you'd really appreciate its value"") may make him more likely to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $140 is a bit steep for me. How about $130? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:**  While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still above my minimum of $120, so it's worth continuing to negotiate. 
* **Room for counteroffer:**  I can likely get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. 
* **Early in the negotiation:**  It's only round 2, and I have 8 more rounds to explore better deals."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  A counteroffer of $135 is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still being close to my desired price. 
* **Positive message:**  Continuing to emphasize the value of the product can keep Bob motivated.
* **Still above my minimum:**  $135 is still above my minimum, so I'm not losing anything by continuing to negotiate."
