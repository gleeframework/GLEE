"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, so let me know your thoughts.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,100,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you coming closer to the asking price, but $1,100,000 is considerably below what I'm willing to accept for this product.  I'm confident this product can bring you a significant return, and to find a middle ground, I'm willing to drop the price to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the product's value.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1,450,000. I think this is a more reasonable compromise considering the product's value. Can we find a middle ground?",1450000.0,Bob,4,
