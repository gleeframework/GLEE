Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal and I think it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $14,000 is higher than Bob's value of $12,000, so he has some incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:** It's still above your minimum of $15,000, so you're not losing money.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's space to move on the price if Bob counteroffers. 

Keep in mind, this is just a starting point. The best offer depends on your assessment of Bob's willingness to pay and how much you value your time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I need to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
