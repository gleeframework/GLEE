"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I've done my research and I believe that's a fair price for this product. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1150000? This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident this product will be worth far more than that to you in the long run.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1150000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000. Can you meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,4,
