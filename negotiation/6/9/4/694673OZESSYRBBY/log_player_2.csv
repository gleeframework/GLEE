"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $14,000 to start negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer of $14,000 is significantly higher than both your maximum price ($10,000) and Alice's own valuation ($12,000).  There's significant room for negotiation. It's highly likely you can get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting with a much lower offer ($8,000) leaves room for negotiation while signaling your budget constraints. It's unlikely Alice will immediately accept, but it sets a strong anchor for the negotiation.
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on price.  Her response will give you valuable information for future rounds. 
* **Alternative Option:** You always have the option to buy from John at $10,000, so there's no pressure to settle for a price you're uncomfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your position, but $8,000 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice moved closer to your range, $11,000 is still above your maximum budget and you have a better alternative with John. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're serious about a lower price and are willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, $11,000 is pushing my budget. I can go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute limit."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** Increasing your offer to $9,000 shows willingness to compromise but keeps you within your budget.
* **Firm but Fair:** The message emphasizes this is your limit, creating a sense of urgency for Alice to decide.
* **John as Leverage:**  You still have the option to go with John, giving you leverage if Alice doesn't agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

**Reasoning:** Alice has met your maximum price.  There's no point in rejecting this offer and potentially losing the opportunity to buy the product at your target price.  It's a good deal!"
