"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $150. I'm hoping to leverage the fact that Bob is interested in the product and might be willing to pay a bit more than his perceived value of $120 to secure it.  I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I'm not going to give it away cheaply."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is better than my absolute minimum, it's still a little below what I'd like to get. I'm going to try to push for a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to counter with $155. This is a compromise, but it's still a little higher than Bob's last offer, and it's a bit closer to my desired price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, it's still a little below what I think I can get. I'm going to try to push for a bit more in the next round, keeping in mind that John is still an option if I can't reach an agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm going to counter with my absolute minimum, $150.  Since Bob has been steadily increasing his offers, I'm hoping he'll agree to this.  If not, I'm prepared to sell to John at this point, as it's a sure thing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to meet my minimum, and I've already reached my last possible counteroffer.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
