"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,000,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $850,000. Would that be feasible?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within the $850,000 range, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is my best offer at the moment, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting closer to a budget I'm comfortable with. How about $880,000? I'm hoping we can close the gap with this offer.",880000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000, but that's about as high as I can go.  Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $900,000, Bob. However, I'm still not at my target price. I'm willing to make one final offer to try to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is my absolute best price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",975000.0,Alice,9,
