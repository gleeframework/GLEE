Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $900,000, Bob. However, I'm still not at my target price. I'm willing to make one final offer to try to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is my absolute best price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

It's getting too risky now. Alice is clearly holding firm on getting a price above $950,000.  While we might squeeze out a slightly better deal in the last round, there's a chance Alice won't budge and we'll end up having to buy from John at $1,500,000.  Accepting $975,000 guarantees a good savings compared to John's offer."
