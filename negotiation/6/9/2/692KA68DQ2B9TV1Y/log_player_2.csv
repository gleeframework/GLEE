# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $1,200,000. This is a significant price reduction from the value it holds for me.  I believe this deal represents excellent value for you, considering the product's worth to you.  Please let me know your decision.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a lower price than Alice values the product, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  He can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, saving himself $200,000."
