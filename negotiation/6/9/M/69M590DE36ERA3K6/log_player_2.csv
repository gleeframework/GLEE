"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the value is even higher for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save even more. How about $10,000?  This still leaves us both with a decent profit, and allows for a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good profit.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$11,000 is a good price for Bob. It's lower than the initial offer and still leaves room for a profit. Going back and forth with counteroffers could potentially lead to a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal.  It's likely Alice is close to her bottom line, and accepting the offer is the most efficient way to get the product."
