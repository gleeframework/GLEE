"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product has potential, the price is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $1,750,000.  This is a very fair offer considering its potential.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need a price that works for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working to find common ground. While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $1,550,000.  This is my final offer.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
