"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly exceptional and offers immense value. Considering its worth to both of us, I propose a price of $9500. This allows you to acquire it at a slight premium over its cost to me while ensuring a fair profit for me. I believe this is a win-win situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're highlighting, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given its worth to me, I'd be willing to pay $8,500. This offers a decent profit for you while still giving me a good deal. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $9,000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit high. I'm firm on $8,750. This is a good middle ground that gives us both a decent profit. I'm confident we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 8750}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I've considered your proposal carefully, and I would like to offer $8900 for the product. This price ensures a satisfactory profit for me while remaining competitive for you. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, and $8,900 is a good price for Bob. It's only $400 more than his target of $8,500, and it's still cheaper than buying from John.  There's a risk of further negotiation, but Bob has already made significant progress and the time pressure is increasing. Accepting this offer is a good balance of risk and reward."
