"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the value I bring to the table.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value this product highly, and I'm willing to pay a fair price. However, $1,400,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000.  This demonstrates my serious interest, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price.  It shows me you're serious about this product. To be transparent, I have a hard minimum of $1,200,000 that I can accept.  This is non-negotiable. I'm willing to accept $1,200,000 â€“ it's a final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's final offer of $1,200,000 is still above his budget, and he has already reached his limit for negotiation. John offers a better deal at $800,000, aligning with Bob's budget and maximizing his savings."
