"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong anchor price significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and invites Bob's engagement, fostering a collaborative tone for the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Movement:** While the initial price is ambitious, it acknowledges that this is just the opening move in a multi-round negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,600,000 is well above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go above $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived value, which is significantly below my minimum. Accepting would be a substantial loss.  While selling to John is an option, I still have rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the value I bring to the table."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection & Justification:** I clearly signal that Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, explaining that it doesn't reflect the product's inherent value.
* **Significant but Gradual Concession:**  I've made a substantial reduction of $200,000 from my initial price, showing flexibility but not desperation.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value, subtly anchoring the negotiation around its worth rather than solely focusing on price.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** While I'm open to negotiation, the $1,400,000 counteroffer keeps me well above both Bob's offer and my minimum, leaving room for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value this product highly, and I'm willing to pay a fair price. However, $1,400,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000.  This demonstrates my serious interest, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer substantially, which shows he's serious.  However, $1,000,000 is still below my minimum of $1,200,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as there's a chance we can meet somewhere between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000. I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as I believe Bob might be persuaded to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price.  It shows me you're serious about this product. To be transparent, I have a hard minimum of $1,200,000 that I can accept.  This is non-negotiable. I'm willing to accept $1,200,000 â€“ it's a final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** I start by recognizing Bob's effort in increasing his offer, maintaining a positive tone.
* **Transparency and Firmness:** I introduce my absolute bottom line ($1,200,000) and clearly label it as non-negotiable. This sets a clear boundary for the remaining negotiation.
* **Final Offer Tactic:**  By framing this as my final offer, I'm encouraging Bob to make his final decision. It also adds a sense of urgency to the negotiation.
* **Aiming for a Swift Close:** While I have rounds remaining, securing the deal at my minimum now would be a success.  The longer the negotiation drags on, the risk of Bob walking away might increase."
