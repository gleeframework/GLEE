"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm happy to pay $110, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I really need to make a profit on this product. How about we compromise at $125? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price",125.0,Alice,5,
