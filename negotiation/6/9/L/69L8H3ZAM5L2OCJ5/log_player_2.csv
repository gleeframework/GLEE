Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $950,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal. If you're willing to agree to $875,000, we have an agreement. This is my absolute best offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price, and her offer of $875,000 is within your budget. While you could try to push for $800,000, there's a risk Alice will walk away. Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
