"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice's offer is too high.  Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,100,000 for this product. It's a fair price, given its value to me. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This allows us both to get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay, but we're getting closer! It's worth another round of counteroffers to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this work, I need to be at $1,200,000. This is my absolute minimum, and I believe it's still a fair price given the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has finally offered a price that aligns with your maximum budget. While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee of success, and you risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting the offer allows you to secure the product for a price you're comfortable with and avoids the risk of losing out to John."
