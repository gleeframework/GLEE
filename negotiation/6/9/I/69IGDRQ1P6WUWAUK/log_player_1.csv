Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below my minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting me closer to my desired profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, so I'm not desperate and can afford to aim high with Bob. 

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for a higher profit from Bob while still having the security of John's offer."
