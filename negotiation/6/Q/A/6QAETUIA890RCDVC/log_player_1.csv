Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I believe it's worth $900,000 to you. Let's start the conversation at that point."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I believe we can find a fair price for both of us. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's below my minimum desired value of $800,000. I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob or secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my assessment of the product's value, I would like to counter with a price of $825,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum desired value of $800,000.  It's likely I won't get a better offer from Bob, and it's not worth risking the deal to try and squeeze out an extra $25,000.  Accepting this offer is the best course of action at this stage."
