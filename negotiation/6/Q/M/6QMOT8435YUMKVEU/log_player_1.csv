{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This price reflects its value and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:** You're still getting a significant profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It sets a clear price point:** This allows Bob to easily understand your expectations."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is still a good profit for you, it's much closer to your minimum acceptable price than your initial offer.  It's worth trying to negotiate a bit higher. You can likely get closer to your ideal price of $1,450,000 by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I'd like to go. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $1,350,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows us to both get closer to our desired price points."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down a bit more, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,325,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is very close to your desired price of $1,350,000.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a better deal, but it also risks Bob walking away or your losing time.  Accepting this offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
