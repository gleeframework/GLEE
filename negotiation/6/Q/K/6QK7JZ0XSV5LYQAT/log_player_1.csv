Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $120 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate, keeping the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Avoiding Immediate Loss:**  This price is higher than John's offer, allowing me to potentially earn more while also keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Difference:** Bob's offer of $90 is still significantly less than the product's value to him ($150) and my minimum acceptable price ($80). This means there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially push for a higher price in the next round. 
* **Avoiding Immediate Loss:** While selling to John for $80 is an option, I'm aiming for a better deal. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation alive and gives me a chance to improve my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100. It's still a great deal considering the value this product offers you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $100 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his initial offer and my previous offer. This shows good faith and signals my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining a Profit Margin:** $100 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  My message reiterates the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefit he would receive from the purchase."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $95 is only $5 below my initial offer and is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob entirely, especially since he's already shown a willingness to walk away.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a profit of $15, which is better than the $80 I'd get from selling to John. 

While I'd ideally prefer a higher price, it's important to recognize that negotiation is a balance between achieving the best possible outcome and avoiding missed opportunities.  In this case, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most pragmatic decision."
