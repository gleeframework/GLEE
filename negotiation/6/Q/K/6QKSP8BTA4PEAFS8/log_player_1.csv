Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can come up with a fairer price for both of us. How about $120 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $140? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original proposal. How about we try $130 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's compromise at $135.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed with the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, I propose $130 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob. He's consistently offering lower than my minimum, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price."
