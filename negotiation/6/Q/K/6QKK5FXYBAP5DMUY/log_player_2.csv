"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a high-quality item that could greatly benefit your needs, valued at $12,000 by you. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than his desired price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  If unsuccessful, Bob can always buy from John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging my value for this product.  However, $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
