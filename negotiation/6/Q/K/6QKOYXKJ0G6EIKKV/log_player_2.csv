You should reject Alice's offer because it's above your maximum budget. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice, even if you end up buying from John as a last resort."

I'm offering $7,500 for the product. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and still leaves some room for negotiation."

Alice's offer is still above my budget, although closer to it. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."

I'm offering $7,800, which is closer to Alice's last offer and still within my budget.  This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but still hoping for a better price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is coming down in price, but I've already negotiated quite a bit and I'm not sure how much further she's willing to go. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John at $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
