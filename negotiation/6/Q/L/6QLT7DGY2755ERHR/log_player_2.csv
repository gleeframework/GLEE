"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000. This is a competitive price, considering its value and rarity. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is very close to my maximum price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, I can attempt to get a better price. I'm not in a rush and can afford to play the negotiation game."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm intrigued by the product, but I'm hoping to get it for a slightly lower price.  Considering the market and my budget, I'm willing to offer $950,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price but still represents a fair value for me. I'm aiming for a deal that is beneficial for both of us.  By expressing my willingness to negotiate, I hope to initiate a constructive dialogue and potentially secure a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, considering the product's value and rarity, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975000. This is a fair price, taking into account the market and the product's unique features. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met me halfway, and $975,000 is a price I am comfortable with.  I'm close to my limit, and I'm confident that continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a price I'm not willing to pay, especially considering John's offer. It's better to secure a fair price now than risk losing the product altogether."
