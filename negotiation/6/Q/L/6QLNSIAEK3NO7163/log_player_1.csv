"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,000. It's a fair price that considers the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John for my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $9,500? This would give you a good price and ensure we both come away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be frank, $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $8,250? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,250 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get him to come up a little more. Selling to John would be a safe option, but I'm not ready to give up on this deal yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,250 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $9,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to increase my offer to $8,500.  That reflects a serious commitment on my end, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I believe Bob is willing to go a little higher, and I'm not ready to settle yet.  I want to try to get closer to my target of $9,000 in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,500 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my ideal price. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,750? I'm confident this is a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
