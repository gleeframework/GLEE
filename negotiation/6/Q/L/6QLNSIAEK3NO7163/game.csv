"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,000. It's a fair price that considers the value I see in it.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $9,500? This would give you a good price and ensure we both come away satisfied.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be frank, $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $8,250? That feels like a fair compromise.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,250 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $9,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would allow us to close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to increase my offer to $8,500.  That reflects a serious commitment on my end, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal at this price.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,500 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my ideal price. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,750? I'm confident this is a fair price that works for both of us.",8750.0,Alice,7,
