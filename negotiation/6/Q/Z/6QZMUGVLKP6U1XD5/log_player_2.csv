(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $600,000 is a significant amount of money, and there's a good chance you can negotiate a lower price. It's also worth exploring how much Alice values the product before committing to a purchase."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially reveal how much she values the product.  It's a bold move, but if Alice is truly motivated to sell, she might consider it."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $500,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, I'm still aiming for a better deal. Alice has already shown some flexibility, and there's a good chance we can reach a lower price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us.  A middle ground between my previous offer and her current offer could be a good starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $550,000 is getting closer to what I'm willing to pay, I'm still holding out for a lower price. Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and I believe there's still room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm now meeting Alice halfway between her last offer and my last offer. This shows a commitment to reaching an agreement and demonstrates a willingness to compromise.  At this point, I'm getting closer to my maximum price, but I'm still hopeful that we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer has gone back up to her initial price of $600,000. This suggests she is not willing to budge further. At this point, I've already invested several rounds of negotiation and the price isn't getting any lower.  Given the limited number of rounds remaining, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $1,000,000 rather than risk being stuck with a higher price."
