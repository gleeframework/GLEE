Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit. If he rejects, I'll see how low he's willing to go before potentially selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000, so I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum price but gives Bob some room to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is now at my minimum price, so I'll accept it and sell the product to him.  This is a good outcome as I'm getting my minimum desired price."
