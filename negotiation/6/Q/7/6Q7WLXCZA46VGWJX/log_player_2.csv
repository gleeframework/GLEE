"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is still within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to negotiate lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm looking to spend closer to $105. Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $105, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. How about we say $110.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $110.50 is still more than Bob's ideal price. Bob is willing to negotiate further and see if he can get the price closer to $105."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price. How about $108? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $112? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the price lower. While $112 is getting closer to his target, he's not quite ready to accept yet. He's willing to counteroffer again to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still looking to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to make one last concession. How about we meet at $112.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $112.50 is still higher than Bob's ideal price. While Bob is willing to negotiate, he's also aware that he has limited rounds and a backup option with John. With only three rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice is increasing. It's more prudent for Bob to secure the product from John at $120, ensuring he gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation uncertainty."
