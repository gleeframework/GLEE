"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for my business, but  $1,350,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm eager to work with you, $1,000,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000 to bridge the gap. This price still allows me to cover my costs and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that benefits us both. ",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,150,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. Could we agree on $1,075,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,112,500? This price is closer to your offer while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits us both.",1112500.0,Alice,5,
