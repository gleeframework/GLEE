Alice's offer:

I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000 to bridge the gap. This price still allows me to cover my costs and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that benefits us both.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,112,500? This price is closer to your offer while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,112,500.

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's consistently meeting in the middle.  At this point, the difference between her offer and John's price is small enough that it's not worth risking further negotiation.  $1,112,500 is a reasonable compromise."
