"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on the price. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $9,200. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $12,000.",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your price is closer, I'm still a bit high.  I'm prepared to pay $8,750.  This is a fair price for us both, as it's a significant discount for me and still above your value for the product.  Let's finalize this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering you the product for $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,
