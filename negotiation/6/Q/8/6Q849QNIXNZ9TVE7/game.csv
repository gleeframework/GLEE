"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While the product is good, $1,100,000 is still a little steep for me.  How about we settle at $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
