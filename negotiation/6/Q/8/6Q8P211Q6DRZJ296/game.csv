"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000? I think that's a fair starting point for further negotiation.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $750,000? This offer demonstrates my serious interest in the product while acknowledging the value you deserve.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go below $800,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering it to you for $825,000. This is my final offer.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're tough! I respect that.  Tell you what, let's split the difference.  I'll do $800,000 even. That's my final offer. ",800000.0,Bob,6,
