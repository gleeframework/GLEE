"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $18000 is a bit steep for me. While I appreciate the unique value of this product, I'm only willing to pay $10000.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $14000. This is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
