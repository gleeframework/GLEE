I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120.,120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $70 for it. Let me know what you think.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100, but I'm still not quite there. How about $85? That's a fair compromise for both of us, and it would be a great deal for me.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $110. This is my final offer, so let me know if it's acceptable to you.",110.0,Alice,5,
