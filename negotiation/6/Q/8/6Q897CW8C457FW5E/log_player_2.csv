"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is asking for $120. This is way too much, so it's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $70 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 70}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$100 is still too high for you, even though it's closer to your ideal price. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100, but I'm still not quite there. How about $85? That's a fair compromise for both of us, and it would be a great deal for me."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $110. This is my final offer, so let me know if it's acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer of $110 is still too high for you. You're willing to pay a maximum of $80 for the product, and you know John is selling it for that price.  It's better to go with John's offer and avoid further negotiation."
