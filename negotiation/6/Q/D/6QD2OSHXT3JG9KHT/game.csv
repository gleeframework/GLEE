"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value our potential partnership, $8,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows you to stay within a reasonable budget.  Let me know your thoughts.",10000.0,Alice,3,
