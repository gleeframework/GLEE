{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm happy to offer it at a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob allows us to potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a significant profit margin for Alice while still presenting a compelling offer to Bob. He gains a $400,000 advantage over the product's worth to him.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
