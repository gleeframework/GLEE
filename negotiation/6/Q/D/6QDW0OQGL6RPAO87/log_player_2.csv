"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  Since Bob has a clear alternative of buying from John for $1,000,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's first offer.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm hoping to find a price closer to my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to be aggressive here, but still within a reasonable range.  He's offering a price significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still well above his alternative option with John.  This puts the pressure on Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is my best compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than Bob's alternative option of buying from John for $1,000,000. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to drive the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but he's still trying to get a better deal than his alternative. He's offering a price that's reasonable, but still a significant discount from Alice's latest offer. He's also positioning this as his final offer, putting the pressure on Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,075,000 is still higher than Bob's alternative of buying from John for $1,000,000.  At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice.  Bob should stick to his original plan and buy from John."
