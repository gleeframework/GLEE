"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $110 for it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is slightly higher than Bob's valuation, but leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'm confident I can get a better price through negotiation, so I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $100. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure if it's a good deal for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my minimum valuation of $120, and we're already in round 4. While I'd prefer a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely and having to sell to John for $120. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and secures a profit, although it's a smaller one than I initially hoped for."
