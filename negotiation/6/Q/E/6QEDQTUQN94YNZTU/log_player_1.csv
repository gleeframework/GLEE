"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price a bit higher than my minimum. This allows for some negotiation room while still ensuring I get a good price. I'm also keeping the message friendly and open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $175 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer, but $60 is really too low. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to $120. This is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm also highlighting the product's value to Bob to make my offer seem more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still far too low for me. I need to keep trying to get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my desired price range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is just not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would be a shame to miss out on this opportunity. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering $100. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but it also keeps the price significantly higher than Bob's last offer. I'm also reminding Bob that we both have a lot to gain from a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $80? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, we are nearing the end of the rounds and I risk getting a worse deal or running out of time. Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum desired profit and secures the deal."
