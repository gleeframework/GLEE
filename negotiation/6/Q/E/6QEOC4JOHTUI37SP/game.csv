"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand where you're coming from, but $16,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $18,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16,000 and $18,000. How about we try $17,000? Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",17000.0,Bob,4,
