"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,275,000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
