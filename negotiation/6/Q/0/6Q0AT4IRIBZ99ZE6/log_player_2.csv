"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to her ($1,300,000 vs $1,200,000), but still above your maximum budget.  It's worth negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,275,000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is still within my budget and is a good compromise.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and ultimately buying from John for a higher price is not worth it. This deal is a good outcome."
