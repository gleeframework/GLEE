,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle at $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $200 and $150, so I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to meet in the middle, but $175 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $160, but that's the highest I can go. Can you consider that?",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $175 was still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession to get closer to your target price. I'm offering the product to you for $170. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",170.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $170 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $155, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",155.0,Bob,6,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $165 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $155, but I'm starting to think that buying from John for $100 might be a better option for me. Can you meet me at $155 or lower?",155.0,Bob,8,
