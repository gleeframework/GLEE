"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $700,000 would be a good starting point.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand we're both trying to get a fair deal here.  How about we split the difference closer to your last offer, say $800,000? That feels like a good compromise to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,
