Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $165 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. How about we try $155? It's a compromise that still gives me a good profit, and I think you'll be happy with the price.

Alice is unlikely to go below $155, and it's not worth another round of haggling for a $5 difference.  Buying from John guarantees the $150 price."
