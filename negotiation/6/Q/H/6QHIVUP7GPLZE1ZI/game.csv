"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I know will be highly valuable to your business. I've carefully considered its worth and am proposing a price of $1,200,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your consideration of my business needs. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This represents a significant value for me while still allowing you a good return on your investment. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. While $950,000 is certainly a step in the right direction, it's still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still provides you with significant value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate further. $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product.  This price represents a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve our goals. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
