"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let's work together to make this happen.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true worth. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident that $825000 is a fair price for both of us. This offer reflects the value we both recognize in the product, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $825050. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",825050.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $825050 is close, I'm still hoping for a final adjustment to reach an agreement.  I'm confident that $825000 is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's close this deal and make this happen.",825000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $825000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825025. This is a very small increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's the best compromise we can reach. Let's see if we can finally come to an agreement.",825025.0,Alice,7,
