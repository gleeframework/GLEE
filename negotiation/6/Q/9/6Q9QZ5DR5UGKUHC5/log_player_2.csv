# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a great starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to quickly get a better price.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident that $825,000 is a fair price for both of us. This offer reflects the value we both recognize in the product, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**
