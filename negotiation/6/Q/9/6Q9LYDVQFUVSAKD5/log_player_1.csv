Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a reasonable starting price:** It's higher than your minimum, giving you room to negotiate. 
* **It's clear and direct:** It clearly states the price and invites Bob to respond.
* **It shows confidence:**  A bold opening price can make Bob think the product is valuable.

Remember,  you can always adjust this price based on Bob's reaction and the information you gain during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $80 is just too low for me. How about $90? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about $85? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really think that's the most I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is still below your ideal price, it's a decent compromise and is only $5 less than what you'd get from John.  The risk of further negotiation could lead to a lower price, or a stalemate. It's better to take the offer and secure the sale."
