Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product at a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding our minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring a profit if he accepts outright.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale to John at $120, so there's no risk of losing the sale entirely."
