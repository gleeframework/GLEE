Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000. Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification for Value:**  While not explicitly stating what the product is, the message hints at its significant value and potential to exceed Bob's expectations, justifying the high price. 
* **Direct and Confident:** The tone is direct, confident, and emphasizes the exclusivity of the offer, which can be persuasive.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he rejects the initial price. Your goal is to maximize your profit, but pushing too high might lead Bob to walk away, leaving you with the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
