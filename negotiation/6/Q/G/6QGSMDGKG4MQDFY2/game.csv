"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I do like the product, that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but $600,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer! However, $700,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
