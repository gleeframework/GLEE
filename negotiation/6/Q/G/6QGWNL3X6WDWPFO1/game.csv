"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a profit. Let's try to find a compromise here.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not comfortable with $1350000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1300000?  This would allow us both to get a good deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
