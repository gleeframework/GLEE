"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that is significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob, but still higher than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $85 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is above my minimum acceptable price of $80 and also closer to my initial asking price. It's a good compromise and I'm happy to accept it."
