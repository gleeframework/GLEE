,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is too low for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? It's a fair price that reflects the true value.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $18,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  How about $12,000?  I'm hopeful we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've received a compelling offer from another buyer. I can let go of the product for $16,000, but this is my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
