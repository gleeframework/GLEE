"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000. This is a fair price, and it's the most I can offer. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is the most you can offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product will bring to your business.",11250.0,Alice,5,
