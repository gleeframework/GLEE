"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  Given the substantial value of this product to you,  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price is still very fair considering its worth to you and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1,225,000.  This price is fair considering the value of this product to you, and it gets us closer to finalizing this deal.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
