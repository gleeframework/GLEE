Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, giving us significant room to negotiate above our minimum price.
* **Our Minimum:** We're guaranteed $8,000 from John, so any offer to Bob needs to exceed this.
* **Targeting High:** Starting with a strong offer of $12,000 aims to capture a larger portion of the potential profit. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While we have John as a backup, securing a deal with Bob at a higher price is the primary goal."
