"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000, which reflects the significant value it offers. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it offers.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $6,500 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This reflects the quality and potential it holds.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7,500, but that's the highest I can go. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it offers.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $7,500 is still too low for me.  How about we settle at $8,500?  That's my final offer.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're close, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and my previous offer of $7,500, which would be $8,000. I think that's a fair price for the product.",8000.0,Bob,6,
