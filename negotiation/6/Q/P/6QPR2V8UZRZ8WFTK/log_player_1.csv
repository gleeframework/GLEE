Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do this at $700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $700,000 is better than nothing, I can still potentially get closer to my desired price of $800,000. I'll try to counteroffer him and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal and closer to my desired price than John's offer. It's important to remember that a deal is better than no deal at all, especially when I'm at risk of losing out on a substantial profit."
