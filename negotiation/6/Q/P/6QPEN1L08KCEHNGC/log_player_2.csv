{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He is willing to pay a maximum of $10,000, and Alice's offer is $2,000 more than that. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, my budget for this purchase is $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $11000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he's still over his limit. There's still a chance to negotiate further and get the price down to his desired $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm happy to pay $10,500, which is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I can do $11200, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget, and he's already rejected her previous offer.  There's a risk that further negotiations with Alice might take longer and still not result in a price that Bob is comfortable with. Since he has a guaranteed option with John at his desired price, it's the most sensible choice to avoid further negotiation and secure the product."
