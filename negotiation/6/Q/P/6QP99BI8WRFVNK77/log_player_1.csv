Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'm offering $1,175,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still need to save some money. I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting late in the negotiation and Bob's offers are still too low. I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with an even lower offer."
