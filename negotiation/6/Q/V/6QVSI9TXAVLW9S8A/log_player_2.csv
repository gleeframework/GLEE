Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not comfortable going down to $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,750. This is the lowest price I can accept for this product.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not comfortable going below $10,500. This is the lowest price I can accept for this product, considering its unique features and value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice seems firm at $10,500 and has moved further away from our last offer.  It's unlikely we'll get a better deal than John's $10,000 offer at this point. It's time to cut our losses and buy from John."
