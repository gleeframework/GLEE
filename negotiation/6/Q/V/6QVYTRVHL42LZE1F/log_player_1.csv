"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than our minimum ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:** The message is designed to be open-ended, inviting Bob's feedback and gauging his initial reaction to the price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  While we have the John backup offer, we don't mention it yet.  Revealing it early could weaken our position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe $1,000,000 would be a fair price for me to purchase it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than our target and still leaves a substantial gap from our minimum acceptable price. While selling to John is an option, we have room to negotiate and aim for a better outcome with Bob. We will use the next round to counter with a price closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to $1,200,000 reflects that. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** We're moving closer to the middle ground between our initial offer ($1,300,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($1,000,000). 
* **Highlighting Value:**  We reiterate the product's value to justify the higher price, reminding Bob of its benefits.
* **Open Communication:** We maintain a collaborative tone, asking for his thoughts to encourage continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I am willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to our range, but there's still room for negotiation. While $1,100,000 is a tempting offer, we believe we can secure a higher price, especially since we have several rounds and the John backup offer. We'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $1,150,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation.  How about we find a middle ground?  Would you be willing to consider $1,150,000 for the product?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We are suggesting a price that splits the difference between his latest offer ($1,100,000) and our previous counteroffer ($1,200,000). 
* **Finding Common Ground:** The message emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable solution, showing flexibility while still pursuing a higher profit.
* **Simplified Proposal:**  We streamline the message to focus on the proposed price, prompting a clear response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Alice. Based on our previous discussions, I'd like to propose $1,125,000 as a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is a significant profit above our minimum ($800,000).
* **Reaching a Limit:**  We've been negotiating steadily, and Bob's counteroffers are getting smaller. It's unlikely he'll go much higher. 
* **Time Value:**  While we have rounds remaining, closing the deal now provides certainty and avoids the risk of Bob reducing his offer or us misjudging the negotiation."
