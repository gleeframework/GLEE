"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm for the product.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
