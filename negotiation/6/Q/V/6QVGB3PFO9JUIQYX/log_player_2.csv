"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a good starting point, I'm aiming to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $105. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial price of $115, but it's still within my budget and potentially a good starting point for negotiation. I believe Alice is likely to accept this offer, as it's still above her desired selling price of $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $115 to $110, but I'm still aiming for a better deal. I'll reject her offer and counteroffer again, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $108.  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and this offer is closer to her likely minimum while still being within my budget. I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $109, which is very close to my desired price range.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will be difficult and time-consuming, potentially leading to a worse outcome or running out of rounds. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product for a good price and avoids the risk of ending up with a worse deal or having to buy from John at a higher price."
