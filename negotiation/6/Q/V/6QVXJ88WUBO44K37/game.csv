"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $20,000 for it. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $20,000 is already a very competitive price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go higher than $12,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing you're serious about this product.  Let's make this work.  $14,500 and we have a deal.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement there.",13000.0,Bob,6,
