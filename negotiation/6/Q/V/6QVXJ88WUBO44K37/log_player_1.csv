Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go higher than $12,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.

Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  It's unlikely he'll reach $15,000. John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which meets my needs. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the sure sale."
