Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying above your minimum price.
* **Urgency:**  Adding a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially avoid losing out on a deal he values.

**Why this strategy works:**

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring the sale. It leverages Bob's higher valuation while still providing you with a significant profit margin above your minimum acceptable price."
