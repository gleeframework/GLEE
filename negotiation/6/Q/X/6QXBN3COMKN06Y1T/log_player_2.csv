Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I see the potential in this product, your price is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $950000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget, but it's getting closer. It's worth continuing to negotiate. You can try to push for a lower price and see if Alice is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. Given my  maximum budget, I can offer $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $900000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. This is my final offer on the lower end, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. Even though she says it's her final offer, there's no guarantee that she won't come down further. However, you've already been through several rounds of negotiation, and it's getting close to the end. It's not clear if you can get Alice to drop her price enough to make it worthwhile.  

Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $800,000, it makes more sense to go ahead with that deal to avoid the risk of further negotiations and potentially failing to close a deal."
