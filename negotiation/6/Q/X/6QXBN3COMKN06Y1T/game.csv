"Alice, while I see the potential in this product, your price is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $700000, considering my budget and the need to secure a good return on investment.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $950000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and potential. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. Given my  maximum budget, I can offer $850000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $900000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. This is my final offer on the lower end, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
