Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $120. I believe it's a great deal, given its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $120, we are ""anchoring"" the negotiation at a higher point. While Bob knows his value is $80, this starting price might influence him to counteroffer closer to our desired range. 
* **Leaving Room for Concessions:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, we have space to come down in price and still make a profit. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while also acknowledging the possibility of negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below both our minimum price ($80) and his own stated value ($80). Accepting would mean a loss.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, his message suggests a willingness to negotiate (""meet in the middle""). Rejecting opens the door for counteroffers. 
* **John as Backup:** We still have the safety net of selling to John for $80 if negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $60 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet halfway between my original price and your offer, at $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Concession):**  By proposing $90, we're demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to compromise. This approach can encourage Bob to reciprocate. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** The $90 price point is still above our minimum ($80) ensuring a profit if accepted. 
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:** We haven't dropped to Bob's initial low offer, signaling that we value the product and are seeking a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Marginal Gain vs. Risk:** While Bob increased his offer to $70, it's still only a $10 difference from John's guaranteed $80. Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of:
    * Him not budging further 
    * Prolonged negotiation with no guarantee of a significantly better outcome

* **Time Value:** Time spent negotiating with Bob could be spent finding other potential buyers who might offer even more than John.

* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John provides an immediate and guaranteed $80 profit, which is our minimum acceptable price. 

In this scenario, the marginal potential gain from continuing with Bob isn't worth the risk compared to the guaranteed and immediate profit from John."
