Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,450,000."", ""product_price"": 1450000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to start negotiations higher than your desired selling point. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** The initial price is above Bob's perceived value, but not drastically so. This might pique his interest while leaving room for him to counter-offer.
* **John as Leverage:** You have a strong alternative with John, ensuring you won't be pressured into accepting a deal below your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, your initial asking price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum price and what you can get from John. While his counter-offer was expected, it's important to show you won't settle for such a low price. Rejecting this offer allows you to guide the negotiation towards a more reasonable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposal. I'm willing to continue discussions, but I can't entertain offers below $1,300,000."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Step Down, But Above Bob's Value:**  This counter-offer shows flexibility but remains firm. It acknowledges Bob's interest while still aiming for a price above his perceived value.
* **Close to John's Offer:** This counter-offer keeps the price within a reasonable range of John's standing offer, preserving your strong alternative. 
* **Sets a Negotiating Line:** This firmly establishes a floor for future offers, signaling to Bob that significant movement is required to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the clarification on your position. While $1,300,000 is still above my initial target, I am seeing the value in this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:**  Bob offering $1,050,000 shows he's willing to pay a premium over his perceived value, indicating strong interest.
* **Close Enough to Your Minimum:** While not your ideal price, $1,050,000 is only $150,000 less than John's offer.  
* **Risk of Pushing Further:**  Continuing to push might alienate Bob, leading him to walk away. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing him entirely."
