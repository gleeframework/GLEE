"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000.  This is a strong opening offer that reflects the product's high value to me. It also gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters.  If he rejects this, I'll see where he's coming from and make a more informed decision for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is my floor, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. Bob's lowball offer shows he's trying to get a great deal, but I have more room to negotiate. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's lowball counter. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still believe the product is worth more than his initial offer. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price for Bob, but I'm prepared to keep negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up a bit, and while I would still prefer to get closer to my ideal price, accepting $1,100,000 is a good deal. It's significantly more than John's offer and is within a reasonable range considering the previous offers.  I'm confident I can make this work."
