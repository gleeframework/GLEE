"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering your valuation and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $9,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still stuck at $8,500. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  I'm still willing to make one last concession, but I need at least $8,800. If you're not willing to go that high, I'll have to explore other options.",8800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $8,800 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $8,600. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best option for both of us.",8600.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,600 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,700, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",8700.0,Alice,7,
