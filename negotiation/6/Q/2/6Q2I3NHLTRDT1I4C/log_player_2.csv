"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a limited time at the special price of $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $200 is far above your maximum budget of $120. It's important to start negotiations by rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $200 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in buying, but I'd need to see a price closer to $100.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is significantly lower than what I can agree to.  How about we meet in the middle at $160? I'm confident you'll be happy with the value you get at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $160 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $120. It's worth continuing negotiations to see if you can get closer to your desired price. You have several rounds left, so there's time to explore a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  This is a fair price that respects both our needs. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 130}
