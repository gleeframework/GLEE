"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this unique product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $15000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $12000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a little too high for me. I'm feeling more comfortable at $9000. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground here.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer, Bob. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm very close to accepting, but $10500 is still a stretch for me. Would you consider $9500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with this deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $9500, Bob. I think we've compromised enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10500 and $9500, which would be $10000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll accept it.",10000.0,Alice,7,
