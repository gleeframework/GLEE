"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this unique product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $15000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's too risky to accept at this point, as there's a chance Alice will not be willing to come down to your desired price.  It's better to start negotiating and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $11,000 is still above my budget. I want to see if I can push her further down to a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm feeling more comfortable at $9,000. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting closer, Bob. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my target price, $10,500 is still above my budget. I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground closer to $9,000. There are still a few rounds left, so I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm very close to accepting, but $10,500 is still a stretch for me. Would you consider $9,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $9500, Bob. I think we've compromised enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10500 and $9500, which would be $10000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll accept it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,000, which is still above my budget.  While there are a few rounds left, I'm starting to feel like she's not going to budge much lower.  It's getting risky to keep rejecting her offers, as I'm running out of time. It's better to secure the product from John at $8,000 now, as I'm confident I can get a good deal."
