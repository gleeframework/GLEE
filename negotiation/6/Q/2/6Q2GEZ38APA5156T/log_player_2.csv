"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it extremely valuable. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still too high.  There's room for negotiation. I'll reject and see if I can get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high for me. I'm aiming to get the product for as close to $600,000 as possible.  I'll reject and see if I can negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your previous offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $650,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  While I'd prefer to pay closer to $650,000,  $700,000 is still a good deal for me.  I can save a significant amount compared to buying from John. It's time to accept the offer."
