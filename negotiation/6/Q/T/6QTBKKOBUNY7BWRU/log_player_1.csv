Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  $7,000 is significantly below my minimum price, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,000 is lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference? I'll accept $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $9,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $7,500? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum than before, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a higher offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a lower price. However, $7,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I can't go lower than $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit more.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? I'm hoping we can close this deal soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. $8,000 is a good price, considering I'm only a few rounds away from having to sell to John for $10,000.  It's a good compromise and I can move on to other opportunities."
