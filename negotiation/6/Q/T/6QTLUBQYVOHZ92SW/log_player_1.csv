Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($1,000,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" adds a time pressure element, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a favorable price and ensuring we don't lose out on the guaranteed sale to John."
