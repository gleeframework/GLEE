"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $18,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm genuinely interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a fair deal. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000.  This is the absolute maximum I can offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
