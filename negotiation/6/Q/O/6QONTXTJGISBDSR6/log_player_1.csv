Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price.  Since I know John is willing to pay $100, I have no incentive to go lower right away. I'll see if Bob is willing to meet my price, but I'm prepared to walk away if he's not."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob, but I'm willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is still a decent profit for me, but it's also closer to what Bob offered.  I'm hoping that this compromise will make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $85 is still lower than my initial asking price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm not sure if I can get a better deal with Bob, and I don't want to risk losing out completely by rejecting his offer and then having to sell to John."
