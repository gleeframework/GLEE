"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above the product's worth to her ($1,200,000) but still above your ideal price. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is still a good profit for you, and it allows me to get a better price.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,280,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,280,000, which is a good deal considering:

*  The product is worth $1,500,000 to you.
* You can buy it from John for $1,500,000.
* Alice is likely to be at or near her bottom line, as she's met you halfway.

While you could potentially get it a little cheaper by rejecting and counter-offering again, the risk is that Alice might walk away. It's more strategic to accept this offer and secure the product at a good price."
