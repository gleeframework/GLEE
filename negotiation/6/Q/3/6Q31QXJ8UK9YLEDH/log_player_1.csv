Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80 from the sale. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $90 gives Bob a chance to get it for $10 less than his valuation, while you get to make a $10 profit above your minimum.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob for a higher price, rather than immediately going for the guaranteed $80 from John."
