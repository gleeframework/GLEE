"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000.  What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $650,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price.  While I agree it's a valuable product, I'm aiming for something closer to $720,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $720,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $780,000.  This is a great price for a product worth $800,000 to you, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",780000.0,Alice,5,
