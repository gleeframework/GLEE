"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value to you and allows me to make the purchase within my budget."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my target.  I'm aiming for a lower price, and rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating.  There's still room for a counteroffer that could be more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget.

This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but I can still do better. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer gives me another chance to make a counteroffer and hopefully secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $950,000. This price allows you to make a significant profit while remaining within my budget. It's a fair compromise and reflects the value of the product to both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1025000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the sale at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price significantly, and we're getting close to a deal.  While it's still above my ideal price, accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a reasonable cost without risking further negotiations. There's a chance she might reject my counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Also, buying from John at $1,500,000 is a much worse outcome."
