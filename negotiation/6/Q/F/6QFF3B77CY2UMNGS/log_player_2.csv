"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. My initial offer is $15000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth negotiating to try and get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $11000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. My counteroffer is $13500 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your desired price point, but it's getting closer. It's worth another round of negotiation to see if you can get the price down further. You're still within your budget with John's offer, so you can afford to be a bit more aggressive in your negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $13000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value you're looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above your maximum budget of $12,000. While there's still room for negotiation, you've already gone through several rounds and there's a risk that Alice will continue to hold firm on her price.  

Since John is willing to sell the product for your desired price, it's a safer bet to buy from him and avoid further negotiation."
