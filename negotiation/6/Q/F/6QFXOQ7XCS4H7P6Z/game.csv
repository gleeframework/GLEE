"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This reflects the significant value this product holds for you and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a lower offer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the value of the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a bit far off from what I'm aiming for.  Considering the value this product brings to your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a lower offer of $925,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to be mindful of my expenses.",925000.0,Bob,6,
