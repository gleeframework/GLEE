"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. While its true value to me is above $1,200,000, I recognize your keen interest and am willing to make a deal at $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's value to her, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. Buying from John saves you $300,000, which is a significant amount of money. Don't be swayed by the time pressure Alice is trying to create."
