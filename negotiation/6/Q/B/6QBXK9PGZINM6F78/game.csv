"Alice, your product is intriguing, but $1,200,000 is out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both see in this product.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it demonstrates my willingness to find a solution that works for both of us.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This offer represents a significant step towards finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
