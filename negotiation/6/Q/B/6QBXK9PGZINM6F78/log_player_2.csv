"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is intriguing, but $1,200,000 is out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it demonstrates my willingness to find a solution that works for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
