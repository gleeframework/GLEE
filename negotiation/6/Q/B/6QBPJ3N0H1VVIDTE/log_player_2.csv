"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a fair price, given its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it still allows you a healthy profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1300000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you, and allows for a smooth transaction. Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is a good price for Bob.  While he could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and ultimately forcing him to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer ensures a good deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
