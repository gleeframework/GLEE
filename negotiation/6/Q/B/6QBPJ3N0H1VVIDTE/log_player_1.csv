Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price, given its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I'm explicitly mentioning the value of the product to Bob, which can encourage him to accept.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not starting at my absolute maximum, allowing for negotiation if Bob wants to counter.
* **Plan B:** I can always fall back to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1300000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it still allows you a healthy profit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $1,300,000 is still above my minimum, it's significantly lower than my initial offer and doesn't reflect the product's true value.
* **Room for improvement:** I believe I can still get a better price by counter-offering. 
* **John is a backup:**  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, as I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you, and allows for a smooth transaction. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm not accepting Bob's low offer but also not rejecting outright. This keeps the negotiation going.
* **Meeting halfway:** My counter-offer is exactly halfway between my initial offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($1,300,000). This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Continuing to emphasize value:** I'm still reminding Bob of the product's value to him, trying to influence his decision. 
* **Positive language:** I'm using phrases like ""fair price"" and ""smooth transaction"" to keep the tone amicable."
