"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum of $150. This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully leads to a price closer to my desired value.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm indicating a willingness to negotiate, which could make Bob more likely to accept the offer or make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested in the product and willing to negotiate.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can likely get a higher price by counteroffering and continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Reasoning:** I explain my counteroffer with a reason, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Middle Ground:** $140 is closer to my desired price and potentially appealing to Bob. 
* **Fair Deal Emphasis:**  Reiterating the idea of a fair deal encourages Bob to see the value in my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $140. I'm thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and also significantly lower than my last counteroffer of $140.
* **Opportunity for a Better Price:**  While Bob's offer shows he's willing to negotiate, I believe I can likely get a higher price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Potential to Close the Deal:**  I have several rounds left and want to see if I can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $110 simply doesn't cover the value of this product.  Let's split the difference and go with $125. This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with Compromise:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but proposing a compromise that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Clear Justification:** I provide a clear justification for the new price, highlighting the value of the product and the need for a fair deal. 
* **Urgency:** I subtly imply that this might be my final offer to encourage Bob to consider it seriously. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a friendly and encouraging tone to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $100. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  We are now in round 6 out of 10, and I've already made several concessions. There's a risk that continued negotiation will only lead to further lowering of the price.
* **John's Offer:**  John offers a guaranteed $150, which is significantly better than the current negotiation with Bob.  
* **Minimizing Risk:** It's better to secure a certain profit with John than to risk ending up with a lower price from Bob, especially as time is running out."
