"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, there's always potential to negotiate further and save more.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. Starting with a counteroffer of $750,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate seriously while still aiming for a price that is significantly lower than his maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $820,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he's still willing to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price than $820,000.  There's still a significant difference between Alice's offer and Bob's initial counteroffer, indicating room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 780000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer, demonstrating his willingness to compromise.  The counteroffer of $780,000 is a good middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows that he's serious about buying the product but still believes there's room to negotiate a slightly lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob would still prefer a lower price, $810,000 is getting very close to his maximum budget. Continuing to negotiate might risk Alice walking away, or potentially leading to a counteroffer closer to $850,000. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking a higher cost or losing the deal entirely."
