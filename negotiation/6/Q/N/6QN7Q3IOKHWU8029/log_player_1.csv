{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I know its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My starting price is $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1100000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I have 9 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for me. Let's see if we can bridge this gap."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1125000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $1075000 or lower. Can we discuss a price that works for both of us? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still a bit low. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob as I have 6 rounds left to potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I see we're getting closer. Let's split the difference this time. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on funds. I'm willing to meet you at $1075000, which is my absolute maximum. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to move forward with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price. However, I have only 4 rounds left.  The risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing the deal with Bob is high. Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a sale and secures a decent profit."
