Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum price, giving room for negotiation.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? That way, we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? That way, we can both feel good about the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $87.50 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm concerned that Bob is not willing to negotiate further.  I'm not confident I can get a better offer from him, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  This ensures I reach my minimum target price and avoids further haggling with Bob."
