"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter, but I also have John as a fallback option if the negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take it, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,100,000. This demonstrates flexibility while still remaining above Bob's current offer. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product to him and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
