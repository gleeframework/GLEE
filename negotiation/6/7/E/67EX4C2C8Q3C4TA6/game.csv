"Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you a product of exceptional value.  I believe it's worth at least $1,000,000 to someone like you. To kick things off, I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price for a product worth $1,000,000 to you. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,400,000  doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This offer represents a significant discount from my initial price and ensures you're getting a great deal on something truly exceptional.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not convinced that $1,650,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than that. I'm offering $1,550,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, finding a middle ground is important. Let's do this: I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant move on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal. It's a win-win - you get an incredible product, and I get a fair price.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,600,000. I'm willing to go up a bit, but I think I can do better than that. I'm offering $1,575,000. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",1575000.0,Bob,6,
