Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but I understand its value might differ based on your needs.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the included maintenance and support,  $150 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $120 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In order to accommodate your offer while still providing value, I would like to suggest an alternative. Instead of the full package at $150, how about we discuss a customized plan?
