,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $105.  That seems fair to both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $105 yet. I'll meet you at $108, and that's as low as I'm willing to go.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $108 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'll go up to $103, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",103.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $103, but I'm willing to meet you at $106. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",106.0,Alice,7,
