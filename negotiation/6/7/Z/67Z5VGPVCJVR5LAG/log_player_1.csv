While we could continue negotiating, Bob is steadily increasing his offer and we are getting closer to the halfway point between our initial offers. Accepting $1,065,000 is a good deal at this stage, ensuring a profit and avoiding the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation reaching an impasse."
