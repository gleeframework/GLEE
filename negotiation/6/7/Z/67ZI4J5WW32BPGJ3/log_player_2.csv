"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's definitely a great product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's closer to his maximum budget, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Offering $8,500 allows for a potential compromise in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $9500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating for a better price. There's still room to reach a compromise within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,500. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his previous counteroffer of $8,500. This shows Alice that he's serious about this price point and is willing to stand firm. It also keeps the negotiation moving forward without conceding too much ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your guns, but I'm still not willing to go below $8800. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I think this product is worth more than $8500. How about we meet in the middle at $8700? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still $700 higher than Bob's ideal price. There are still 5 rounds remaining, giving Bob the opportunity to continue negotiating and potentially reach a lower price.  Additionally, he can always buy from John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $8,600, which is a fair middle ground for both of us.  Let's close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 8600}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is closer to Alice's last offer, but still below his own maximum budget. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about making a deal, but is also determined to get the best possible price. The message also emphasizes the urgency of closing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your limit, but I'm still not willing to go below $8700. I'm willing to make another small concession, but I think this product is worth more than $8600. How about we meet in the middle at $8650? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,650
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only three rounds remaining, Alice's offer is still $650 above Bob's desired price. There's a high chance that further negotiation will not lead to a price that meets Bob's budget. Given that Bob can secure the same product from John for $8,000, it's the most financially prudent decision to buy from John and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
