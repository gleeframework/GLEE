Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** Bob sees the product as worth $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $200,000 difference to negotiate within.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. Aiming slightly lower increases the chances of acceptance.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I recognize its significant value to your operations, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It's framed positively, highlighting the product's value to Bob.  
* **The Price:** $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 discount, making it an attractive proposition. This price also nets you a $150,000 profit over your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer.  You could experiment with slightly different prices (e.g., $1,125,000 or $1,175,000) to see how they impact the negotiation."
