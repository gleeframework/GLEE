"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a tempting price, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my budget. How about $750000? I think this would be a fair price for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to get closer to your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $800000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  I'm still a little hesitant to go that high, though.  How about $775000? It's a good compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer it to you for $795000. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for this incredible product.",795000.0,Alice,5,
