Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum price, but still leaves some room for negotiation with Bob.  We'll see if he accepts, and if not, we can adjust our strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but still leaves room for improvement.  It's worth trying to push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750} 
```

This counteroffer is a slight increase from Bob's offer. It's a compromise that still leaves me a good profit but might be appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my preferred price and I'm confident I won't get a better offer. Accepting it guarantees me a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
