"Alice,  $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I can't go above $850,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $900,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $875,000. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
