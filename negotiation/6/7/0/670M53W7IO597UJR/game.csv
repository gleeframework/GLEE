"Alice, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go over $850,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $975,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $975,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,5,
