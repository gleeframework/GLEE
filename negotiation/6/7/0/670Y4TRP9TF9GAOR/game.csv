,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm happy to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $137.50. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $137.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm comfortable going up to $115. This is my final offer, let me know if it works for you.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $115. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $140. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",140.0,Alice,5,
