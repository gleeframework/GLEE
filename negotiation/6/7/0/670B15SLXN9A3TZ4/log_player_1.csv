{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This provides you with some flexibility to lower the price if Bob pushes back too hard. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows for a negotiation process without immediately resorting to selling to John.

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's worth exploring if we can meet somewhere in the middle. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and continue the negotiation."

While $875,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can find common ground."
