Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000, as I mentioned earlier. I'm not sure I can go as low as $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,500. Since you have the option to buy from John for $8,000, it makes more financial sense to take that deal and save the extra $500."
