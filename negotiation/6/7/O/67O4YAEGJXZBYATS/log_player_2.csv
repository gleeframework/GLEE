"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product.  I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $13,000 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to get the product for much less than Alice's starting price. By starting with a very low offer, we establish a strong negotiating position. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This counter-offer leaves plenty of room for negotiation. Alice is likely to counter, and we can then gradually increase our offer. 
* **Pressure:** By mentioning the $8,000 alternative, we subtly remind Alice that she's not our only option. 

Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I can't go as low as $6,000, I'm willing to be flexible to make this work. How about we settle on $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice is coming down, but $10,500 is still significantly more than our target price and what John is offering. 
* **Continued Negotiation:**  We've signaled our interest, and Alice seems willing to negotiate. We need to keep pushing for a better deal.
* **Time Consideration:** We have plenty of rounds left, so there's no rush to accept a price we're not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I had in mind. I could potentially go up to $7,000.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:**  We're showing Alice that we're willing to move substantially from our initial offer to find a compromise.
* **Staying Below Target:**  $7,000 keeps us below our $8,000 walk-away point, giving us room to negotiate further if needed.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will give us a good indication of how low Alice is truly willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my original ask. To be fair,  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  I think that's a fair compromise.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** While Alice is making concessions, they're still fairly small.  We need to show her that we're willing to walk away to get a better deal.
* **John is Still Available:** The $8,000 price from John is a constant reminder that we have a viable alternative.
* **Strategic Timing:**  We're at the halfway point. Now is a good time to apply more pressure to see if Alice will make a more substantial move."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your original ask, but honestly, the gap between our positions is still pretty wide.  I can go up to $7,500, but I need to see some more flexibility on your end to make this deal happen. I also have to consider other options if we can't find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're acknowledging Alice's desire for a higher price while standing firm on our budget.
* **Small Increase, Clear Signal:** The small increase to $7,500 shows willingness to move, but the message makes it clear that this is close to our limit. 
* **Mentioning Alternatives:** Explicitly reminding Alice of ""other options"" keeps the pressure on and emphasizes that she needs to make a compelling offer.

We're getting into the later rounds of negotiation.  The next few offers will be crucial in determining whether we can secure a deal with Alice or if we need to go with John."
