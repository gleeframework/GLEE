"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $140 for it. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, appreciate the offer.  $140 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $155? That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can finalize the deal.",155.0,Bob,4,
