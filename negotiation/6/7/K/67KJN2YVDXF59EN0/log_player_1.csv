{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're still in the early stages of negotiation, and Bob is consistently moving closer to my price. While $962,500 is a tempting offer, I believe I can still secure a slightly higher price by remaining firm.  I'm willing to take a calculated risk for a couple more rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your persistence tells me you recognize the true value of this product. I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal quickly. How about $965,000?  This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair."", 
""product_price"": 965000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** By stating this is my ""final concession"" and a ""firm offer,"" I'm signaling to Bob that there's little room for further negotiation. This can encourage him to accept if he's genuinely interested.
* **Time Constraint:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob that we're nearing the halfway point of our negotiations. This might prompt him to act rather than risk me walking away.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating that the price is fair, which reinforces my position and avoids appearing overly aggressive."

# Bob's message: Thank you for your final offer, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $960,000 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I could likely push for a bit more, the potential gains are shrinking. Accepting $960,000 provides a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I receive the funds sooner, allowing me to potentially reinvest or utilize them for other opportunities.
* **Relationship Building:**  Accepting Bob's offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise and can foster goodwill for future interactions."
