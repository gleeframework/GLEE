"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you!  I'm asking for $120 to start. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $70 at this point.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",70.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 is a bit high, but $70 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $85?  That's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
