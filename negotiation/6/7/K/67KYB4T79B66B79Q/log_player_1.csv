Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  At $11,500, Bob is still getting a good deal, but you are also getting closer to your minimum price. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This price allows for some back-and-forth before you might have to consider John's offer.

Let me know if you want to make a different offer, and I'll explain the rationale behind it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your minimum desired price of $12,000.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Try to negotiate higher:** You can counteroffer with a price closer to your minimum, giving Bob a chance to come up a bit.
* **Keep John's offer in play:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the option of selling to John open, ensuring you get your desired price if negotiations with Bob stall. 

Let's see if we can get closer to your goal!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

Here's why I'm offering $11,000:

* **Meeting halfway:** This price is a compromise, halfway between your previous offer ($11,500) and Bob's offer ($10,500). 
* **Still above minimum:** It's still above your minimum price of $12,000, but it shows willingness to negotiate. 
* **Encouraging further negotiation:** It leaves room for Bob to come up a little bit, while also demonstrating that you are serious about getting a fair price. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $10,500 is a fair price. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has remained steadfast at $10,500, which is significantly below your minimum desired price of $12,000.  While you could continue negotiating, the risk of further rounds leading to a lower price is high, and the potential for Bob to further reduce his offer is also a concern. 

In this situation, selling to John for $12,000 is the most advantageous option. You achieve your minimum desired price and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower price."
