"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I could do $1,050,000.  I think that's a fair offer considering its current market value."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting with a significantly lower offer (60% of the difference between her offer and my limit) leaves room for negotiation while signaling I'm serious about the purchase.
* **Justification:** Mentioning ""current market value"" (even if vague) introduces an external factor to consider, potentially making her more receptive.
* **Polite and Professional:**  Maintaining a good tone is important for a smooth negotiation, even when disagreeing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,250,000,  which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to your budget, but you're still paying a premium over John's price. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further down before accepting her offer or resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,150,000?  I'm hoping we can close this deal soon."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer suggests a compromise by splitting the difference between her latest offer ($1,250,000) and my previous one ($1,050,000). 
* **Sense of Urgency (Slight):**  Mentioning ""closing the deal soon"" subtly implies I might have other options if negotiations drag on too long.
* **Still Below John's Price:**  This offer ensures I'm still attempting to get a better deal than John's $1,200,000 fallback."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000 as a final offer. If we can't find an agreement at this price, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has matched John's price. There's no longer any benefit to continuing negotiations with Alice, as you can get the same price from John without further effort or risk of the deal falling through."
