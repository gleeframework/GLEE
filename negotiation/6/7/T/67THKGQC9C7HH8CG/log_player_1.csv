Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $15,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Value Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk that Bob will reject a higher offer. However, since you have a backup buyer, you're not losing out on the base value of $10,000."
