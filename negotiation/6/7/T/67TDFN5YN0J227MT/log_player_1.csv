Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at my desired price of $150. This maximizes my potential earnings. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging message to hopefully entice Bob to consider the offer. 
* **John as Backup:** I know I have a guaranteed $150 from John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $90 for the product. Thank you for considering my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While I'm willing to sell to John for $150, there's still a chance I can get closer to my desired price by continuing negotiations with Bob.  
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price, but not by a significant amount.
* **Fairness Argument:** I'm appealing to Bob's sense of fairness by framing my offer as a compromise and highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** My counteroffer of $120 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, giving me room to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still think I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $100 for the product. I hope this offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Low:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Risk of Going Lower:** If I continue to negotiate, I risk lowering my price further and potentially ending up with a deal that's not worth it to me.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit and minimizes risk.  It's time to cut my losses with Bob and move on."
