Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, it's always best to try for a higher profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so there's a potential negotiation space.
* **Strong Starting Point:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 sets a strong initial point. It's significantly above Bob's perceived value, giving us room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message hints at the product's high demand and Bob's privileged position as the first potential buyer. This might encourage him to accept the offer quickly.

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, with John as a guaranteed buyer, we're not losing anything by aiming high initially."
