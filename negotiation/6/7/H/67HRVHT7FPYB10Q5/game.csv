"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that's worth a lot to me, and I think it could be very valuable to you as well. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get out of it. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really think the product has a lot of potential, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Can we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer, but $10,500 would be the absolute minimum I could accept.  I think this is still a great deal for you, considering the potential value of this product.  Let's try to find a middle ground here. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,500? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000, but that's my absolute final offer.  This product is truly valuable, and I believe it's a fantastic investment for you.  Let's make this happen. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
