Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product, but I'm not sure if it's within your budget.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the value, my initial price reflects the true worth and potential of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't go as low as $1,000,000.  How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is a fair price, considering my budget is $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's clear Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price. Rather than continue haggling and potentially losing a sure sale, it's more profitable to sell to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
