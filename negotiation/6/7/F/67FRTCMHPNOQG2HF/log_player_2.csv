"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $120 to Alice and $150 to you. This means there is room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer of $140 allows you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to offer you $130 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking to get a bit more for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer of $135 is a good deal for you, considering you're willing to pay up to $150 and it's closer to your desired price point. Accepting the offer is the best decision in this round."
