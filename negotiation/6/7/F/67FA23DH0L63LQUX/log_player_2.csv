"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,400,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth while leaving you with a substantial return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still more than what John is offering. You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer and going with John saves you a significant amount of money."
