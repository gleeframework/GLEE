Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $2,000,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate closer to my maximum willingness to pay, which is $1,500,000? I believe there might be room for compromise here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer matches John's standing offer. There's no point in further negotiation with Bob as his maximum willingness to pay is equal to what John is already offering. Accepting John's offer guarantees the best possible outcome for Alice in this scenario."
