Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. It also demonstrates that I believe the product has significant value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, and also lower than the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still keeping it higher than John's offer. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise but also that I believe the product is worth more than his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, it's more advantageous to sell to him rather than risk further negotiation with Bob that might not result in a higher price."
