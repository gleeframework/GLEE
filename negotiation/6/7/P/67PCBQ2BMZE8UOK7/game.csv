"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $9,000 is a little lower than I was hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's a good compromise for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $10,500. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $11,000. How about $10,750?  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,750. I'm willing to go up to $9,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at $10,250. It's a fair compromise that's closer to both of our positions. Let's try to find a solution in this final round.",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but I really think $9,750 is the maximum I can pay. Can you please meet me at this price?",9750.0,Bob,8,
