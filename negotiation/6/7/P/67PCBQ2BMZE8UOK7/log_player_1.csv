"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but significantly lower than my minimum ($15,000). 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to open the negotiation.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price allows for several rounds of counteroffers before reaching either my minimum or Bob's maximum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum of $15,000, it's still significantly below. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room to negotiate, and I want to see if Bob is willing to come up further.
* **Testing Bob's Interest:** By rejecting his offer, I can gauge how serious Bob is about acquiring the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $9,000 is a little lower than I was hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's a good compromise for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** My counteroffer aims for a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  
* **Reasonable Compromise:**  It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but also shows that I'm not willing to drop my price too drastically. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a friendly and positive tone to keep the negotiation flowing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $10,500. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Although Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000.
* **Test Bob's Limits:** By rejecting his offer, I can test how far Bob is willing to go in meeting my expectations.
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:** I believe there's still room to negotiate, and I want to see if Bob will increase his offer further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $11,000. How about $10,750?  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession by lowering my price slightly. This shows flexibility without sacrificing too much of my desired margin.
* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, aiming to be closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum.
* **Positive & Motivating Tone:** The message remains positive and encouraging, emphasizing finding a solution that works for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,750. I'm willing to go up to $9,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob has increased his offer slightly, it's still significantly below my minimum of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There are still a few rounds left, and I believe there's room for Bob to increase his offer further.
* **Testing Bob's Limits:** By rejecting his offer, I can continue to gauge his seriousness and see if he's willing to come closer to my desired price point. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I'm hoping to secure a higher price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at $10,250. It's a fair compromise that's closer to both of our positions. Let's try to find a solution in this final round."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making what I consider my final offer, as we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.

* **Emphasis on Compromise:** The message highlights that my offer is a compromise that aims to be closer to both of our positions. 
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the limited number of rounds remaining to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but I really think $9,750 is the maximum I can pay. Can you please meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, the odds of Bob increasing his offer significantly are slim.
* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Guaranteed Deal:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and ensures I don't lose out on a better deal. 
* **Risk of Losing Out:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks ending up with a lower price or no deal at all, while John's offer is a sure thing."
