"Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price. Buying from John immediately guarantees the product at your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $10,000. This is the price I'm willing to pay for the product. It's important to start with a strong offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate down. If she's not, I can always buy from John for the same price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject and see if I can get a better deal by counter-offering. Buying from John is still an option if negotiations don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $10,000 to $11,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise. It's still below her current offer, but hopefully, it's close enough to encourage further negotiation.  If she rejects again, I can still go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $12,000. This is within my budget and significantly better than her initial offer. It's time to accept this offer and secure the product. While I can still get it from John for $10,000, it's not worth the risk of Alice rejecting my next counteroffer.  It's better to take the slightly higher price and get the product now."
