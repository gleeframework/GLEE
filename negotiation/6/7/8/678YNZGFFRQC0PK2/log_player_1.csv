Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $60 is far too low for me.  This product is high-quality and I'm confident it will meet your needs. How about we try $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, Alice, but I have a budget in mind. Could you do $75? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I can't go as low as $75.  This product is worth a lot more to me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he will reach a price that's significantly better than $87.50.  You have a guaranteed offer of $120 from John, so it makes more financial sense to cut your losses with Bob and sell to John."
