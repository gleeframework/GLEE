{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $175 is far above your maximum price. It's better to reject and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with my maximum price of $100. This is a firm offer, as I can always buy the product from John for that price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$155 is still above my maximum price. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still below my maximum.  I want to see if Alice is willing to compromise."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $145 is getting closer to my maximum, I'm still going to reject and see if I can get a better deal.  There are still several rounds left, and I'm not in a rush."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm going to increase my offer again, but I'm still below my maximum.  Alice is clearly coming down in price, so I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $135 is tempting, I'm still going to reject.  We're getting closer, but I'm going to see if I can get that last bit of wiggle room. I'm not desperate, and I have the option to buy from John.  There are still a few rounds left, so I'm going to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm going to meet Alice halfway on this one. $125 is a reasonable compromise. It's still below my maximum price, and it demonstrates I'm serious about reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

It's getting very close to the end of the negotiation, and I'm confident that I can't get a lower price from Alice.  $130 is only $30 over my maximum price, and I'm getting a pretty good deal compared to what I could have gotten from John.  I'll accept the offer."
