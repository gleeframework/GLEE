"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $10,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your value.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows for a smooth transaction. What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,4,
