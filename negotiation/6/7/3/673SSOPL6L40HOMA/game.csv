"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,250,000 is well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which still represents a good value for you given your stated worth.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your position, the value of this product is substantial, and $1,200,000 doesn't reflect that. To move things forward, I'm willing to consider $1,850,000. I believe this price point represents a fairer deal for both of us.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,850,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
