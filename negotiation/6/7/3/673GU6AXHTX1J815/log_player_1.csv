Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to secure a price closer to my minimum. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Offering $100 leaves room for potential counteroffers from Bob. This allows us to find a price that works for both of us.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and optimistic, which may increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer.

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the unfolding negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my threshold of $120. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can potentially get closer to my minimum by continuing the negotiation. 
* **John's offer is a fallback:**  I have a guaranteed $120 from John, so I can afford to be firm with Bob. 

**Next steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to be flexible. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, subtly implying that $95 is still a good deal for him.
* **Open-ended question:**  I'm prompting Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation open and showing I'm interested in finding a solution.

**Important Note:** This is still a high price for Bob, but I'm hoping to find a middle ground where we can both agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Let me see if I can adjust my budget accordingly. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob is willing to go up to $90, it's still below my minimum threshold of $120.
* **Time is money:**  Further negotiation with Bob will likely take time and effort, and there's no guarantee we'll reach an agreement.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John offers me a guaranteed $120, which meets my minimum requirement and avoids the risk of further negotiation.

**Conclusion:** It's in my best interest to sell the product to John, as it ensures a quick and profitable outcome."
