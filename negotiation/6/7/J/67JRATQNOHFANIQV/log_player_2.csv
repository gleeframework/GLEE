"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $100.**  You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating.
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so you have time to explore a lower price.**  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'd be happy to buy it for $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm offering $85, which is $5 less than Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying but also want a better price.
* **Within my budget:** $85 is within my budget of $100 and still leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  Offering $85 allows for a potential middle ground and gives Alice a reason to negotiate rather than simply rejecting my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $87.50? I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Within budget:** Alice's offer of $87.50 is comfortably within my budget of $100.
* **Middle ground:**  Alice's offer represents a reasonable compromise, meeting us in the middle between our previous offers.
* **Time factor:**  While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product quickly."
