{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate the offer. However, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $11,000. Would you consider $10,750? It's a small step up from your offer, but it brings us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's still lower than my initial goal, it's a fair price considering there are only 4 rounds remaining.  It's better than selling to John for $10,000 and leaves me with some room for negotiation if I need to sell to John in the future."
