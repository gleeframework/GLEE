"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with a price of $1800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's exceptional qualities and its potential to bring significant benefits to the right buyer.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm and the product's potential, $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $800000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the market value of similar products.  I'm confident this is a win-win scenario, allowing you to move the product quickly while giving me a great deal.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints. However, I'm afraid $800000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. I believe this price still represents a great value for you, while also allowing me to meet my minimum requirements.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1400000 is still above my budget, but I'm willing to go to $1000000. This reflects the value I see in the product, but it's also the maximum I can reasonably afford. I'm hoping we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1000000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
