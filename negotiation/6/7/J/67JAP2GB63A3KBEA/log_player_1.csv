Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm and the product's potential, $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $800000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the market value of similar products.  I'm confident this is a win-win scenario, allowing you to move the product quickly while giving me a great deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
