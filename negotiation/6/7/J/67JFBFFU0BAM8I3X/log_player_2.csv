"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll get a great value out of it. Would you like to make it yours for $15000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is above his budget and he can get the same product from John for $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $14000, which is a great compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the same product from John for $12,000. It's worth seeing if he can get Alice down to $12,000 or closer."
