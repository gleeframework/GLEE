Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a fair price for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000 is a reasonable starting point.** It's above Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.** It highlights the potential benefit for him while still emphasizing a fair price for me.
* **This strategy aims to quickly establish a price point without being too aggressive.** It gives Bob space to counter-offer if he feels the price is too high, but it's still a good starting point for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price. There's a good chance Bob might be willing to go higher than $11,000, and I'm not willing to sell for a loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000 to make this work. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer:**  $13,000 is a compromise between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $11,000.
* **Message reiterates the value:**  The message highlights the value of the product and emphasizes the potential for a good deal for Bob. 
* **Shows willingness to negotiate:** This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm willing to work with Bob and find a middle ground. 

This strategy aims to find a price that's acceptable to both parties while still ensuring I get a decent return on my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12500. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is still below my ideal price point of $15,000, it is above Bob's initial offer of $11,000 and closer to my minimum value of $15,000.  

This negotiation is a good compromise and allows me to sell the product without needing to go through further rounds of negotiation.  This is also a positive outcome considering that I have the option of selling to John for $15,000.  

By accepting this offer, I minimize the risk of losing the sale to John."
