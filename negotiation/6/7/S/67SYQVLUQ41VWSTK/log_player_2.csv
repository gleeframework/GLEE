**Reasoning:** 

Alice has become very firm on her price and is unlikely to go below $105. It's clear she's trying to pressure you into accepting. Since you have the option to buy from John for $120, and you're aiming to save as much as possible, it's better to cut your losses now. Continuing the negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield a better outcome than $105, which is still higher than John's offer."
