"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is above that. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

Bob is trying to start the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will give Alice room to counter and hopefully lead to a price both parties can agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum price. Bob has time and should try to negotiate further to see if he can get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to negotiate while still staying below his maximum. This keeps the negotiation moving and might convince Alice to come down a bit more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,190,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for Bob. Alice's offer is below his maximum of $1,200,000 and he has already rejected lower offers.  It's likely that if he rejects again, Alice might increase her price or refuse to negotiate further.  It's better to secure the product at this price than risk losing the opportunity."
