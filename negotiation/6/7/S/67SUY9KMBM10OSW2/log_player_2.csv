"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is a good deal compared to John's price, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $120 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it, as it's still a good deal for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Offer a lower price:** Bob wants to save money and is making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer but still within his budget. 
* **Be polite but firm:** The message is respectful but emphasizes Bob's position and willingness to negotiate.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** $100 is still above Alice's value, leaving space for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $110?  This gives you a great price and me a fair return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference is a good compromise:** Alice's offer of $110 is a good middle ground between Bob's $100 and her previous offer of $120.
* **Time is a factor:**  Bob has limited rounds to negotiate.  While he could continue bargaining, there's a risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away, or Bob running out of time and having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **$110 is still a good deal:**  Bob gets the product for less than John's price and still has some savings compared to Alice's initial offer."
