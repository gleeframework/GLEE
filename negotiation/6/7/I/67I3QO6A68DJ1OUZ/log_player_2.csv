Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to budge much further.  While we could try for one last counteroffer, there's a significant risk she won't budge and we'll lose out on the guaranteed $8,000 option with John."
