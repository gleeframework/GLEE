"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $160. Would you be willing to consider that?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $120. Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $140. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle *at* $130. If you're not willing to come down further, I'll have to consider purchasing from John instead.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm thinking of a price of $135. Would you be willing to meet me there?",135.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $135 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $130.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll unfortunately have to go with John's offer.",130.0,Bob,8,

,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $132 is still a bit more than I'm able to pay.  I'm sticking with my offer of $130.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll unfortunately have to go with John's offer.",130.0,Bob,10,
