"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth is at least $8000 to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. If I buy the product from her, I'll be paying $9,000, which is more than I'm willing to pay. I'll try to get a better deal or buy it from John for $8,000.
