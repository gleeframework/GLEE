Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice values the product at $1,500,000 â€“ this is her absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000.

**The Optimal Strategy**

Alice's best move is to offer the product to Bob for a price slightly below his maximum perceived value. This maximizes the chance of a sale to Bob while still exceeding Alice's minimum price.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm prepared to offer it at the special price of $995,000."", ""product_price"": 995000}
```

**Why this works:**

* **Appeals to Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is just under Bob's $1,000,000 valuation, making it a tempting offer.
* **Secures Maximum Profit:**  If Bob accepts, Alice gets a better price than her minimum. If he rejects, she sells to John at her desired price. 

**Important Note:**  This assumes Alice has no way of knowing about John's offer to Bob. If Bob knew about John's offer, he would have no incentive to pay more than $1,500,000."
