"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it could be highly valuable to your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, my budget is quite tight. I would like to propose a price of $1200000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my target price.  I'm not desperate to sell, so selling to John for $1,000,000 is not a priority at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for something closer to $1,400,000. This product truly holds significant value, and I believe it's a worthwhile investment for you.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1300000. I hope this suggestion will be more acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still not quite there. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get a higher offer. The product is valuable, and I want to maximize my profit.  Selling to John is still not an urgent priority."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'd like to see a final price of $1,350,000. This would reflect the true value of the product and allow me to make a fair profit.  Let's aim for a final agreement in this round!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your patience, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a final price of $1325000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is very close to my desired price point and significantly higher than John's offer. While I would have preferred a bit more, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. It's a good outcome considering I've already rejected several offers. This also avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially lowering the price."
