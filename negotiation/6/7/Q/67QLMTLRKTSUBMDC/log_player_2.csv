"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and while I value it highly, I'm willing to offer it to you for $135.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer of $135 is less than your maximum budget of $150 and cheaper than buying from John for $150. It's a good deal!"
