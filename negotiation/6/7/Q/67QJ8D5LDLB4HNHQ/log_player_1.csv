Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if Bob makes a counteroffer.  It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $8,000, so I'm not risking losing too much by starting high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from him.  It's safer to secure the sale now than risk further negotiation."
