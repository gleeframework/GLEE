Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000 for the product. This is a good compromise that gets us closer to a deal.

While I could push for more, accepting $1,075,000 is a strong profit. It avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further protracted negotiations."
