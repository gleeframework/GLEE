"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to negotiate?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Would you be willing to consider that price?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a minimum of $16,000 to make this deal worthwhile. How about we meet at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
