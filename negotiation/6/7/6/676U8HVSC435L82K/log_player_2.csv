Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a minimum of $16,000 to make this deal worthwhile. How about we meet at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Alice is unlikely to go below $13,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at $12,000 and avoid further negotiation."
