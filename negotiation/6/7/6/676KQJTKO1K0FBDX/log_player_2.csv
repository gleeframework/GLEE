"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a truly exceptional item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth more to Alice than to Bob, so it's likely Alice will be willing to negotiate. Rejecting the initial offer will allow Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This price takes into account your budget and still reflects the product's true worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price point. By rejecting, Bob can continue negotiating and try to get a lower price.  He's already shown his willingness to pay around $850,000, and it's likely Alice will come down further to secure the sale."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal. I'll offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still above Bob's desired price point.  It's clear that Alice is unwilling to go lower, and continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield a better price.  Buying from John for $800,000 ensures Bob gets the product for a price within his budget and saves him a significant amount of money."
