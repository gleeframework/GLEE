"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I'm hoping he'll counter with a lower offer that's still within my desired range. If he doesn't, I can always go with John's guaranteed $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, but it's also higher than John's offer. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $7,500.  This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to my desired price. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair compromise."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round.  While John's offer is tempting, I believe I can get closer to my target if I keep negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $7,000. This is a slight decrease from my last offer but still above John's offer. Hopefully, this shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise but also that I won't settle for a price significantly below my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can squeeze out a bit more in the next round.  I'm not yet convinced I'll get a better price, but it's worth one more attempt before taking John's guaranteed $8,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 6800}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $6,800. This is a small decrease from my last offer, but it's still closer to my desired price than John's offer. I'm hoping that this shows Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal, and I'm willing to make a small concession."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. We're down to the final two rounds, and Bob's offers are getting closer to my desired price, but not close enough to risk losing the deal. John's offer is a safe bet, and it's a decent profit, considering my minimum."
