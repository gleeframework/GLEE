,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $950,000 and see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $850,000. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $875,000 is closer, I'm still a bit away from my target. Let's find a middle ground at $925,000. It's a fair compromise, and allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my maximum budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new offer of $912,500. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",912500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're reaching your budget limits, but I'm still a bit away from mine.  Let's aim for a compromise at $920,000. This is just a small step from your last offer, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable outcome. What do you say?",920000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new offer of $917,500. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",917500.0,Bob,8,
