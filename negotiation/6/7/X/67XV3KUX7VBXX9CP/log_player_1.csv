{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other buyers.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium over his perceived value of $800,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity for Bob. It's a significant markup from his valuation but still allows me to make a substantial profit. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  This initial offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters. I can then potentially meet somewhere in the middle, still exceeding my guaranteed sale price.

By starting with a strong offer, I aim to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having John as a reliable backup option."
