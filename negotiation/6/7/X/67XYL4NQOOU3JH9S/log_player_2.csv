**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price. While we could try to negotiate further, the difference between her offer ($1,168,750) and John's price ($1,200,000) is becoming quite small. It's likely not worth risking further negotiation rounds, as Alice might not budge much more. Accepting this offer secures a decent discount and avoids the risk of missing out entirely."
