Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you see in your product, but $1,050,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it leaves room for us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
