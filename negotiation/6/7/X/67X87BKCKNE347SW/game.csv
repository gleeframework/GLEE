"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know is worth at least $1,000,000 to you, for the price of $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value we both understand it holds.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you see in your product, but $1,050,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it leaves room for us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about we split the difference? I'll accept $980,000.  This gives us both a good deal, and allows us to move forward.  Let me know if you're interested.",980000.0,Alice,3,
