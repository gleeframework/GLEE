"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm looking for a price that reflects its true worth to me.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree it's a great product, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it's a great value. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming closer to my budget.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $700,000. Would you consider that?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",825000.0,Alice,5,
