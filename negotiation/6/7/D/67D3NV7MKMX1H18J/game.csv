"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,500 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference again. How about $9,000?  I'm confident you'll find the product to be a great value at that price.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but $8,250 is still a bit too low for me. How about $8,750?  Let's make this deal happen.",8750.0,Alice,7,
