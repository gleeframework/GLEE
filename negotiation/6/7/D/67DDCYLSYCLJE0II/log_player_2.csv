Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130. It's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $130 is still over your budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if she'll go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit out of my price range. How about we split the difference and I pay $115?  It's a fair compromise that would allow us both to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $115 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but how about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and it allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is closer to your budget, it's still above your limit of $100.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further with Alice, and keep in mind you have the option of buying from John for $100 if the negotiation falls apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $125 is still above my budget. Would you consider $120 as a final price?  It's a fair deal for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $120 is still a bit too low. Let's make it $122.50. It's a final compromise, and it allows us to both walk away with a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $122.5 is still above my budget. Although it's close, I'm not willing to go that high. At this point, it's better to buy the product from John for $100.  It's the best deal available to me, and I can guarantee I'll be within my budget."
