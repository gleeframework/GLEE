"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My starting price is $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130. It's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit out of my price range. How about we split the difference and I pay $115?  It's a fair compromise that would allow us both to make a deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $115 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but how about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and it allows us both to walk away happy.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $125 is still above my budget. Would you consider $120 as a final price?  It's a fair deal for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $120 is still a bit too low. Let's make it $122.50. It's a final compromise, and it allows us to both walk away with a good deal.",122.5,Alice,7,
