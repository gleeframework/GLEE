Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find really valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $120.  Offering it just below his maximum valuation increases the likelihood of a sale at the highest possible profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, starting at $110 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate (if he's inclined) without going below your minimum acceptable price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a backup buyer, John, ensuring you won't be left empty-handed. This knowledge empowers you to aim for a higher price with Bob."
