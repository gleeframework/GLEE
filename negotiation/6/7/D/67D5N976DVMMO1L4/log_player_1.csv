Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before it hits the open market. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($800,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price point agreeable to both parties. 
* **Highlight Exclusivity:**  By emphasizing that John is a guaranteed buyer, we create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially encouraging Bob to accept a higher price."
