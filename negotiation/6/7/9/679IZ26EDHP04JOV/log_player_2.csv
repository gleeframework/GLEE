"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try to negotiate a lower price.  You have a clear upper limit of $1,500,000, so rejecting Alice's offer gives you the opportunity to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that is substantially lower than Alice's initial offer. This strategy aims to:

* **Signal my serious interest:** Shows Alice that I am willing to negotiate and potentially secure a good deal.
* **Leave room for compromise:** There's still space for negotiation if Alice counters with a price closer to $900,000.
* **Maximize potential savings:** If successful, this counteroffer could save me a substantial amount of money compared to Alice's initial offer.

I'm keeping in mind my budget constraint of $1,500,000 and aiming for a price that would give me a significant margin of safety."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, but it's still beneficial to try for a lower price. I can still potentially save a significant amount of money by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from $700,000 to $750,000. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a good deal. The goal is to meet somewhere in the middle between my previous offer and her last offer. This strategy aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** Demonstrate my willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain pressure:**  I'm not accepting her last offer but still trying to push for a lower price.
* **Increase chances of agreement:** This counteroffer is likely more appealing to Alice than my previous one.

I'm still keeping in mind my budget constraint of $1,500,000 and aiming for a price that would allow me to save a considerable amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is getting closer to my desired price range and is significantly lower than John's offer of $1,500,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer and I'll end up paying John's higher price.  At this point, accepting Alice's offer guarantees a good deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
