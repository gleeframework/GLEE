Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, your initial offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000,  which is a fair price considering my maximum limit. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
