"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, your initial offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000,  which is a fair price considering my maximum limit. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than what I can accept. This product has incredible potential, and I'm confident it will bring you significant value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's try to close the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I can't go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. I believe this price fairly reflects the potential returns you'll see.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,400,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is my final offer.  This is a reasonable price, considering I'm very close to my maximum budget.  Let's find a way to make this deal work.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
