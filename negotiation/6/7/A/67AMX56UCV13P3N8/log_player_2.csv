You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $950,000, while John is selling it for $1,000,000. 
* **You're still saving money:**  Even though Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000), it's still lower than what you'd pay John.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option for Bob, as it saves him $50,000 compared to buying from John."
