"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is more than I can afford.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a deal that works for us both. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $10,000?  That would be a good compromise, and I'm confident we can make this work.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from.  Let's try to bridge the gap. How about $12,000? That's a significant price drop on my end, and I'm hoping we can close the deal with this.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's my absolute limit.  If you're not willing to come down that much, I'm going to have to consider buying from John.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is a significant investment for you. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but that's my final offer.  I need to make sure this is a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,7,
