"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both room to be happy with the outcome. Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,500. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $9,500. That's the best I can do.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about meeting in the middle, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree it's a good value for the product. How does that sound?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $9,200. That's the lowest I can go.",9200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,200 is still below what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,600? That way we both compromise a bit and come to a fair solution. Let's close this deal!",9600.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $9,300. That's the lowest I can go without going over my budget.",9300.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,300 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet halfway and settle on $9,400. It's a fair price that gets us both closer to our goals. This is our last chance to close the deal - what do you say?",9400.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $9,200. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price.",9200.0,Bob,10,
