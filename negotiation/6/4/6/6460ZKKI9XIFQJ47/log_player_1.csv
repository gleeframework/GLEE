"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than my minimum, I'm not ready to sell for that price yet.  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both room to be happy with the outcome. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum. I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob to make him feel like he's getting a good deal. I'm also expressing my eagerness to finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,500. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $9,500. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to sell for that. I believe I can still push for a higher price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point about meeting in the middle, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree it's a good value for the product. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm dropping my price again, but I'm still holding firm above $9,500. I'm focusing on the ""fairness"" aspect to make Bob feel like he's not being taken advantage of, while also reaffirming the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $9,200. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,200 is tempting, I'm still holding out hope for a higher price. I'm not giving up yet, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,200 is still below what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,600? That way we both compromise a bit and come to a fair solution. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9600}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground that feels closer to my target price.  I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" aspect and urging Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $9,300. That's the lowest I can go without going over my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,300 is getting close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell at that price yet. There's still one round left, and I believe I can get a better price. I'm not ready to sell to John for $8,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,300 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet halfway and settle on $9,400. It's a fair price that gets us both closer to our goals. This is our last chance to close the deal - what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9400}
```

I'm emphasizing the ""last chance"" aspect to encourage Bob to accept the offer. I'm also trying to find a middle ground between his offer and my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $9,200. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my limit for negotiation with Bob. While $9,200 is better than my absolute minimum, it's still not satisfactory given the value of the product.  With only one round left, the risk of not closing a deal is too high.  Selling to John at $8,000 is a safer and more guaranteed option."
