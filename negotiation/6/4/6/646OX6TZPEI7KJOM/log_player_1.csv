"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming for a good profit. It also emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob, making the deal more appealing.  I've left room for negotiation, knowing I can always fall back on John's offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $950000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not ready to settle for that price just yet.  I believe I can get closer to my target price of $950,000 by continuing to negotiate. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a good start, it's still a bit lower than what I was hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you, and still allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $900000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more of a discount.  I'm willing to go to $875000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's aim for a win-win scenario. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as there's a good chance we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll counter with a price between Bob's offer and my last offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $887,500. This offer reflects the value of the product and allows us to close this deal fairly. Let's not let this opportunity slip away."", ""product_price"": 887500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $887500 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $880000.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is now very close to my ideal price. While I would love to push for a little more, time is running out, and I'm confident I can do better than John's offer. It's time to secure this deal."
