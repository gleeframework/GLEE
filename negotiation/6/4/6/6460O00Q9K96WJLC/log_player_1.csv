Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,500,000.  It's a unique opportunity with a lot of potential.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This is a starting point for negotiation.  Here's why I chose this price:

* **Higher than the minimum:** It's above my minimum of $1,000,000, leaving room for potential negotiation.
* **Realistic but ambitious:**  It's a price that reflects the value I see in the product, but also allows for some bargaining. 
* **The message is friendly and encouraging:**  It doesn't immediately come across as overly aggressive.

**Important considerations for future negotiation:**

* **Bob's reaction:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and his overall attitude.
* **John's offer:** I'll keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as a safety net. If the negotiation with Bob drags on or gets too low, I'll have to decide if it's worth selling to John.
* **My own risk tolerance:**  I'll need to decide how much I'm willing to risk in terms of time and effort to get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is a decent starting point, it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price.  

I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for something closer to $1,400,000 to make this deal work.  This product has significant potential, and I believe this price reflects its true value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Highlighting value:**  The message again emphasizes the product's potential, reminding Bob of the benefits he'll gain from the deal.
* **Asking for feedback:** I'm leaving the door open for continued discussion and potential compromise.

**Next steps:**

* I'll be closely watching Bob's response to this counteroffer.
* If he rejects it, I'll need to consider how much lower I'm willing to go.
* I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a backup if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product has significant potential, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1250000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This negotiation has gone on for a few rounds, and while I'd prefer a higher price, I'm starting to feel the pressure.  Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is significantly better than John's offer of $1,000,000.  I'm going to accept this offer to secure the sale and avoid further haggling."
