I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price if I continue negotiating."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $110?  It's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still slightly less than what I hoped for, it's a good deal considering the limited rounds.  It's also close to my minimum price and likely the best I'll get from Bob."
