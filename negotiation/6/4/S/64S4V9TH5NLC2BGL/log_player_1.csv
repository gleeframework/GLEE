"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe it holds significant potential for your business. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High initial offer:** This sets a strong starting point and allows for room to negotiate down.
* **Focus on value:** Mentioning the product's potential for Bob's business emphasizes its worth and can encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Open to discussion:**  The message indicates a willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel more comfortable exploring the deal.

**Note:** This initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.  The goal is to push for a higher price, knowing that we can always fall back on the $1,500,000 offer from John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable deal. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below our minimum value.**  We are aiming for at least $1,500,000 and are currently at $1,200,000.  Accepting this offer would be a significant loss.
* **We have 8 rounds remaining.**  There's ample time to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price. 
* **Selling to John guarantees our minimum value.**  While we want to try and get more, knowing we have John as an alternative helps us stand firm in negotiations with Bob. 

We will counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our current position and Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for this product.  Considering its potential value for your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This offer is still a fair reflection of the product's worth, while also giving you a significant price advantage."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** This counteroffer moves significantly closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a price that's above our minimum value.
* **Highlighting value:**  We again emphasize the product's potential for Bob's business, justifying our stance and potentially encouraging him to consider a higher price. 
* **Maintaining flexibility:** We show a willingness to negotiate while still positioning ourselves for a favorable outcome.

**Strategy:** By making a substantial counteroffer, we hope to encourage Bob to come closer to our desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,700,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to our minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is very close to our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **We have 6 rounds remaining:**  There's still time to try and secure a better deal.
* **We have the option to sell to John:** If we can't get a higher price from Bob, we can always fall back on John's offer. 

We will counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the gap and reach a mutually agreeable price. While we're close to our minimum, we can still try to negotiate for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,400,000 is closer, I'm still a bit off on that price. Considering the product's unique features and how it can benefit your business, I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000. This price reflects a fair compromise while still ensuring I can cover my costs. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:** This counteroffer only raises the price by $50,000, showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to get closer to our target.
* **Focus on value:** We again highlight the product's benefits for Bob's business to justify the price. 
* **Positive language:** Using phrases like ""Let's make this deal happen!""  encourages a sense of urgency and cooperation.

**Strategy:** This small counteroffer aims to create a sense of momentum towards closing the deal. We are getting closer to Bob's offer, while still maintaining a price that is slightly above our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm getting close to my limit, so I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Falling below our minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is now below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited time:**  We have only 4 rounds remaining.  It's unlikely we can negotiate a higher price with Bob within this timeframe.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John ensures we receive our minimum desired price and avoid any further risk of negotiation with Bob.

While we prefer to get the highest possible price, with limited time and Bob's offer falling below our minimum, selling to John is the most financially secure option at this point."
