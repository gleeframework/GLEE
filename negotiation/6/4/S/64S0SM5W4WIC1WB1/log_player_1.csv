Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm asking for $100. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a good profit for you.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going straight for $120 might scare Bob off. Offering a price that seems fair increases the likelihood of a deal.
* **Secure a Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $80 gives you a safety net. You don't *need* to go below that price."
