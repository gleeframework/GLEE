"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation. While $1,800,000 is a significant investment, I believe this product's long-term value and potential for your specific needs warrant a higher price. Would you be willing to consider $2,100,000?",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $2,100,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1950000.0,Bob,4,
