Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** I value the product at $80.
* **Bob's maximum willingness to pay:**  Bob values the product at $120.
* **Negotiation space:** This leaves a potential negotiation space of $40 ($120 - $80).
* **Maximizing my profit:** By offering $110, I can secure a higher price than John's offer, ensuring a bigger profit for me. 
* **Balancing risk:** While I could try to ask for closer to $120, it risks Bob rejecting the offer and me having to settle for John's $80. 

This offer balances maximizing my profit while also minimizing the risk of Bob rejecting the deal."
