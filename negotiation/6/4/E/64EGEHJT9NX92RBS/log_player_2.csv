"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by myself. Given its high quality and unique features, I believe it would greatly benefit you. Considering its true worth, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects its value while ensuring you find it within your budget. Would you be interested in discussing this further? Please let me know if you're open to negotiations or if there's a specific price range you're considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial message is just salesmanship. While it hints at negotiation, her offer of $120 is still significantly higher than your $80 maximum and John's offer. You have a strong alternative with John, so you should try to negotiate a better price with Alice first."
