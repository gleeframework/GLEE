Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. Your offer of $925,000 is getting closer to my target, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've already acknowledged the product has for you, and it's still below my minimum price of $1,500,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me at $975,000. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you've already acknowledged the product has for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has stated this is her final offer.  Even though she is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go as low as we'd like, especially with fewer rounds left. Taking the guaranteed deal with John for $800,000 makes more sense than risking a higher final price from Alice."
