"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price considering your profit margin and the value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $950,000 is a good starting point,  I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm offering you the product for $1,050,000.
