This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum. This allows for room for negotiation while still giving you a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $10,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if we can reach a compromise."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I am still looking to keep my expenses lower. Could we perhaps aim for $10,500? I believe this would be a reasonable price for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable with his offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm not ready to sell for less than $11,500 yet."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While Bob is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, I am now starting to believe that further negotiation is not going to lead to a better outcome for me. I am not sure if he will ever agree to my price.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, I will sell to John to avoid any further negotiation and get my desired price."
