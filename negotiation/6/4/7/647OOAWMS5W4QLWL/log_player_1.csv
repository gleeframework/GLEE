Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $11,500. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, even at this price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn as much as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than your fallback option (John).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,500 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes that this is a special offer just for Bob and hints at the product's value to encourage him to accept."
