"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  While I'm motivated to strike a deal, I can't go as low as $900,000.  Let's settle at $1,100,000.  This offer reflects the product's true value.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
