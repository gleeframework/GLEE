"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,000,000. It's a steal considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, hoping to capture a large portion of the potential value Bob might see in the product.  However, I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm willing to negotiate downwards if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1500000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $800000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the same as John's, so I'm going to accept. I'm happy to get my minimum target price. There's no reason to risk losing the deal with Bob or continuing to negotiate."
