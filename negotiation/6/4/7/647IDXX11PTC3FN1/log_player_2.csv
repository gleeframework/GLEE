"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset for you. I'm offering it to you at a special price, considering our potential long-term partnership.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's message is vague and doesn't guarantee a better deal despite mentioning a ""special price.""  Since you know John will sell the product for $800,000, it makes more financial sense to go directly to John and avoid potentially overpaying."
