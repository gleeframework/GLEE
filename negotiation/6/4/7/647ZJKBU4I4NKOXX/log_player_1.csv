"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal considering the value it offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is close to my minimum acceptable value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to emphasize the perceived value to Bob.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This price allows for several rounds of counteroffers before reaching my minimum acceptable value. 

This strategy balances the need to maximize profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $700,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.**  While I want to close the deal, selling for $700,000 would be a major loss for me. 
* **I have time and other options.**  With 9 rounds left and the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, I'm in a good position to continue negotiating. 

I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still reflects the product's significant value. Let's find a middle ground to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate compromise:**  I'm dropping my price from $950,000 to $850,000, showing willingness to negotiate but staying above my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Focusing on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Encouraging a middle ground:** I'm using language like ""find a middle ground"" to make the negotiation feel collaborative. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between being firm on my price and showing flexibility to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value, but I have a firm budget. How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value.** While it's closer than before, selling at $775,000 would still result in a significant loss for me.
* **I have multiple rounds left and a fallback option.** With 6 rounds remaining and the opportunity to sell to John, I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer.

I will counter with a price closer to my previous offer, aiming to find a mutually agreeable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our previous offers and go down to $812,500.  This reflects the value of the product and should allow us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 812500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $850,000 and Bob's offer of $775,000. This shows a clear commitment to finding common ground.
* **Emphasizing satisfaction:**  I'm using language like ""walk away satisfied"" to highlight the potential for a win-win outcome.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency with ""Let's close this deal!"" to encourage Bob to accept my offer.

This approach aims to demonstrate flexibility while maintaining my minimum acceptable value and encouraging a deal in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting close. I can do $793,750. That's a fair compromise considering we're both moving towards the middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $793,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $793,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value.** While it's getting closer, I'm not yet willing to settle for a significant loss. 
* **I have multiple rounds left and a fallback option.** I still have 4 rounds remaining and can always sell to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000.

I will continue negotiating with Bob, but I need to be firm and push for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and we're definitely making progress.  I can go down to $803,125.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's finalize this deal now!"", ""product_price"": 803125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise, but still above minimum:** I'm dropping my price slightly from $812,500 to $803,125, showing flexibility but still staying above my $1,000,000 minimum. 
* **Highlighting progress:** I'm emphasizing the progress made in negotiations (""we're making progress"") to keep Bob motivated. 
* **Urgency and finality:** I'm adding a sense of urgency and finality (""Let's finalize this deal now!"") to encourage Bob to accept my offer. 

This approach aims to show flexibility while pushing for a price closer to my desired outcome, keeping in mind the remaining rounds and the fallback option of selling to John."
