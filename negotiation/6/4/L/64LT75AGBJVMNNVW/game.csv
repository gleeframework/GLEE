"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price given its value to me. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is a great product, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product, as that's my absolute maximum.  I'm confident you'll still be able to make a good profit at that price, and it allows me to buy the product without exceeding my budget.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one final offer to you: $1,050,000. This is my absolute best price, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
