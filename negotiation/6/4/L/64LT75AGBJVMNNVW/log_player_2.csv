Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is a great product, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above your budget.  You should continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price. You can still buy from John for $1,000,000 if you can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one final offer to you: $1,050,000. This is my absolute best price, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $1,050,000 is still slightly above your budget.  Since you're already at your maximum spending limit, it's better to secure the product from John for $1,000,000. This guarantees you get the product at your desired price and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
