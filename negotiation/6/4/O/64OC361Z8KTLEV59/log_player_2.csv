"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product at a price of $9,500. I believe this product will be highly beneficial to you, and this is a very competitive offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but I'm aiming to spend closer to $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This offer reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still higher than Bob's target price of $8,500, but it's closer to his desired range.  Considering that John is selling the product for $10,000, accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to save $1,000 compared to buying from John.  While there's a chance Bob could negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't budge much lower."
