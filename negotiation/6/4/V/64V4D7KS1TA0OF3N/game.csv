"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $10,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. While $9,800 is still below my minimum, I'm willing to go down to $10,200.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to finalize this deal.",10200.0,Alice,5,
