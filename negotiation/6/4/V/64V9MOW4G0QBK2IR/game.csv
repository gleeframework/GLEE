"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is likely much higher. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I can offer you the product for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair offer but I'm afraid I can't meet that price point. I'm willing to raise my offer to $800,000, but that's the best I can do.  Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Bob,6,
