"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit your business. Given its value to you, I'm extending this exclusive opportunity at a special introductory price of $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However,  $975,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm confident that $925,000 is a fair price for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued interest, Bob. After careful consideration, I am pleased to offer the product to you at $950,000. This price reflects the value you see in the product and provides a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is back to her original offer, and while it's a good deal, I'm hesitant to go through more rounds of negotiation.  I'm concerned that we might end up at an impasse, or that I might have to pay even more than $950,000 in the end.  Buying from John at $1,000,000 ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
