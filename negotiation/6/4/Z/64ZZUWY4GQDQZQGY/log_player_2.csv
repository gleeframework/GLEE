# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! It's a fantastic deal for you at a price of $180. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'm not interested in Alice's offer. The product is worth $150 to her, so it's likely she's making a profit, and I can get it cheaper from John. I'll reject her offer and buy it from John.
