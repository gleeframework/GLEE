``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worthwhile to try and negotiate further to see if you can reach a price closer to your $10,000 target."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. I would like to offer the product to you for $10,800.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,800 is within my budget and represents a good compromise.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll reject my counteroffer, and I'll end up paying more to John.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product for a price I'm comfortable with and avoid the risk of a longer negotiation."
