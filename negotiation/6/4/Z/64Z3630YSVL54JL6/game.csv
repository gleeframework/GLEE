"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the competitive price, but I'm looking to get this product for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,750. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial offer. Would you consider selling the product for $13,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get closer to your initial offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
