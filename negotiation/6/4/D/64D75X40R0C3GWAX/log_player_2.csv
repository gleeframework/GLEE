"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on your needs and preferences. Given its high value to you, I propose a special introductory price of $140. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a product worth $150 at a competitive rate. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is higher than her perceived value ($120), it's still less than your maximum budget ($150) and the alternative offer from John ($150). Accepting this offer saves you $10 compared to buying from John."
