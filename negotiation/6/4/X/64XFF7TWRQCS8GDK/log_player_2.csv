"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $125. It's a steal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $125 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John. You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and securing the lower price."
