Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Initial offer:** I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,700,000. This is above his perceived value but leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Strategy:**  I'm aiming to maximize my profit while considering that Bob may be willing to pay slightly above his perceived value if he wants the product. 
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects my offer, I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer:** While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Strategy:** I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price.
* **Plan B:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option, but I'm hoping to get a slightly better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering Bob with $1,600,000. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer but still above Bob's initial counteroffer and my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Strategy:** I'm trying to meet Bob halfway while still aiming for a profit closer to my ideal.
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm ready to sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer:** Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is too low for me. It's only $150,000 above my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure how much further I can push the negotiations.
* **Strategy:**  It's getting close to my minimum price, but the potential for more negotiation is low.  
* **Plan B:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum profit. It's a safer and more reliable option at this point."
