"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is quite high, considering your budget and her product's worth to her. There's a significant margin for negotiation. By rejecting her offer and proposing a counteroffer, you can potentially secure a much better price.  While John offers a guaranteed price, it's likely you can get a better deal with Alice if you negotiate strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I think your initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer:

* **Presents a significant decrease:**  It drops the price by $200,000, showing you're serious about negotiating but not lowballing. 
* **Provides room for negotiation:** It leaves space for Alice to counter and find a middle ground.
* **Remains above Alice's worth:** It offers her a profit, making it more likely she'll consider the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $900,000 is a strong offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the immense potential of what's on the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, but the price is still significantly higher than both her value and what you're willing to pay.  You have room to negotiate further, and there's no need to jump at John's offer yet. By rejecting this offer and countering again, you increase the pressure on Alice to move closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shows willingness to compromise:**  You're moving closer to her price, demonstrating you're trying to find a deal.
* **Sets a firm but reasonable price:** The $975,000 is a significant step up from your previous offer but still well below her starting point and your maximum budget.
* **Applies a bit of pressure:** By framing it as a ""meet in the middle"" offer, it subtly encourages Alice to make a more substantial move next."
