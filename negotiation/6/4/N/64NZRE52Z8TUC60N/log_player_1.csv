"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. It's also not too far off Bob's perceived value of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is above my minimum, it's still lower than the $95 I initially offered. I believe there's still room to negotiate, and I'm not willing to sell for less than $90.  I'm going to counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm countering with a price of $90.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's last offer and closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for $82.  I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $88. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my desired value. With only 5 rounds left, I need to be strategic and avoid losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, and Bob refusing to budge much higher than $82, I'm running out of time and negotiating power. It's not ideal, but selling to John for $80 is the best option at this point.  It ensures I don't lose out completely and at least get my minimum value for the product."
