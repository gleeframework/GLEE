Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 99
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $100 as possible, as that's my guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80, so I need to offer a price that's attractive but still profitable for me.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $99 leaves a small amount of wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate further, but still ensures I make a good profit if he accepts outright."
