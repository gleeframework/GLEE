"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1500000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget. While the product might be valuable, I need to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and potentially get closer to a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,500,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This price reflects the value I place on the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I believe the product's value to you is higher than $1100000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1300000. This price still provides a good margin for both of us and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. I need to continue negotiating to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can reach a deal that works for both of us. My final offer is $1,200,000. This price represents the maximum I can afford and is a fair reflection of the value I place on the product.  I'm hoping you'll accept it, as it allows us to close the deal and avoid the need for further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1200000, as it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer it to you for $1250000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, it's still above it. At this point, I've already made my final counteroffer and Alice has rejected it.  Further negotiation would likely just take longer.  It's more efficient to buy from John for $1,200,000 to avoid further delays and potential price increases from Alice."
