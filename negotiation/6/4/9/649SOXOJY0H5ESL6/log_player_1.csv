Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1500000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. This price reflects the value I place on the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can reach a deal that works for both of us. My final offer is $1200000. This price represents the maximum I can afford and is a fair reflection of the value I place on the product.  I'm hoping you'll accept it, as it allows us to close the deal and avoid the need for further negotiations.
