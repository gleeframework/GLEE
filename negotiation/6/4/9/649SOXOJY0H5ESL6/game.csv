"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1500000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1500000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. This price reflects the value I place on the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I believe the product's value to you is higher than $1100000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1300000. This price still provides a good margin for both of us and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can reach a deal that works for both of us. My final offer is $1200000. This price represents the maximum I can afford and is a fair reflection of the value I place on the product.  I'm hoping you'll accept it, as it allows us to close the deal and avoid the need for further negotiations.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1200000, as it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer it to you for $1250000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
