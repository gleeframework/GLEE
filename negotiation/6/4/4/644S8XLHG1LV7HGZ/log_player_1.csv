"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm not comfortable accepting $9,500, as that's significantly below my minimum. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $9,750. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,750 is closer to my goal, it's still too low.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's keep moving towards a deal. I'm willing to come down to $10,250.  This would be a fair compromise, and a good price for you. Let's see if we can close this out."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down further, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'll counter with $10,125. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $10,125 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  With only 4 rounds left, I'm worried that if I keep rejecting Bob's offers, he might get discouraged and walk away.  It's better to take the deal now than risk losing a sale and having to deal with John later."
