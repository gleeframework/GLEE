"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $9,750. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's keep moving towards a deal. I'm willing to come down to $10,250.  This would be a fair compromise, and a good price for you. Let's see if we can close this out.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down further, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'll counter with $10,125. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",10125.0,Bob,6,
