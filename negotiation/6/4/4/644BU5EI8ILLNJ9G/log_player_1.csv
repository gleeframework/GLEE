Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to both you and Bob, there's room for negotiation. Starting at $2,250,000 (a 50% markup) aims high.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even though John's offer is your fallback) creates a sense of urgency and scarcity. This might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.
* **Backup Plan:** You're safe even if Bob rejects the offer because you have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Negotiation is dynamic, and you might adjust your approach based on Bob's responses and perceived willingness to pay."
