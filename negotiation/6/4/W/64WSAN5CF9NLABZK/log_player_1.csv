Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000, given its worth."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $8,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation ($10,000) allows room for potential negotiation.  He might counter-offer, and we could still settle on a price higher than $8,000.
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will buy it for my minimum acceptable price ($8,000)."
