"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial partnership. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's estimated value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes a win-win scenario and focuses on the benefits of the partnership.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being overly aggressive, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer if necessary.

**Note:** I'm aware that selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, but I'm trying to maximize my profit by getting closer to my desired $1,500,000 value.  I believe negotiating with Bob can achieve that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your generosity. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1300000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Floor:** $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, I'm willing to explore further negotiation with Bob. There's still room to increase the price closer to my desired value.

**Next Steps:**  I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my floor value, leaving a small margin for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,300,000 is a good starting point, I need to be closer to $1,400,000 to make this deal work for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000. This would still give you a great deal, and it's the closest I can come to your offer."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but still presenting a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm framing it as a compromise, suggesting a midpoint between our previous offers.
* **Maintaining a Negotiation Stance:** This keeps the dialogue open and shows my willingness to reach a deal.

**Note:** I'm trying to slowly increase the price with each round, aiming to reach my desired $1,500,000, but I'm also aware that selling to John is always an option if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my financial situation, I would like to propose a price of $1325000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your needs while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is an increase, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation Continues:** I believe there's still room to push the price higher, and I'm confident that with a few more rounds, I can get closer to my desired value.

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer again, aiming to increase the price further while remaining open to negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $1,375,000.  This would be a fair compromise, and it brings us closer to an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** I'm increasing the price slightly, but not drastically, to keep Bob engaged.
* **Maintaining the Compromise Narrative:** I continue to emphasize the need for a compromise to reach an agreement.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm still leaving room for further negotiation.

**Note:** I'm trying to find a sweet spot where I can push the price up gradually without pushing Bob away completely.  My goal is to close the deal, but only if it's at a price that's acceptable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. I would like to propose a price of $1350000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise given my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time is Running Out:** While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, we're approaching the middle of our negotiation rounds.  
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe there's still room to increase the price with Bob, as he's already shown a willingness to compromise.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer again, aiming to increase the price further while being mindful of the remaining rounds. I need to find a balance between pushing for a higher price and potentially losing the deal altogether."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,350,000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the value of this product and our ongoing negotiations, I'm willing to drop my price a bit further to $1,400,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:** I'm increasing the price slightly, but not drastically, to keep Bob engaged.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and highlighting the potential benefits of the deal.
* **Show Willingness to Compromise:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a significant compromise to demonstrate my commitment to reaching an agreement.

**Note:** With only a few rounds left, I'm trying to strike a balance between pushing for a higher price and avoiding a stalemate. My goal is to secure a deal that's closer to my desired value while recognizing the time constraints."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a final price of $1375000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the circumstances. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are in Round 8, and only two rounds remain. 
* **Not Enough Time:**  Negotiating further with Bob is risky. It's highly unlikely he'll move much closer to my desired price with so little time.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. It's a safe and guaranteed option.

**Conclusion:**  While I'd like to get a price closer to my ideal value, the risk of losing the deal altogether outweighs the potential gains of further negotiation. Selling to John is the most sensible option at this point."
