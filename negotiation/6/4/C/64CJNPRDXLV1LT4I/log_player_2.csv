"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a special opportunity tailored just for you, considering its significant value to you at $15,000. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. I know I can get it for less, either by negotiating with her further or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?"",
 ""product_price"": 12500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with an offer closer to Alice's value ($12,000) than my maximum ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** By suggesting a price ""in the middle,"" I'm trying to position myself as fair and willing to compromise.
* **Leaving Options Open:** If Alice rejects this, I still have room to negotiate up or consider John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. Let's try to find a common ground. I'm willing to consider $13,000 for the product, which still allows me to maintain a good profit margin while offering a fair price to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but slowly. I'm still holding out hope for a price closer to $12,500. I'll make one more counteroffer before seriously considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. I'm still very interested, but $13,000 is a little more than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to do $12,750? I think that's a fair compromise."",
 ""product_price"": 12750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm offering a price that's a straight split between my previous offer ($12,500) and her current one ($13,000). 
* **Conveying Interest:** I'm reiterating my interest in the product, hoping to signal that I'm serious about buying but just need a slightly better price.
* **Nearing Decision Point:**  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll likely go with John. It's not worth risking losing the product altogether for a difference of just a few hundred dollars."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose $12,900 for the product. This price allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while still being competitive for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not budging much further.  While $12,900 isn't ideal, it's only $400 more than my target price and a full $2,100 cheaper than John's offer. It's time to accept and secure the deal."
