"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $10,500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10200.0,Alice,5,
