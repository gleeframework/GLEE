Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's high demand and value without explicitly revealing your minimum price.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The tone is open for discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While $19,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000), there's a chance he might be willing to negotiate, especially if he believes the product is scarce. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Be prepared to potentially lower your asking price slightly if Bob shows interest but hesitates at the initial offer. However, don't go below your $15,000 minimum."
