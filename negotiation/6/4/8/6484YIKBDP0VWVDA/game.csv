"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle for $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal!",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still hoping to land a little lower.  Would you be willing to consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $9,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal!",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  I'm ready to close this deal if we can agree on $9,100.  What do you say?",9100.0,Bob,6,
