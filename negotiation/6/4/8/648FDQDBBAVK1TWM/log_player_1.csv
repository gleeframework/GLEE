Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and focuses on the value Bob will receive.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm prepared to counter-offer if Bob rejects, and I also have the option to sell to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$9,000 is too low:** While it's better than nothing, $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I still have the option to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  If the negotiation with Bob continues to stall, I can always sell to John for my desired price of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering:** I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but am not desperate to sell at his initial offer.
* **Meeting in the middle:** $10,500 is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm flexible.
* **Maintaining value:** The price is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but allows for some profit for me. 
* **Positive tone:** The message remains positive and emphasizes the value Bob will receive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal today.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $9,500 is closer to my minimum of $15,000, it's still not a price I'm comfortable with. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Bob's ""ready to close the deal today"" language suggests that he may be unwilling to negotiate further. 
* **John is a sure thing:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might not yield a better outcome.

I'm choosing to sell to John because it's the most reliable option to secure a good price for my product."
