"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal today.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
