"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a truly exceptional item. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $2000000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to offer $1300000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1600000, which is $400000 above your offer. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and uniqueness.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $1350000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1350000 accurately reflects the product's value. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to see a more significant movement from your end. I'm willing to consider a price of $1550000, which is a $200000 increase from your last offer. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to increase my offer by $50000, but I still think the product is worth less than $1500000. I'll offer $1400000 for the product. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to consider. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. However, I'm willing to make one final attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll consider a price of $1450000, which is $50000 above your latest offer. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to increase my offer by $25000, but I still think the product is worth less than $1400000. I'll offer $1375000 for the product.
