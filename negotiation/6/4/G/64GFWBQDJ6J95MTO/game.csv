"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,800. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,800 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. I'm prepared to offer $9,800 for the product.  This is a fair price that considers both our positions.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,800. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your flexibility. While $10,500 is tempting, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product. This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $10,250. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your persistence in finding a solution.  $10,250 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further. I'm prepared to offer $9,900 for the product.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal.",9900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,900 is a significant compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one final offer: $10,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10200.0,Alice,9,
