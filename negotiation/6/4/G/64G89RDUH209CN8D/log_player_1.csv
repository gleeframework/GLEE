"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm starting at $1,150,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening with a price that's significantly above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  I want to establish a friendly and collaborative atmosphere. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  By stating that I'm willing to find a price that works for both of us, I'm opening the door to negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize profit:** I aim to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without losing the deal.
* **Be prepared to walk away:**  I have a backup buyer (John) which gives me leverage in the negotiation. 
* **Maintain flexibility:** I'll adjust my offers based on Bob's reactions and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Could you do $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **I have a backup option:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safer choice than accepting Bob's offer, especially with more rounds to negotiate with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer to find a middle ground:**  I'll aim to meet Bob halfway in the next round, but I'll still prioritize getting closer to my desired price.
* **Keep John's offer in mind:** This will serve as a reference point for my counteroffers, ensuring I don't drop too low. 
* **Maintain a firm stance:** I'll be prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is too far below my valuation.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Reiterate my valuation:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth significantly more to me, justifying my price.
* **Emphasize the benefit for both parties:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, making it more appealing to Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* **Keep John's offer in mind:**  This ensures I don't drop too low and end up with a worse outcome than selling to John.
* **Monitor Bob's reactions:**  If Bob is hesitant, I might adjust my next offer slightly lower, but I'll be careful not to go below my minimum.
* **Be prepared to walk away:**  While I'm trying to reach a deal with Bob, I'm still keeping John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer matches my minimum:**  $1,000,000 is my absolute minimum acceptable price, and it's also the price John is willing to pay.
* **No need to risk further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a higher price, and I'm already at my minimum.
* **Time is valuable:**  With limited rounds remaining, it's wiser to secure a deal at my minimum rather than risk losing the opportunity.

**Strategy:**

* **Secure a guaranteed outcome:**  By accepting Bob's offer, I guarantee a sale and a profit of $1,000,000.
* **Avoid unnecessary risk:**  Further negotiation could lead to a lower price or a stalemate, potentially leaving me with nothing. 
* **Focus on maximizing profit:**  Even though I could potentially get a higher price, the risk is too high given the limited rounds remaining and my minimum acceptable price."
