"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This price reflects the value of the product and allows you a reasonable profit. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
