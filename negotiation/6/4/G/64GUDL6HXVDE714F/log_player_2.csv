{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, there's still room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get a lower price.  By rejecting, I can make a counteroffer and try to save some money."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000.  Is there any flexibility in your price to make this deal work for both of us?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, I am willing to negotiate further. I am proposing a revised price of $850,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price considering I was hoping for $800,000.  It's still below my maximum of $1,000,000 and a significant saving compared to buying from John.  It's worth accepting this offer to secure the product."
