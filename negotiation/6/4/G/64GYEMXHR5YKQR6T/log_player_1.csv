"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential return on investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong anchor price significantly above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential return on investment"" aims to frame the price in terms of value rather than just cost. 
* **Gathering Information:**  This first offer is as much about gauging Bob's reaction and negotiation style as it is about closing the deal immediately.  His response will provide valuable information for subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 as a starting point.  This price reflects the product's potential while remaining within my financial constraints.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is above his perceived value, indicating a willingness to negotiate. However, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter in the next round to steer the negotiation closer to my target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is understandable, the product's value is firmly above that level.  I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This price reflects a more realistic compromise considering its potential benefits for your business."", 
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial price to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same. 
* **Holding Firm:** However, my counteroffer remains well above both Bob's offer and my minimum price.  This signals that I'm serious about the product's value and not desperate to close the deal at any cost.
* **Justification:** Again, I'm emphasizing the ""potential benefits"" to frame the negotiation in terms of value rather than just price.
* **Observation:** I'm closely watching Bob's responses to gauge his commitment and adjust my approach in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand the value you place on the product, $1,950,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping we can find a way to bridge the gap between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, which is a positive sign. However, $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to incentivize him to move closer to my range.  Rejecting this offer maintains a firm stance on the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To meet you halfway, I'm prepared to make a significant adjustment. Let's settle this at $1,700,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal considering the product's value and potential benefits for your specific needs."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm signaling that this is my last concession, adding a sense of urgency to the negotiation.
* **Compromise (with a caveat):**  While the message frames this as ""meeting halfway"", $1,700,000 is still closer to my previous offer than Bob's. This maintains a strong position. 
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating the value proposition but tailoring it to ""your specific needs"" to further appeal to Bob's potential gains.
* **Preparedness to Walk Away:** By stating this as my final offer, I'm preparing Bob for the possibility that I'll walk away and sell to John for my desired price. This might encourage him to make a more substantial move if he's truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,700,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer. I believe this reflects the product's value while remaining within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's also a risk of Bob walking away. Accepting this offer guarantees I achieve my primary goal of selling the product for no less than its value to me."
