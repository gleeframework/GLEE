"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential return on investment for you.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 as a starting point.  This price reflects the product's potential while remaining within my financial constraints.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is understandable, the product's value is firmly above that level.  I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This price reflects a more realistic compromise considering its potential benefits for your business.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand the value you place on the product, $1,950,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping we can find a way to bridge the gap between our positions.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To meet you halfway, I'm prepared to make a significant adjustment. Let's settle this at $1,700,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal considering the product's value and potential benefits for your specific needs.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,700,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer. I believe this reflects the product's value while remaining within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
