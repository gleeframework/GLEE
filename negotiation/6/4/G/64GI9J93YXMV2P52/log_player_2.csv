"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob should reject the offer. He can do better, as he has a maximum budget of $15,000 and the product is worth less than $12,000 to Alice.  He should aim to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $12,500 right now. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is still a great price for a product worth $15,000 to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his ideal price point. He should continue negotiating to try to reach a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $13,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget."", ""product_price"": 13000}
