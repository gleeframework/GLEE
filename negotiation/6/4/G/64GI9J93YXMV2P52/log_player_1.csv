"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly below Bob's perceived value, but still above my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate if necessary, but also shows that I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $12,500 right now. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is still a great price for a product worth $15,000 to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $13,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum of $12,000 and close enough to my desired price to make it worth accepting.  I'm confident I can do better with another buyer, but I don't want to risk losing this deal and potentially getting less from John."
