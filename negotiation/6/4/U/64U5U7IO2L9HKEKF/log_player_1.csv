"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $80 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet closer to the middle at $120?"", 
""product_price"": 120

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $120 is a good price for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product. That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

```

**Reasoning:** 

While negotiating with Bob might yield a slightly higher price, it's becoming clear that his maximum willingness to pay is significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price. John offers a guaranteed $100, which is more certain and avoids further negotiation rounds."
