"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  This price will likely be rejected, but it sets the stage for a negotiation. It also lets Bob know that I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to try and push for more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I still believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise and within my acceptable range. While I initially aimed higher, the negotiation process is time-consuming, and I don't want to risk losing out on a good deal by continuing to haggle.  Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the potential of further rejections or a last-minute sell to John for a lower price."
