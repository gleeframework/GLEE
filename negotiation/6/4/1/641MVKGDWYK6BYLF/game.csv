,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to buy it for $100.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is firm at $100.  If you're not willing to go that low, I might need to look at other options.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on $100, but I'm not willing to give up on the deal just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $115, which is a significant discount from my original offer. I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $115 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm firm on $100, and if you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to move on to other options.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $110, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,7,
