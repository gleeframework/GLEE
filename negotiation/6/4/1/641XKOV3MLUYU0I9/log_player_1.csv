Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the product's value to me to create a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he doesn't buy it.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, knowing that I have a backup buyer willing to pay my minimum price. 
* **Flexibility:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I'm prepared to negotiate further. I'm confident I can get a price closer to my desired $1,500,000 through counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I still feel there's room for negotiation. How about we aim for a price closer to $1,300,000? I understand this is still above my initial budget, but I believe it would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum of $1,500,000, I'm still not willing to accept it.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price. Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and I believe I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,350,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate further.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm proposing a compromise by suggesting a price that's halfway between our last two offers. This shows a willingness to find common ground. 
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the new price to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Mutually Beneficial:** Highlighting a ""mutually beneficial"" agreement can make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, even though it's higher than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're able to continue our discussion, Alice. I've considered your offer carefully, and while it's an improvement, I'd like to propose a price of $1,325,000. I believe this brings us closer to a fair compromise without exceeding my budget significantly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer is only $25,000 higher than his previous offer.  While we're close to my minimum, I'm not confident I can get a higher price from Bob.  He's showing a pattern of only offering small increases, and I'm risking a stalemate.

It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed offer from John. I'll get a higher price, and I'll avoid further negotiation with Bob."
