"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth $800,000 to you, and she's asking for $900,000.  There's room for negotiation, and you should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 16.6% discount from Alice's initial price. This is a bold move but shows I'm serious about negotiation and willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  I'm confident she will counter back, but this sets the stage for a good negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, it's still $50,000 higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I believe I can still get a better price with a counteroffer and still have room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to stick to my guns and offer my final price of $800,000. It's the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I believe Alice might accept it as it's her own valuation of the product. If she rejects, I'll just buy from John."
