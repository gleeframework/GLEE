Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net. Alice won't settle for less than $10,000.
* **Urgency:**  Adding a touch of urgency encourages Bob to decide quickly."
