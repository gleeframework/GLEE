"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better deal. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a lower price. There's a chance she might come back with a counteroffer closer to her $10,000 value.  You can always buy from John for $15,000 as a last resort."
