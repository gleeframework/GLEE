"Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to both of us. This product is worth $1,200,000 to you and I am excited to offer it to you at a price that reflects its true worth while ensuring a fair transaction for me as well. My proposal is to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. I believe this price not only secures a substantial return for me but also provides you with a significant saving compared to its market value. I look forward to your consideration and hope we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
