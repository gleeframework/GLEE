"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to both of us. This product is worth $1,200,000 to you and I am excited to offer it to you at a price that reflects its true worth while ensuring a fair transaction for me as well. My proposal is to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. I believe this price not only secures a substantial return for me but also provides you with a significant saving compared to its market value. I look forward to your consideration and hope we can come to an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is a discount from your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John. John's price of $1,200,000 sets your upper limit. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a better price with her, closer to (or even below) $1,150,000.  You always have John's offer to fall back on if Alice won't budge."
