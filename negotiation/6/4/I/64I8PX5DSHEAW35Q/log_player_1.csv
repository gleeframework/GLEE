Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $800,000.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a strong offer ($925,000) leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the product's value to Bob, you provide a reason for the offer, making it more likely for him to accept.
* **Alternative:** If Bob rejects the offer, you still have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, ensuring you don't lose out."
