"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.  Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a great product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to consider my offer?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $850,000? That's still a good value for you, and it gives us both some room to work with.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from $900,000, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your continued interest. While $775,000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $812,500? This gives us both a good deal and lets us move forward.  Let me know what you think.",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your point, but $812,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $790,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to meet me here, I'd be happy to move forward with the deal.",790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm starting to feel like we're going to hit a stalemate here.  $790,000 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  If you can go up to $800,000, we can finalize this deal.  But if you can't meet me there, I'll have to look at other options.  I value your business, but I also need to ensure a fair return for my product.",800000.0,Alice,7,
