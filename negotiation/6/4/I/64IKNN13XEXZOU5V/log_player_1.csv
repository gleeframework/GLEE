Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay my minimum acceptable price ($150), there's no incentive to offer the product to Bob for less. I start by offering it at my desired price.  

* **Best Case:** Bob accepts the $150 offer.
* **Worst Case:** Bob rejects the offer, and I sell it to John for $150, still achieving my goal."
