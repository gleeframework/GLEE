"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but not so high that it's likely to scare Bob off immediately.  I want to see how interested Bob is in the product before making any major concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is way too low. It's much less than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with $175. This is still a decent profit for me, and it's a more reasonable price for Bob than my initial offer. I'm hoping this will be a starting point for a more productive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not worth selling for.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $160. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, and this is a good compromise between my desire for a higher price and the risk of Bob walking away.  I'm hoping this price will be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $120 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still going to reject it.  I have a few rounds left and I'm hoping to get a better deal.  If I don't, I'll always have the option to sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $140. We're getting close to the end of the negotiations, and I need to make a decision. This price is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's a significant concession. I'm hoping Bob will finally accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price that I'm going to accept it. I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to sell to John for a lower price."
