"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I see the value in the product, I'm only comfortable going as high as $850,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $900,000. How about we split the difference and go with $875,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $890,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",890000.0,Alice,5,
