"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still very confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we settle at $900,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $1,050,000. This is the best I can do, but I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  While $1,050,000 is still a bit high, I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000 to show I'm serious about making this deal happen.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $1,025,000. This is the best I can do, but I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. Let's close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,8,
