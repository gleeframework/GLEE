"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, however, I believe the price point is a bit high for my budget.  I would be willing to offer $650,000 for the product.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective on the price, the  $650,000 offer is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This offer reflects a considerable compromise on my end and I hope it demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. That said, the current offer is still a bit outside my budget. I could meet you halfway between our previous offers at $812,500.  Let me know what you think.",812500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, coming closer to the middle ground makes sense.  How about $900,000? This shows I'm serious about making this deal work, but also reflects the value this product brings.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate. $900,000 is close, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Could we settle at $850,000? I believe that is a fair offer considering the value and keeps this deal within what I can afford.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your budgetary constraints, and I want to see us reach an agreement. Let's split the difference â€“ $875,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial asking price, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,7,
