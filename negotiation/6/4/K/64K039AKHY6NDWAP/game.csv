"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it. This reflects the value I place on the product, and it would be a fair price for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $600,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $750,000. This is a compromise between our initial offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $750,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $675,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement. What do you think?",675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to go down to $675,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $725,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $700,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and the progress we've made in the negotiation. Let's work towards a final agreement.",700000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to go down to $700,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,7,
