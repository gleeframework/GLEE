"Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with the $75 offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price!",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",85.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $85 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $92. I think this is a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the price!",92.0,Alice,5,
