Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $9000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while still giving me a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
