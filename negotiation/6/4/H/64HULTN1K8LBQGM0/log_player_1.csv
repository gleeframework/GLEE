"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still below Bob's perceived value. This should leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a good price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. I'm confident that I can negotiate a price closer to my desired $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a high price. This shows flexibility while also demonstrating my willingness to negotiate."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price, and I'm not ready to settle for this offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway this round. I'm confident that I can secure a deal at this price, and I'm not willing to go any lower than this. I'm also aware that we only have 5 rounds remaining, so I need to start closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm running out of time, I'm still not willing to accept Bob's offer. I believe that I can push him to accept a price closer to $900,000.  There's still potential for a better deal, and I'm not ready to settle for this low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

I'm making a final concession to meet Bob halfway. This is a fair price considering the remaining time and the risk of losing the deal altogether. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting late, and Bob is not budging much. I'm left with a tough decision.  While I prefer to sell to Bob and get a higher price, it's getting risky.  I'm afraid of running out of time and ending up with a lower price.  

I've decided to accept John's offer. While it's not ideal, it's a guaranteed sale and guarantees me a price above my minimum acceptable price.  It's the safer option at this point."
