"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $120 for it. This price reflects not only its worth but also the opportunity for you to experience its exceptional features. I'm confident it will meet and exceed your expectations. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer ($120) is above your limit:** Your maximum budget is $150, and John offers the product for that price. While Alice's offer is tempting, it's not worth going over budget for.
* **Room for negotiation:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that the price is too high. Alice might be willing to lower it to make a sale. 

Let's see if Alice comes back with a better offer!"
