"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My starting price is $150. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $150, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport with Bob.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the product's value to pique Bob's interest without revealing too much. 

**Strategy:** I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he's not, I'll use the next few rounds to gauge his interest and potentially adjust my offer. If he's not interested at all, I have the option to sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer of $120 is better than John's $100, it's still below my desired price range. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I don't want to settle too quickly.
* **Testing Bob's Interest:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can gauge his level of interest and see if he's willing to come up further.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $135? It's still a fair price for the quality of this product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial price of $150, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality to justify my price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Strategy:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my desired range while still giving Bob a good deal. I'll use the next rounds to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure about the price. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but $135 is a stretch for me. Can you meet me at $125? I'm really interested in the product, and I'd like to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Deal:** Bob's offer of $125 is close to my desired price range and significantly higher than John's offer of $100. It's important to balance maximizing profit with closing the deal within the limited rounds.
* **Bob's Interest:** Bob has shown clear interest in the product, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate. 

**Strategy:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a successful sale and a good return for the product. While I could potentially get a slightly higher price, there's always the risk that further negotiations could lead to a stalemate or Bob backing out completely."
