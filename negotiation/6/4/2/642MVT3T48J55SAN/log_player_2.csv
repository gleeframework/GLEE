# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you and I'm happy to make you a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great price considering the value it will bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is much higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It makes the most sense to go with John."
