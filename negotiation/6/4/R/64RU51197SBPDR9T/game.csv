"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to do $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $110. This is my final offer. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get as much as possible, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $107, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. ",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I get you're trying to find the best deal, but $107 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $108.50? This feels like a fair price for both of us.",108.5,Alice,5,
