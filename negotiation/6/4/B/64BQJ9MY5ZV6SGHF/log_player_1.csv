Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum but still potentially attractive to Bob.  This allows room for negotiation if he counteroffers, and gives me a chance to see if he's genuinely interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but it's clear he's interested. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $110 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $115? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high. How about $108? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $108 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again - how about $112? It's a fair compromise and I believe we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110.5
