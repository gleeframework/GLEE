"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great opportunity for you to get this product at a fantastic price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
