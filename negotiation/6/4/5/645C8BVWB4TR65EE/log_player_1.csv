Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $130. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($150) to aim for a higher profit margin. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $130 offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate or counteroffer, keeping him engaged in the process.
* **Backup Option:** I'm aware I can sell to John for $100, which acts as my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $100 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my absolute minimum:** Accepting $100 would mean I gain nothing beyond the product's minimum value to me.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob's willingness to negotiate suggests there might be room for a price higher than $100.
* **Calculated risk:** By rejecting, I'm betting Bob values the product enough to counteroffer again, but I'm prepared to sell to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115?"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By coming down to $115, I'm signaling flexibility and willingness to make a deal.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  This price point keeps me above my minimum acceptable price while leaving room for Bob to potentially negotiate further.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help me gauge how much Bob truly values the product and how far he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $110 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise given its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** While not the highest potential profit, $110 is a reasonable gain above my minimum price.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further haggling might alienate Bob or lead to an impasse, risking the sale altogether.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing negotiations means potentially losing the chance to sell to John at $100 if talks break down."
