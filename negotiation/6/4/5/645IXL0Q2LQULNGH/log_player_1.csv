"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting with a high number, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point, potentially influencing Bob to counter with a higher offer than he might have initially considered.
* **Leaving Room:**  We know Bob values the product at $800,000 and we have a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 from John. Our initial offer is significantly above both, allowing for negotiation downward while still aiming for a strong profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in your product. I appreciate the value it holds, but I am looking to keep the investment within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is now above his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. We have room to negotiate and should aim higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. However, the value of this product to your business goes far beyond that figure. I'm confident it can significantly impact your operations. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This offer reflects the true value of what this product brings to the table."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  We're lowering our initial asking price to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight Value:**  Instead of simply haggling over numbers, we're emphasizing the product's benefits to Bob's business. This helps justify the higher price.
* **Strategic Concession:** The price drop is significant but still keeps us well above both Bob's valuation and John's offer. We're aiming to keep the negotiation moving while preserving our potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still seeking a price closer to my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeds John's Offer:** Bob's offer is now $100,000 higher than what John is guaranteeing. 
* **Strong Profit:**  While not our initial target, $1,600,000 is a significant profit margin.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a much better offer from Bob, and there's always the risk of him walking away. It's often better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it."
