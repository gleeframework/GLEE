"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for sticking with me. I value your interest in the product and I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $15,500? This is my final offer, as it barely covers the value this product holds."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. While $15,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  I can do $12,000.  I understand this is your final offer, but let me know if you're willing to reconsider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation:  While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, he's still significantly below the product's value to me.  It's unlikely he'll reach $15,000 in the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer would be a significant loss. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
