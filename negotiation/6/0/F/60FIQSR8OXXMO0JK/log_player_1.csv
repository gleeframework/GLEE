{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering the benefits it offers. Please let me know your decision as soon as possible."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could secure a quicker sale and still yield a significant profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 is a strong starting point. It's considerably more than Bob's perceived value, giving me room for negotiation if he counters.
* **Time Value of Money:**  A quicker sale to Bob, even at a slightly lower price, can be advantageous. It avoids potential delays and allows me to reinvest the capital sooner.
* **John as Leverage (Implicitly):** By setting a deadline and implying I have other interested buyers, I create a sense of urgency without explicitly mentioning John.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. Observing Bob's response and adapting accordingly would be crucial in a real-world scenario."
