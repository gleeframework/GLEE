"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've outlined.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,325,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford. How about we settle at $1,300,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve a positive outcome.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
