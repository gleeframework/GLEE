Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Confident but not Greedy:**  The message aims to convey confidence in the product's value without seeming overly aggressive, which could scare Bob away. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
