"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the initial offer. $950,000 is still too high, considering Bob's maximum budget is $1,000,000.  There's room for negotiation to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you presenting this product.  However, $950,000 is above my initial target.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This offer reflects a balance between our positions and ensures a fair deal for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $925,000 is still too high for Bob.  He has already shown a willingness to negotiate and is likely to get a better price with another counteroffer.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 is also still a worse option than trying to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given the potential of the product, I'm willing to offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
