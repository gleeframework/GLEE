Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $15,000 is still too high for me. I've already been negotiating for a while, and I don't think there's a good chance of getting her down to my target price. Since I have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000, it's the most sensible decision to accept his offer and avoid further negotiations."
