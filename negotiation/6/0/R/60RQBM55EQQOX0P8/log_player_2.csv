"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product.
* Alice is offering the product for $90, which is still within your budget.
* However, you want to save as much money as possible. 
* Since you can get the product from John for $100, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John will save you $10."
