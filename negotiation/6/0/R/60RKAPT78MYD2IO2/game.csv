"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to work with me. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,750. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement.",8750.0,Alice,3,
