"I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $160? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $160. How about we meet at $140?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $140, but I'm still open to negotiating. How about we meet at $155? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $155 is the best price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $145, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $155 and $145, which would be $150. It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with it.",150.0,Alice,7,
