Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my desired value. If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and consider whether it's worth continuing the negotiation or simply selling to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,800,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired value. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm countering with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  If Bob accepts, we have a deal. If he rejects, we'll continue the negotiation, but I'll be ready to accept his next counteroffer if it's close to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly higher than selling to John and is close enough to my counteroffer that further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a much better result."
