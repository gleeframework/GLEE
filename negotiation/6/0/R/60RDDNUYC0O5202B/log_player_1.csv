Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn as much as possible. Since we know Bob values the product at $1,200,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price from John, we want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,450,000 vs. $1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:**  By framing the price as a reflection of the product's ""value and potential,"" we provide a reason for the higher price without directly revealing our hand.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is not a hard sell. It invites Bob's feedback and implies a willingness to discuss the price further.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, Alice can adjust her price during the negotiation.  The key is to find a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale."
