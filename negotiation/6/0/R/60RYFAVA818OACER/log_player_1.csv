"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is $2,000 higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** I'm emphasizing the value for Bob and being optimistic about a successful deal.
* **Room for compromise:**  I'm leaving room to potentially drop the price if necessary, but I'm not starting too low. 
* **John as a backup:**  Having John as an option keeps the pressure on Bob to make a deal within the next 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I really like the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $11,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and leaves me with very little profit.
* **Negotiation potential:** I still have 8 rounds to negotiate with Bob and hopefully get closer to my desired price.
* **John as a fallback:**  The option to sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage and keeps Bob from feeling like he can just wait me out. 

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $13,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's fair for me.  Let's find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $14,000 to $13,000. This demonstrates good faith.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone, aiming to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Value proposition:**  I'm still emphasizing the value Bob will get from the product, hoping to sway him toward accepting a price closer to my desired value.
* **Focus on a ""fair"" deal:**  I'm framing the offer as being ""fair"" for both of us, trying to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will get Bob closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but I'm still a bit shy of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob has come up from his initial $11,000 offer, $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** I still have 6 rounds left, giving me ample time to try to negotiate a better price with Bob.
* **John as a safety net:** Selling to John for $15,000 ensures I don't lose out completely, giving me a fallback option in case the negotiations fail.

I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to close the deal within the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but  $13,500 is the lowest I can go right now.  Let's see if we can make this work.  I'm confident you'll find the value of this product well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm acknowledging Bob's compromise by offering a price that's halfway between my last offer ($13,000) and his offer ($12,500). This shows flexibility.
* **Maintaining firm ground:** I'm not dropping to $12,500 yet, as that's still below my desired value.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm again emphasizing the product's value, hoping to persuade Bob to see it as worth the slightly higher price.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** With only 5 rounds left, I'm starting to put more pressure on Bob to make a deal.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will push us closer to a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a fair price. How about we meet at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob has finally met me at my previous offer of $13,000. This is a good compromise for both of us.
* **Time pressure:** With only 4 rounds remaining, there's a risk of the negotiation stalling, and I might need to sell to John, which is less ideal.
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even though this deal is not at my ideal price, it allows me to establish a good relationship with Bob. This could lead to future deals with him where I can potentially get a better price.

While I'd prefer to sell for closer to $15,000, accepting Bob's offer at $13,000 is the best strategy in this situation, considering the remaining rounds and the option to sell to John."
