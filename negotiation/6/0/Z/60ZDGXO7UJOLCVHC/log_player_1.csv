Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Can we meet in the middle at $157.50?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $157.5

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $157.50 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we settle on $162.50? That's still a great deal for a product worth $150 to you, and it's closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 162.5}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $159.75. 
You have three options:
