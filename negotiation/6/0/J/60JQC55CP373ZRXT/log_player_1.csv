Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $95 is more than your minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **It's below John's offer:** This gives Bob some incentive to negotiate with you instead of just waiting for you to sell to John. 
* **It's not too high:** $95 is likely to be within Bob's perceived value of $80, making him more likely to consider the offer. 

By offering a lower price first, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially open up a negotiation where you can maximize your profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only do $85. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you coming down. $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $87.50.  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, $87.50 is still below my target. I'm going to reject his offer and try for one more counteroffer to see if I can get him closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $87.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $89.  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 89}
