"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $120. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good starting point, you can definitely get a better deal.  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $120 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm ready to pay $85 for the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** You're starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still above your maximum price.
* **Negotiation space:** This gives Alice some room to counter without feeling like she's giving away too much.
* **Your limit:** $85 is still a good deal for you, and you've only used one round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $95 for the product. This is a bit closer to your budget while still allowing us to reach an agreement. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $95 is closer to your budget, but you're still determined to get the product for as low as possible. You can likely negotiate further, especially since you haven't used many rounds yet and have the option to buy from John for $80 as a backup.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $95 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  This shows you're being reasonable and willing to meet halfway.
* **Maintaining pressure:**  While you're closer to Alice's price, you're still not at your limit, keeping the negotiation going.
* **Positive tone:**  The message maintains a friendly tone to keep the conversation positive."
