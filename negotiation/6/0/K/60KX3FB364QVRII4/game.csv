"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is my final offer, so I'd appreciate it if you could consider it seriously.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers at $1,000,000. This is a fair offer considering the value of the product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not ready to sell at $1,000,000 just yet. I'm willing to consider $1,050,000, which is a slight increase from your offer. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value and is a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price that reflects the product's value. How about we settle at $1,025,000? This is a compromise I'm comfortable with, and it gets us closer to a deal.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your latest offer, but I'm still not quite there. I can do $1,075,000, which is a slight increase from your offer. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value and reflects its worth to me.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,037,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal soon.",1037000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,062,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal soon.",1062500.0,Alice,9,
