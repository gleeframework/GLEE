"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really appreciate.  I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still lower than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low just yet. How about $110?  That gives us both a little room to be happy."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
