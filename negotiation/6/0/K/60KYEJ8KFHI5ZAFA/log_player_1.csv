{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000.  Bob's offers have been consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and we seem to be stuck in a negotiation loop. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation that might not yield a better result."
