Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** This gives Bob a chance to get a good deal.
* **It's below your backup offer:** This ensures you still make a profit if Bob rejects. 

This strategy gives Bob an incentive to negotiate, but also allows you to secure a good price if he's not interested."
