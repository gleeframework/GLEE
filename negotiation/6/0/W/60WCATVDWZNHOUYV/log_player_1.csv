Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, my goal is to maximize my earnings. $7,500 is below my minimum threshold of $8,000. I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm offering you the product for $9,000. This is still a fair price for both of us, considering its worth to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation. While I would prefer to get more, Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum threshold and matches what I can get from John.  It's best to accept and secure the sale.  There's no guarantee that further negotiations will yield a better price, and I risk losing both buyers if I continue."
