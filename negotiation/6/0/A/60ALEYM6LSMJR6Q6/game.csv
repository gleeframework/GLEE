"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, I find the price a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,100,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we settle at $950,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
