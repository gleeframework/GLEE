"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more around $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit short of my target.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, as my last offer.  This is a fair price considering the value to you, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
