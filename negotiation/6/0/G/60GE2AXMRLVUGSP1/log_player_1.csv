Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair offer considering its unique features and benefits. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting the price high:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering it at $19,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still likely settle on a price higher than $15,000.
* **Highlighting value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to accept even with the higher price.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a chance to purchase the product."
