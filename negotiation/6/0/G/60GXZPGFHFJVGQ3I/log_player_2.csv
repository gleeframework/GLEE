"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John is offering.  It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I'm interested, $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and helps me understand her bottom line.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message remains positive and expresses continued interest in the product. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $8,000 is a starting point. I'm aiming to pay less than John's price ($10,000) if possible, but I'm prepared to negotiate upwards."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but $12,000 is still more than I want to pay and equal to her product's worth. I know I can get it for $10,000 from John. I'll try to negotiate a bit further, but I'm prepared to walk away and go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still a little higher than I'd hoped. Would you consider $9,500? I'm ready to close the deal at that price."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** I'm suggesting a price closer to the middle of our last two offers, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Sense of Urgency:** I'm implying I'm ready to buy now at this price, which might encourage Alice to agree.
* **Below John's Price:**  I'm still aiming to pay less than what John is offering. 
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** If Alice doesn't budge significantly, I'm ready to accept John's deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're still interested in the product. I can see you're willing to pay $9,500, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $12,000, which is $10,750. Is that a price you'd be comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to go below $10,750, which is more than John's offer of $10,000. There's no point in further negotiation. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John to get the best price."
