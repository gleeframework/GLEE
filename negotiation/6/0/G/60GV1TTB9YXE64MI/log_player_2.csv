"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product! After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than the product's worth to Bob, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $800,000 saves Bob $300,000."
