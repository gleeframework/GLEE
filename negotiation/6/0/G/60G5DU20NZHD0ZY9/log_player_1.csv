While we didn't reach $875,000, accepting Bob's offer of $860,000 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable Deal:**  $860,000 is still a significant profit margin over our minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  We're approaching the end of negotiations, and it's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer beyond this point.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob altogether, forcing us to accept John's lower offer. Accepting now secures a good profit."
