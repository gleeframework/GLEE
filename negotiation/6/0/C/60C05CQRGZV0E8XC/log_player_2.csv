Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to accept $900,000.  While I understand your budget constraints, this price doesn't reflect the true value of the product.  Consider the potential benefits it holds for your business - it's a unique opportunity to gain a significant advantage.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?

Round 5

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 still doesn't quite meet my expectations.
