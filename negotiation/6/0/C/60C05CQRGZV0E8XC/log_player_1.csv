Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to accept $900,000.  While I understand your budget constraints, this price doesn't reflect the true value of the product.  Consider the potential benefits it holds for your business - it's a unique opportunity to gain a significant advantage.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This price still allows for a good profit margin for you and ensures I can continue with this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 still doesn't quite meet my expectations. This product is a valuable asset that can bring significant growth to your business.  I'm confident that its value will exceed your initial investment.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I still think $950,000 is a fair price. However, I'm willing to go a bit lower. How about we meet at $925,000? I believe this price is a reasonable compromise that balances both our interests.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. This product offers immense potential for your business, and I believe its true value is closer to $1,000,000.  I'm committed to finding a solution that benefits both of us.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your commitment to finding a mutually beneficial solution. However, I still think $925,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $975,000, which would be $950,000. I believe this price is a reasonable compromise that balances both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I've reached the point where I need to consider selling to John to avoid losing out on a decent profit. Even though I'm not getting my ideal price, selling to John is better than risking further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with an even lower price."
