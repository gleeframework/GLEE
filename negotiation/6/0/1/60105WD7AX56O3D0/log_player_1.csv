{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $915,000, I'm only a few rounds away from potentially getting closer to my desired price. I still believe I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, and I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum goal of $800,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. 

While I was hoping to get a higher price from Bob, we're running out of rounds and I'm not confident I can get him to budge much more.  It's better to secure the $800,000 from John than risk ending up with nothing if the negotiations with Bob fall apart."
