"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth at least $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:** 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price below my minimum.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000. That's still a good price for you, considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've both invested in this negotiation. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This is a good deal for me, and I'm happy to close the deal. While I could try to squeeze a bit more out of him, it's unlikely I'll get a better offer, and the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer is too high."
