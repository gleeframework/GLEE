"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still more than the product is worth to Alice ($8,000), meaning there's room for negotiation.  It's worth rejecting the initial offer and seeing if Alice is willing to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's significantly lowered the price from Alice's initial offer, but still acknowledging the value of the product. This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while also putting pressure on Alice to lower her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our mutual desire to reach an agreement.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to split the difference with Alice. He's moved slightly closer to her offer while still staying within his budget. This shows a commitment to finding a compromise, while also putting pressure on Alice to make a final concession."
