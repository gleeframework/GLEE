"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,300,000 is more than what the product is worth to you ($1,500,000).
* **Potential for a better deal:** You have room to negotiate and potentially get a lower price from Alice.
* **Buying from John is a fallback:** If negotiations with Alice fail, you have a guaranteed option with John, even if it's at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point, significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above the product's worth to her.
* **Room for negotiation:** This leaves room for further negotiation without completely shutting down the deal. 
* **Avoiding a hasty purchase:** By starting with a lower offer, you avoid accepting Alice's price too quickly and potentially missing out on a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:**  $1,280,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Not much room for further negotiation:** While you could try to negotiate further, the difference between Alice's current offer and your target price is relatively small. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If you continue to reject offers, Alice might become less willing to negotiate, or you could end up having to buy from John at a higher price."
