"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $10,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking for a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is your budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,200. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me.",8200.0,Alice,5,
