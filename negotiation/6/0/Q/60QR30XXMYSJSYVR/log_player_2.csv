Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $790,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and she's unlikely to go much lower.  While we could try for a slightly better price, the difference is relatively small now, and we risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting at $790,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's price."
