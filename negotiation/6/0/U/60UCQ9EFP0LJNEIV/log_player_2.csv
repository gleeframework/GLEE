"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a fantastic price, considering its value to me is at least $1200000. I think you'll find it's well worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save a significant amount of money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my minimum value of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1300000. This is still a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?

Considering the value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to profit from the sale.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $1280000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to profit from the sale. What do you think?

Alice's latest offer is still above your budget.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk she'll continue to hold out for a higher price. Buying from John at $1,000,000 guarantees you the product within your budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
