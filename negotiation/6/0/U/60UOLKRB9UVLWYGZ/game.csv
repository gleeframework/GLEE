"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's definitely a great product, and I'm interested in making a deal.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,025,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find a buyer for it.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your hesitation, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $1,015,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1015000.0,Alice,5,
