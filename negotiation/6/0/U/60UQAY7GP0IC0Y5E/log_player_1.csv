{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.
* **Friendly tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This offer allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob, which I can then consider and respond to. 
* **John as a safety net:** I have John as a fallback option, so I'm not overly pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it's a starting point for further negotiation. I can potentially reach a compromise that's closer to my desired price.
* **John is a better option:** Currently, John offers a significantly better deal.  However, I don't want to jump to John's offer too quickly, as further negotiation with Bob could potentially lead to a higher price. 

I'll proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $8,000 is significantly lower than what I need for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000 to see if we can find common ground.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, but I'm also not immediately jumping to John's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate further.
* **Moving towards the middle ground:** My counteroffer of $10,000 is halfway between Bob's offer and my minimum, showing flexibility.
* **Maintaining a friendly tone:** I'm still using a friendly tone to encourage continued negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** This counteroffer is still higher than Bob's offer, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still unable to meet you at $10,000. I am willing to pay up to $9,000 for the product. Is there any way we could come to an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $15,000, but it's significantly closer than his previous offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving me with only John's offer. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing negotiations could drag out the process, and I might ultimately end up with John's offer anyway. 
* **John is a safety net:**  I have John's offer of $15,000 as a backup option, so I'm not under immense pressure to get a higher price from Bob.

Considering these factors, I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer of $9,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise that allows me to sell the product quickly."
