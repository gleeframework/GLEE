"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $1200000.  I'm confident this price will be a win-win for both of us. Let's discuss further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product's potential. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1050000, which would still give you a healthy profit while being more within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can work together on this price.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1050000 is a good starting point, it doesn't fully reflect the product's true value.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1150000.  This price gives us both a fair return on the deal.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product.  However, $1150000 remains outside my budget. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This offers a significant gain for you while remaining within my financial limitations. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
