"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000.  It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  What are your thoughts?",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1750000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1400000.  This is a fair price that reflects the market value, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate the offer. However,  $1400000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000.  This price still provides you with a great value and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can finalize this.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1600000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1500000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal.  Let's find common ground and move forward.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
