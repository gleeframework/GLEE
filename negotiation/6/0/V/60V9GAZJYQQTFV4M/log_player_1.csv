Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I think it's well worth $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. If he immediately rejects it, you can lower the price knowing John is a guaranteed sale at $100. If he counters, you can negotiate from a stronger position.
* **Value Justification:** While not overly detailed here, framing the offer with ""I think it's well worth..."" aims to subtly nudge Bob towards perceiving a higher value.

It's important to remember that this is just an opening move. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
