"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While $13,000 is within your budget, you want to save as much money as possible.
* **You have room to negotiate.** You know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, leaving a significant gap for a potential deal. 
* **More rounds are available.** You have 9 more rounds to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000? That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:**  A $3,000 drop is significant, but still leaves room for Alice to profit.
* **Shows willingness to negotiate:**  The message demonstrates your interest in the product and your desire to find a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Sets a clear target:**  The counteroffer establishes your desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high, but closer.** While $11,500 is better than $13,000, it's still above my target price.
* **More room for negotiation:**  The negotiation is progressing, and there's potential to lower the price further.
* **Rounds remaining:** I still have 7 rounds to negotiate a more favorable price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This would give you a good profit and allow me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but meaningful counteroffer:** $11,000 is a compromise, showing you're willing to negotiate while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Emphasis on fair profit:** Highlighting Alice's potential profit encourages her to accept.
* **Staying within budget:**  The message reinforces your budget constraints."
