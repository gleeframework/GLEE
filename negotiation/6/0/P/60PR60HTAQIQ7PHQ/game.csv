"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000? That's still a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? ",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This would give you a good profit and allow me to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
