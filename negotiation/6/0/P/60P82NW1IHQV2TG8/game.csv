"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,750. Can you consider this compromise?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,750 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down a little more to $10,900. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll consider it.  Let's try to reach a final agreement.",10900.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're making a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,700. Can you consider this final compromise?",10700.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $10,700 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time and offer $10,800. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll agree.  If we can't come to an agreement, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",10800.0,Alice,7,
