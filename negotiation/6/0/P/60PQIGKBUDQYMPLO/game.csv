"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product considering its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to be closer to my minimum. I'm offering you the product for $900,000. This is a good price for both of us, and I believe it's fair considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $850,000 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, offering the product for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away with a good deal.  Let's try to reach a final agreement at this price.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still interested in making a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $860,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If you can meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal. Let's see if we can make it happen.",860000.0,Bob,6,
