Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $15,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $12,000. This gives us room to negotiate.  I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose an offer of $13,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still aiming for a higher price.  $13,000 is closer to my minimum than his, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. How about $14,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and we can close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going down a little, but I'm still staying above my minimum. I want to show Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I am unable to go above $13,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. Although $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to accept it.  I want to see if I can push him a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's settle on $13,500. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering a middle ground between my last offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to get as close to my desired price as possible. I'm also emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose an offer of $13,000 for the product. I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob is unwilling to budge from $13,000. I've already made several concessions and am unlikely to get a better price from him.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me the best possible outcome."
