"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'll sell the product to you for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still too high.  I want to see if I can get a better price. I'm not ready to buy from John yet as his price is my upper limit."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $850,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I'm confident I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating.  I'm not ready to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still above my budget. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $700,000.  It's a fair price, considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'll meet you in the middle again. I'll sell the product to you for $775,000. It's a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $775,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $700,000.  It's a good deal for me considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to Alice.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll reject my offer or stall the process, potentially leading me to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer ensures a good deal and avoids further negotiation."
