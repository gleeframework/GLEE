"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'll sell the product to you for $800,000.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $850,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still above my budget. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $700,000.  It's a fair price, considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'll meet you in the middle again. I'll sell the product to you for $775,000. It's a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach an agreement.",775000.0,Alice,5,
