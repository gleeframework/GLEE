"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm asking for $9,500.  I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
It's better to reject Alice's offer. While $9,500 is under your $10,000 limit, you know you have a guaranteed option to buy it from John for $10,000. There's a chance you could get a better deal."
