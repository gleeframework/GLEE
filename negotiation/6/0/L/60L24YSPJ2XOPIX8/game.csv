"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  I believe this offer balances value with your budget.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $8,500 is still a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,000. It's a fair offer considering my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,000 is cutting it too close. Let's meet in the middle at $7,750. This should be agreeable for both of us.",7750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, I'm sticking to my budget. I can do $7,200, but that's my absolute limit.",7200.0,Bob,6,
