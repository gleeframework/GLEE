"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and might reveal how flexible Bob is willing to be.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly mentions being ""open to discussing further,"" signaling to Bob that this initial price isn't final.
* **Not Too Aggressive:**  While aiming high, we don't want to start at a ridiculously high number that instantly turns Bob off."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price closer to my budget. How about we aim for $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is higher than his perceived value of the product ($8,000). This indicates room for negotiation.
* **Below Our Minimum:** Accepting $10,000 would mean selling below our minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Early in Negotiation:** It's only round 2, and we have time to explore other options before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I can't go as low as $10,000, I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from $15,000 to $13,500, showing Bob we're willing to negotiate.
* **Above Minimum:**  The new price is still safely above our minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Justification:**  We're reiterating the product's value to justify the price, potentially influencing Bob's perception. 
* **Encouraging Movement:**  By moving closer to Bob's range, we hope to encourage him to raise his offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $12,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meets Our Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 matches our minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong Position:** We've successfully negotiated Bob up from $10,000, demonstrating our ability to influence the negotiation.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting this offer guarantees the sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation rounds. While there might be a small chance of getting a slightly higher price from Bob, it's not worth the risk of him lowering his offer or walking away."
