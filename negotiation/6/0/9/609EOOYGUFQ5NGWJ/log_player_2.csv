**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  While Alice's offer is still above her product's worth ($800,000), it's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000.
* **Saving money is the goal:**  As Bob, the goal is to save as much money as possible. Accepting Alice's offer saves $300,000 compared to buying from John."
