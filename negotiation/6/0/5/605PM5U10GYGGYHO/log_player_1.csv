Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a good amount. I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still within a range that Bob might consider (he values it at $100). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This price allows for negotiation and gives me some wiggle room to lower the price if necessary. 
* **Positive Language:** Using phrases like ""good amount"" and ""what do you think?"" helps keep the conversation friendly and open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I'm interested in purchasing the product for $150. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  Bob is offering $150, which is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept for the product.
* **Selling to John doesn't offer a better outcome:**  John is also offering $150.
* **Time and Effort:** Accepting Bob's offer saves me the time and effort of negotiating further."
