{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a price that is still above my minimum value ($120) but leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I can still make a profit by selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering to sell the product for $105. This is still above my minimum value of $120, but it's a compromise from my previous offer.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I can still sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm not willing to go lower, so I'll sell the product to John for $120."
