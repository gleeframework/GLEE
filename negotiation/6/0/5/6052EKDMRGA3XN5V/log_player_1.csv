Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great price considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but below my minimum ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the value he'd receive.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter, keeping the negotiation going.
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects, I can either counter or move on to John for a guaranteed $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $7,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While I could sell to John now for $10,000, there's a chance I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation alive and gives me the opportunity to make a counter-offer that might be more appealing to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your interest,  $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which still offers you a good deal considering the product's value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise price that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly above my minimum.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a good deal for Bob, again emphasizing the value he'd receive.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter, keeping the negotiation going.
* **Plan B:**  I can still sell to John for $10,000 if Bob rejects my counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** While $7,750 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below my desired outcome.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  If I reject Bob's offer and counter-offer, there's a risk that we'll get stuck in a prolonged negotiation, potentially leading to a lower final price or even a stalemate. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation.  The potential risk of getting a lower price from Bob is outweighed by the certainty of a good deal with John."
