"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I believe there's still room to negotiate a better price and I'm not willing to settle for a loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but I'm also confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for less than $150 right now. I believe I can still negotiate a better price or sell to John for my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm finally offering my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a fair price for both of us and it's more beneficial than selling to John for the same amount.  This shows flexibility while still sticking to my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of rounds. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, and it's a more secure option than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
