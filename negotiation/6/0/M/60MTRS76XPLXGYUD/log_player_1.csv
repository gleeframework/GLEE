I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'm also aware of John's offer, so I have a safety net if Bob rejects this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

$800,000 is far too low for me.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a profit significantly above John's offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."

Bob is unwilling to budge on his price, and I'm not willing to go that low.  I'll take John's offer. It's a good price, and I can be sure of a sale."
