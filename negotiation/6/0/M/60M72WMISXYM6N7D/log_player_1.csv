Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering what it could bring you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have room to negotiate above that price with Bob. 
* **High Starting Point:**  $19,000 establishes a strong initial position. It leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price. 
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning a public listing, you subtly introduce a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you are comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. If you want to guarantee a sale (though potentially for less profit), a price closer to $15,000 would be more appropriate."
