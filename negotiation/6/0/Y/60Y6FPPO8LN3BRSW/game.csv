"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its features and benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product looks great, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $10,500? This feels like a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $10,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",10750.0,Alice,5,
