"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $885000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $885,000 is within Bob's budget of $1,000,000 and significantly lower than John's price.
* **Compromise:** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, moving closer to Bob's desired price. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice. Bob gets the product at a good price, saving money compared to buying from John."
