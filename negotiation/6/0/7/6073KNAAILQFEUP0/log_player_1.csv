{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, Bob values the product much higher. Aiming high initially allows for maximizing potential profit.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It shows we're open to discussion while still valuing the product significantly.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  The price point is below Bob's perceived value but significantly above our minimum. It suggests a deal that's good for both parties.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. How we proceed depends on Bob's response. We can adjust our approach if he negotiates or seems hesitant."
