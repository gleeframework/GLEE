"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we settle at $900,000? I think that's a reasonable compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $980,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but that's still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to do $930,000 to make this deal happen today.",930000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $980,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $970,000. This is as close as I can get to your offer without sacrificing my minimum price. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",970000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, I've got another offer on the table, but I'd much rather make a deal with you.  My absolute best is $950,000.  What do you say, can we make this happen?",950000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, and I'm glad you value our negotiation. However, I'm not willing to go below $980,000. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get as close as possible to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",975000.0,Alice,9,
