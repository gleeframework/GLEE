"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be happy to consider a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,225,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'd like to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to make a final offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm offering the product to you for $1,210,000. This is my final counteroffer.
