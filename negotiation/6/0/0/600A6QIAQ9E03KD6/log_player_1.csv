Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14500} 

This offer is slightly below my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I want to get. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to try and meet Bob halfway. This should incentivize him to agree, while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, but it's still not quite there. I'm going to sell the product to John. This way I can get my minimum value and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
