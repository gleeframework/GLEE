Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming to get as much as possible, so starting above your minimum of $8,000 is wise.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Leaving room for negotiation is important. Bob knows the product is worth $12,000 to him, so he has incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  This makes it easy for Bob to understand what you're proposing. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is more than what John is offering, it's still below your ideal price.  You're in a good position to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal.  Let's see if we can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,250? That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you're willing to negotiate, but not drastically lower your price.
* **It's still within your desired range:**  $9,250 is closer to your goal of $10,000 than Bob's offer. 
* **It's a clear and specific offer:**  This makes it easy for Bob to understand your position.

Let's see if this offer gets you closer to a deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for being flexible, Alice.  How about we settle at $8,750? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is not as high as you hoped, it's still a significant profit and better than selling to John for $8,000.  It's also likely that Bob won't go any higher. Accepting this offer allows you to secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiations that could potentially lead to a lower price."
