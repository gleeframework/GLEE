"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to find a middle ground. It's a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, which might make her more willing to negotiate, but it's still above her perceived value of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,250? That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice moved closer to my desired price, there's still room for negotiation. I'll try a counter offer a bit closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for being flexible, Alice.  How about we settle at $8,750? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 8750
}
``` 

This counter-offer meets Alice halfway between her last offer and my previous one. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also holds firm on getting a reasonable deal."
