``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's lower than Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, leaving space for him to counter without feeling pressured. 
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  It shows you're confident in your product's worth and  willing to negotiate."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,450,000. I would like to propose an offer of $1,350,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
