Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above your minimum ($120). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly above Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation if he tries to counter-offer.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120, so there's no risk in aiming high with Bob."
