{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,400,000 is above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room for you to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **It shows you're serious:**  By starting with a strong offer, you show Bob you're not just playing games. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still below what you'd like to get. It's worth pushing for a better price.  You can counter with a slightly lower price than your initial offer,  showing flexibility while still aiming for a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $1,375,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Meet in the middle:**  $1,375,000 is the midpoint between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Stay above your minimum:** You're still above your minimum acceptable price, ensuring a good profit.
* **Maintain leverage:** By not accepting Bob's first counteroffer, you demonstrate that you're not desperate for a quick sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,325,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, but it's still a bit too low.  You're willing to negotiate, but you need to hold firm on your bottom line.  A counteroffer will show Bob you're serious about getting a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go any lower than $1,350,000.  It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's make this deal happen. "", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Stand firm:** You've reached your bottom line, but still  show flexibility by sticking with the middle ground from the previous round.
* **Highlight value:**  You remind Bob of the value he'll get from the product to justify the price.
* **Call for action:** You encourage Bob to close the deal to avoid losing the opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $1,325,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, but the negotiation has reached an impasse. Bob is unwilling to move further, and you've already reached your bottom line.  While $1,325,000 is still a decent profit, it's not as good as you could get from John.  Selling to John guarantees a sale at your minimum acceptable price, ensuring a good return."
