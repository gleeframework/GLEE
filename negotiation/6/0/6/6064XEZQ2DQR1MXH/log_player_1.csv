Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I've done some research and I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is my final offer for today,  let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,500 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
