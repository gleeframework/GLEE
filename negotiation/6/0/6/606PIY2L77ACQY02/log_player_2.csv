"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for your product. It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. This counteroffer is a strong starting point, offering a price that is still above Alice's value but lower than her initial offer. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while showing Bob's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $1,350,000? It's a fair price that still gives you a significant gain. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going.  It allows Bob to potentially get an even lower price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $1,325,000. This price is fair for both of us and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground with this offer. It's a reasonable compromise that shows his willingness to negotiate while still saving a significant amount of money compared to Alice's initial offer and John's price."
