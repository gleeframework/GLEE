Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus you could tap into.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance with Bob before moving on to John.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 might be rejected as Bob has no incentive to negotiate.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Considering its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** Creates a sense of exclusivity and urgency.
* **Price:**  $1,150,000 leaves a potential $50,000 profit for Bob, making it an attractive deal while securing you a $150,000 profit above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your negotiation style and any additional information you might have about Bob, you could adjust the price and messaging."
