"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product is quite high, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. I am willing to pay up to $1500000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I have 9 rounds left and can continue negotiating with Bob or sell to John for my desired price.  It's worth trying to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,500,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to consider.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,625,000?  This would allow me to move forward with the sale while still giving you a significant discount from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 1625000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. I'm willing to consider $1600000 as a potential price for your product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value of the product to me and the cost to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. I have 6 rounds left and can still potentially get a higher price, so it's worth trying to push further.  If I were to sell to John now, I would be getting the same amount as Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While your offer is getting closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your patience. I am willing to consider $1625000 as a potential price for your product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise given the value I place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,625,000 is now above my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial offer, I'm running out of time. With only 4 rounds remaining, accepting this offer ensures I don't risk getting a lower price or having to sell to John for a lower amount."
