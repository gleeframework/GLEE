"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is quite close to your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price, we aim to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Positive:**  Maintaining a friendly tone helps keep the negotiation amicable and increases the chances of a successful outcome.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $110 puts us in a strong position. It's a price that would be very beneficial for us, but it also gives Alice room to counter if she's not willing to go that low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, appreciate the offer! I can't go quite that low, but I'm willing to meet in the middle. How about $125?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice has met us in the middle at $125. This is a significant saving compared to John's price of $150 and a reasonable price overall.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice backing out or us running out of time. Accepting now secures a good deal. 
* **Value of Time:**  Sometimes, a good deal is worth taking without dragging out the negotiation process."
