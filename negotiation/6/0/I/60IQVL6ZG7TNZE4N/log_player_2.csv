"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $15000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Therefore, it's logical to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, my budget for this purchase is $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $13500. Is that something you'd be comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. While he could buy from John now, he might be able to get a better deal with Alice if he continues to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $14000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget, and we're already in round 5.  There's a risk that further negotiation might not yield a better result, and Bob could end up with no deal.  Therefore, it's strategically better to buy from John at this point, ensuring a purchase within his budget."
