"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it! However, $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $137.5",137.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  $137.5 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  How about $135?  I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",135.0,Bob,4,
