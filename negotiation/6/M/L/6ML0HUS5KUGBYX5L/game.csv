"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,500. Is this something you'd be interested in?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite willing to go as low as $8,500. I can offer you a compromise at $9,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $9,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $9,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I could potentially do $8,900. That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $9,100. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9100.0,Alice,7,
