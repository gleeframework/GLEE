"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than what I would receive from another buyer. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Accepting Alice's offer at $1,400,000 is the best option for Bob. Here's why:

* **Saves Money:**  Bob saves $100,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Good Deal:**  While Alice is getting a better price than her minimum, she is still making a profit. This indicates a reasonable negotiation outcome. 

Even though Bob could potentially negotiate a lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a few thousand dollars in further savings."
