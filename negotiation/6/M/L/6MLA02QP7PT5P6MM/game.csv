"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling price.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, but I believe the product's value to you is even higher than that. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. My counteroffer is $1,075,000.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $1,050,000.  Would you consider $1,062,500? This splits the difference between our last two offers and represents a fair compromise.",1062500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still believe the product's value to you is higher than that. I'll come down to $1,075,000 was a bit too low for me, so let's try $1,090,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand your perspective on the product's value, $1,090,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $1,070,000 for the product. This reflects a sincere effort to reach an agreement and is a price I believe is fair considering our previous discussions.",1070000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,070,000. I'll come down to $1,080,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1080000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. While I appreciate the product, $1,080,000 is close to my limit. To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer a final price of $1,075,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can find common ground.",1075000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at the midpoint of our last two offers. I'll come down to $1,077,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1077500.0,Alice,9,
