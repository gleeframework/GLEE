Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the potential gain for Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm using language that implies I'm open to discussing the price further.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000.
* I'm ready to negotiate with Bob and make counteroffers if needed.
* I have a backup plan with John, ensuring I don't lose out on a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This would be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a price closer to my goal.

**Strategy:**

* I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. This will demonstrate that I'm serious about getting a good price for my product.
* I'll aim for a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum acceptable price, while still leaving some room for negotiation.
* I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to remind Bob of its worth. 
* **Open to compromise:** I'm using language that implies flexibility and willingness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Strategy:**

* By staying firm but open to negotiation, I'm increasing the chances of reaching a price closer to my minimum.
* This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating my commitment to a successful negotiation.
* I'm prepared to make further adjustments depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $950,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is unlikely to succeed:** I've already compromised twice, and Bob's counteroffer indicates a significant gap in our expectations. 
* **Time is valuable:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially losing John as a buyer.

**Strategy:**

* It's time to cut my losses and accept the guaranteed deal with John.
* Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation with Bob, who is unlikely to meet my requirements."
