"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?"",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $5,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong opening move in a negotiation. This leaves room to gradually increase the offer while still staying well below your $8,000 maximum. 
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This initial counteroffer will help you understand how much Alice is willing to negotiate. If she's completely unwilling to budge from the $12,000, you can adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's find a middle ground, what do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your budget, $9,000 is still higher than what John offers. There's a possibility of negotiating a price closer to, or even below, $8,000.  It's worth seeing if you can get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a Middle Ground:** This counteroffer shows Alice that you are willing to negotiate and move closer to her price range. 
* **Staying Competitive:** $7,000 is a strong offer that keeps you in the game and gives you a good chance of securing a price lower than John's $8,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering:**  There's still a little wiggle room in your offer if Alice is unwilling to go this low but wants to continue the negotiation."
