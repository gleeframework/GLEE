Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a starting point that is above Bob's valuation but below your minimum.**  This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring you make a profit. 
* **The message is friendly and open to negotiation.** This sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to consider your offer.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to find a middle ground between your minimum price and Bob's valuation. It leaves room for negotiation, allowing you to potentially earn closer to your desired price without risking losing the sale entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $5,000 is significantly lower than your minimum valuation of $15,000 and even your initial offer of $12,000. 
* Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for you. 
* Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price.

**Strategy:**

While selling to John for $15,000 is the most profitable option, rejecting Bob's counteroffer and continuing the negotiation allows you to explore if you can get a better price from Bob. Even if you don't, you still have the option of selling to John as a backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's find a middle ground, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $9,000:** This counteroffer is still above Bob's initial offer of $5,000 but significantly lower than your initial offer of $12,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still protecting your interests.
* **Friendly message:** The message emphasizes finding a middle ground and encourages further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between your desired price and Bob's offer. By demonstrating flexibility while maintaining a firm stance, you increase the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer of $7,000 is higher than his previous offer and closer to your desired price.** While still below your ideal, it represents a significant improvement and a reasonable compromise.
* **Selling to John for $15,000 is the most profitable option, but it carries the risk of a longer negotiation with Bob that could result in a higher price.** 

**Strategy:**

The goal is to maximize profit. While $7,000 is less than the $15,000 you could get from John, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation. The risk of potentially getting a better price from Bob is outweighed by the certainty of a sale at a price that is above your minimum and significantly better than Bob's previous offer."
