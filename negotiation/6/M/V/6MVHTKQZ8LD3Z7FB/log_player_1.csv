{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $100.
* **John's Offer:**  You have a backup offer of $100 from John.

By offering the product at $140, you are:

* **Maximizing Profit:** You aim for the highest price Bob is likely to accept, maximizing your potential profit. 
* **Staying Above Your Minimum:**  You ensure a significant profit even if Bob rejects the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely, Bob could potentially counter-offer, giving you the option to still sell above your minimum."
