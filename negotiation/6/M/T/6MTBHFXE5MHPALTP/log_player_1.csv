Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $11,000 is still more than I had in mind.  Would you consider $7,000? I feel that's a fair offer.

Bob's offer:

Bob is unlikely to go above his maximum valuation of $8,000.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
