"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,200,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the benefits it offers.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $1,250,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and willing to negotiate. He's moved closer to my price, but I'm still aiming for a higher profit.  It's still early in the negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better offer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. Let's split the difference - $1,275,000, and we have a deal. This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your budget considerations."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm aiming to close the deal quickly now.  Meeting Bob directly in the middle is a strong negotiating tactic. It shows flexibility on my part while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my target. How about $1,200,000? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has become firm on his $1,200,000 offer and is unlikely to move much higher.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk he'll walk away or I'll waste valuable time. Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial profit ($200,000 above my minimum) and is a safe choice at this stage."
