"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $800000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1100000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product holds. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice. However, $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $1020000. I'm at the limit of my budget, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. Can you consider this offer?",1020000.0,Bob,6,
