"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I really think that's a fair price for this product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be upfront â€“ I have other interested buyers.  $1,280,000 is my final offer. It reflects the true value of this product.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you have other interested buyers, but I'm not willing to pay $1,280,000. My final offer is $1,250,000, and I'm not budging from that price. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider other options.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
