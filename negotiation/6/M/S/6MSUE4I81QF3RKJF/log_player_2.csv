"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $1,200,000, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This price reflects the value you've stated, but also allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  He can still potentially negotiate a better price. It's also worth noting that buying from John is always an option, providing a guaranteed price below Alice's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'd like to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This price recognizes the value you've placed on it, while still allowing me to make a worthwhile purchase."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your continued negotiation.  I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000. This price is a significant compromise for me, but I'm confident it's a fair reflection of the product's value and allows us both to reach a win-win agreement. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit.  Bob has already rejected multiple offers and has the option to buy the product from John for a guaranteed price of $1,000,000.  This is the best option for Bob at this point to guarantee a purchase within his budget."
