Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. This doesn't mean he's willing to pay that much, but it gives you a target.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer. This is your leverage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your potential profit but not so high that Bob walks away.  

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will deliver significant returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Language:** ""Exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant returns"" create a sense of value.
* **High but Justifiable Price:**  The $1,900,000 is a significant markup, but you're relying on the perceived value and Bob's lack of knowledge about your other offer.
* **Time Pressure:** The ""limited-time offer"" and mention of ""other interested parties"" add urgency, potentially making Bob act quickly.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. You need to be prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob counters too low or seems hesitant."
