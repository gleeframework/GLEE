"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a premium for this unique item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting offer is significantly above your maximum valuation. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,200,000?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is important to keep the negotiation going smoothly.
* **Signaling Interest:**  While the counteroffer is low, expressing continued interest in the product shows Alice you're serious about finding a mutually agreeable price."
