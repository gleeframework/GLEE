"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a significant discount from my initial price, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $18000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my costs.",18000.0,Alice,3,
