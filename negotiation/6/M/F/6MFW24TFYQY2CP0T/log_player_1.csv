{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts at a price significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It also encourages Bob to consider the value of the product and make a counteroffer if he's interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that's a little steep for me. How about we settle at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than my minimum desired price. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference at $11,000? I'm confident this product will be worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice.  I could meet you halfway at $10,750.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal if you agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,750 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob entirely. It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale."
