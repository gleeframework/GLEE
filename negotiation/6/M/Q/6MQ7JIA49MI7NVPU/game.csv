"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but unfortunately, I still can't meet you halfway. I'd like to stick to my budget of $8,000. Could you possibly consider coming down to this amount?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you sticking to your budget, but I'm still not comfortable going below $8,500.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and it's the lowest I'm willing to go.  Consider it a final offer â€“ let's make this deal happen!",8500.0,Alice,5,
