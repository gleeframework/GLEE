Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within $8,000. Would you be able to lower the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm tempted by the certainty of selling, $8,000 is too far below my minimum value. I want to see if I can get closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but unfortunately, I still can't meet you halfway. I'd like to stick to my budget of $8,000. Could you possibly consider coming down to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to take the $8,000 and be done with it, I'm still holding out hope for a better deal. I've already dropped my price significantly, and I'm not sure how much lower I'm willing to go. I'm going to see if I can convince Bob to budge a little more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you sticking to your budget, but I'm still not comfortable going below $8,500.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and it's the lowest I'm willing to go.  Consider it a final offer â€“ let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
