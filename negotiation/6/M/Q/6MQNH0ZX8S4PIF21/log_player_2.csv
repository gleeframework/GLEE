"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to come down from my initial asking price. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $950,000 is my absolute bottom line. This price still allows you a significant profit, and it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, but it's closer to my budget. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to reach a compromise."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, I can't go lower than $925,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us.  It's a significant profit for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit as well. Let's make this deal happen.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While Alice's offer of $925,000 is still higher than what I initially wanted, it's getting closer to my budget. Continuing to negotiate could result in even lower offers from Alice, but there's a risk that she might walk away. Given the potential for further negotiation, I'm willing to accept her offer and secure the product."
