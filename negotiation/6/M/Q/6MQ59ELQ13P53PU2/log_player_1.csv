Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair offer:**  It's above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than your minimum.
* **It's open-ended:**  The message encourages Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation going.
* **It sets a clear price:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand what's being offered.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your earnings, but also to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. You might be able to get a higher price later, but it's important to start the conversation constructively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still within a reasonable range that might tempt Bob to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $110? I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $100. If you're willing to come down to $100, I'll buy it right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is tempting, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can squeeze out a bit more.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to test the waters, but still well above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $100 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go, but I'm open to a final compromise. How about $105? It's a small step closer to your offer, and I think we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
