"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14000. Can you consider it?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is still a bit below what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $16000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for you. Let's try to reach an agreement on this price.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13500. Can you consider it?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $15000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to achieve a profitable sale. Let's finalize this deal at $15000.",15000.0,Alice,5,
