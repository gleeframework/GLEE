"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. $16,000 is still a little steep for me though. How about $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $13,500 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $15,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do. What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,5,
