Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we could offer the product at $1,500,000 (our guaranteed price from John), there's room to negotiate with Bob and potentially earn even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a sense of urgency (limited-time offer) and positions it as a potential bargain for Bob, who values it at $1,000,000. This price also provides a significant profit margin for you. 
* **Backup Plan:** We have the security of John's offer, ensuring we won't settle for less than $1,500,000.

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while mitigating the risk of losing the sale altogether."
