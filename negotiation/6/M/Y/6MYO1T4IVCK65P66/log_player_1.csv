Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm!  While I see the potential in this product, $950000 is a bit too steep for me at this point.  I'm willing to offer $750000 for it, which is still a fair price for its value. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between $850,000 and $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 875000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $825000, which is closer to my budget and still a fair price for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this point.
