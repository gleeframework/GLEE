"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm!  While I see the potential in this product, $950000 is a bit too steep for me at this point.  I'm willing to offer $750000 for it, which is still a fair price for its value. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between $850000 and $900000. How about we meet in the middle at $875000? This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $825000, which is closer to my budget and still a fair price for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this point.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $825000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850000. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to consider $887500, which is a compromise between our two numbers. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere.",875000.0,Alice,5,
