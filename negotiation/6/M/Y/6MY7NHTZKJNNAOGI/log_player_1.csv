Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd love it. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $100 allows room for negotiation and potentially getting a higher price than my minimum of $80.
* **Positive message:** A friendly message encourages Bob to consider the offer and potentially open the conversation for negotiation. 
* **Testing the waters:** This price will give me an idea of Bob's interest level and how high I can realistically go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping for a lower price. Could you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While I could try to counteroffer and push for a higher price, there's a risk Bob might walk away entirely. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and minimizes the risk of losing the deal. 
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate could take time and effort, and selling to John for $80 is always an option if the negotiation stalls."
