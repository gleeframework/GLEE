I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. What do you think?,12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think $9000 is a fair price, but I'm not sure I can go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a deal you can't pass up.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above your new offer. I'm willing to compromise and offer $10500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about this product, and I'm willing to meet you at $10500. However, I'm not quite ready to give up on a higher price. I'll offer you a slight adjustment to $11250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10800. I'll make one more adjustment to $11500. This is my last offer, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment.",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another adjustment, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise and offer $10500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're in a stalemate, but I'm still willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $10500, but I need to know you're serious about this deal. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,9,
