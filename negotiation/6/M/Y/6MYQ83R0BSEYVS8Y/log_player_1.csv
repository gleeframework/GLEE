"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more than that to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a good starting point. By offering a price that is slightly below Bob's valuation but significantly above your minimum, you show that you are willing to negotiate but also value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is tempting, it's still a bit lower than what I think I can get. I'm going to try and push for a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer and appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still hoping to get closer to $10,000.  I'm willing to come down to $9,750. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $9,200. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,200 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I want to see if Bob is willing to go up a bit more. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $9,200 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $9,500.  How about $9,350? This would represent a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9350}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $9,150. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price. It's getting late in the negotiation, but I'm going to counteroffer one more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway this time. How about $9,250? This is my final offer, I'm not sure I can go lower than this."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $9,200. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, it's getting late in the game. I'm worried that if I reject Bob's offer, he might get frustrated and walk away. $9,200 is still above my minimum and a decent profit.  I'll take it."
