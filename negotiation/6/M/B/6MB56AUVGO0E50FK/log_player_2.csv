"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth much more to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you working with me, but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, but still offering a fair price that Alice might be willing to accept.  $100 is a good starting point for a counteroffer.  It's still a profit for Alice, and it gives Bob some wiggle room in future negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm prepared to go down to $110, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is a good price for Bob.  It's still within his budget and a decent deal compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might be possible, but it's risky to keep going.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
