"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations. While I value your interest, $900,000 is a bit too low for me to accept.  Could you consider $1,050,000? I'm confident this price represents a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
