Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal on a valuable item. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You have an advantage knowing Bob values the product at $10,000. 
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a price of $19,000 allows room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's valuation and your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, ensuring you won't settle for less.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize your profit. However, setting the initial price too high might discourage Bob from negotiating at all.  Observing Bob's reaction to this offer will be crucial for deciding your next move."
