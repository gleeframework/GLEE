"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is an aggressive opening offer, but it gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price for the product. Since I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, this initial offer leaves some wiggle room for potential concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, but it still keeps me above my minimum acceptable price.  I hope this will be a more appealing price for Bob, and we can close the deal in this round."
