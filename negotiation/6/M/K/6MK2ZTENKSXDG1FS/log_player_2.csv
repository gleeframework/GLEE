"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your life. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial value of $15,000, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000. You have a better option with John, so rejecting Alice's offer and proceeding to counteroffer is the best strategy. This gives you a chance to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or walk away and buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, my budget for this purchase is $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for 11000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above your maximum budget. While it is tempting to consider it, you have a guaranteed option with John at $10,000. Rejecting this offer allows you to counteroffer again, potentially pushing the price down even further or to simply buy from John with certainty."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, I'm still unable to go above my budget of $10,000. If you're willing to consider that price, I'd be happy to finalize the purchase. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to finalize the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $10,500 is still above your maximum budget of $10,000. While you have been successful in pushing the price down, you now have a guaranteed way to get the product at your budget with John. It's a calculated risk to continue negotiating, as there's no guarantee Alice will come down further. Buying from John ensures you get the product for your desired price without any further risk."
