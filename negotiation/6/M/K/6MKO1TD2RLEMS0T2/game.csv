"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm confident it would be a valuable asset to your business.  I'm starting with a price of $1450000.  This reflects the product's unique value and the potential benefits it can bring to your operations.

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1300000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while staying within my financial limits.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate the counteroffer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1300000 is a bit too far below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm willing to come down slightly.  Let's try $1400000.  This still allows for a profitable deal for both of us and reflects the product's unique benefits.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement if we both focus on finding a mutually beneficial solution.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $1350000 is closer, it's still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1375000. This price recognizes the value you see in the product, and allows us to make a deal without me needing to sell to John.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
