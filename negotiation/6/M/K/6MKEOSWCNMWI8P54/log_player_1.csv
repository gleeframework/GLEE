Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) without losing him to a guaranteed sale with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below Bob's valuation leaves room for potential counter-offers while still aiming high.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** A price of $1,100,000 demonstrates confidence in the product's value without seeming unreasonably greedy. 

This strategy seeks to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale."
