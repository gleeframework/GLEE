"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $9,500. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and this price reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is quite high. There's plenty of room for negotiation to get a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive starting point:** Starting low puts pressure on Alice and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and interested:** Maintaining a positive tone helps foster a good negotiation environment.
* **Justification:**  While not strictly necessary, mentioning a budget constraint provides a reason for the lower offer. 

This counteroffer aims to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a highly favorable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm motivated to sell, $7,000 is significantly below its value.  Could you meet me halfway at $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, moving closer to a price between her valuation and our initial offer. However, $8,500 is still a significant markup from her $8,000 value. We have room to push for a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice. To be fair, I could stretch my budget to $7,500. That's a significant investment for me, but I see the value in the product."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  We're moving in smaller increments now, showing Alice we're serious but not desperate.
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the budget constraint and highlighting the product's value reinforces our position.
* **Strategic positioning:** This counteroffer aims to land somewhere between our previous offer and Alice's last counteroffer, hopefully finding a mutually agreeable price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $8,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met us at her valuation of $8,000. This is a great deal and there's no realistic chance of getting the product for a lower price. Accepting now secures the best possible outcome."
