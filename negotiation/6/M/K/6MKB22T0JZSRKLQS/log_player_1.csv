Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd be very interested in it. I'm asking for $20,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By saying I'm open to negotiation, I'm showing Bob I'm willing to compromise and hopefully encourage him to counteroffer. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** If Bob rejects my offer, I have a backup plan with John, which is why I'm not offering anything lower than $15,000 at this stage.

This strategy gives me the best chance of maximizing my earnings while also being willing to negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the details you've provided. Based on my current budget and the value I see in the product, I would like to propose a price of $15000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would have liked to earn more, accepting his offer ensures I don't lose any money and guarantees a sale. Selling to John would result in the same outcome, so there's no advantage to that option.  Rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering could risk losing him entirely."
