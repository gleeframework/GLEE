"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,250,000. This is a significant discount considering its value to me.  While I'm confident in its worth to you, I'm also willing to sell it to another buyer for $1,500,000 if you decline.  This is a chance to secure a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a discount, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can secure the product from John for $1,000,000, saving $250,000."
