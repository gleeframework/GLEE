"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its true worth.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product.  This price is still well above your value for it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,000,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher, especially considering the benefits it will bring to your specific needs. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as I'm confident it represents a fair and mutually beneficial deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe in the value of this product, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's find a compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the immense value this product holds. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  This demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal while ensuring a fair return on a product that's poised to benefit you greatly.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
