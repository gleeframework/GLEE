"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still more than you're willing to pay. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is closer to your budget, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You're only $10 away from John's price, and it's worth seeing if you can push Alice down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go to $95. That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
