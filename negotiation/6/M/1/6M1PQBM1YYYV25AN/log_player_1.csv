Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not giving away the product for less than you're willing to accept.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** It lays out the price and your willingness to negotiate.

This strategy allows for a potential back-and-forth negotiation, giving you the best chance to maximize your profit while keeping Bob interested in the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That seems a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $80. By rejecting his offer, you maintain your position and open the opportunity to negotiate a better price. You can use the fact that John is willing to pay $80 as leverage during the next round of negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is unfortunately below my minimum price. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $85? This still leaves room for a great price for you, and it's closer to my minimum."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $85 is closer to what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is exactly what John is willing to pay. While it's not ideal to sell at your minimum price, it avoids any further negotiation and guarantees a sale. Accepting Bob's offer provides a quick and certain outcome."
