Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $950,000, which is a significant amount but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Considering Value:** I'm aware of the product's worth to Bob ($1,000,000) and aim for a price close to that value.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This initial offer leaves room for Bob to counter with a lower price, potentially closer to the $900,000 range, which is still beneficial to me.
* **Protecting My Minimum:**  I'm mindful of my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and won't go lower than that.  
* **John as Backup:** I'm aware of John's offer and will use it as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Counteroffer is the best strategy:** I'm confident that I can get a better price than $700,000.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired range.
* **John as a safety net:**  While I prefer to sell to Bob, I have John's offer as a fallback if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm counter-offering with $850,000, which is halfway between Bob's offer of $700,000 and my previous offer of $950,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my minimum.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** This price is still well below the product's estimated worth to Bob ($1,000,000), making it attractive for him.
* **Strategic Approach:**  This counteroffer signals my intention to negotiate seriously but also sets a clear boundary. It allows room for further discussion while minimizing the risk of losing the deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:** Bob's offer of $650,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. It's clear he's not willing to meet my needs.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John's offer of $800,000 guarantees me a price that meets my minimum requirements. 
* **Time is Valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially lowering the final price. 

Selling to John provides a guaranteed outcome and avoids further negotiation with Bob, who has shown reluctance to meet my price expectations."
