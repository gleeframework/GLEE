"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in buying the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will make a counteroffer.  $900,000 is too low, and I can still get a better price from Bob or sell to John."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While I could continue to negotiate with Bob, it's getting close to my minimum threshold, and I risk getting a lower price. John is offering my minimum, and I have no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer. Selling to John is the safest option to ensure I get my minimum desired price."
