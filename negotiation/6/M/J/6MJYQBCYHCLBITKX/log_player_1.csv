Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit margin.  Since I don't know Bob's value, I'll see if he's willing to bite. If not, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but still keep in mind my minimum value of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still hoping to get more. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and see if he's willing to come up a bit more.  If he isn't, I'll consider selling to John in the next round if he rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum value.  I'm comfortable with this price and don't want to risk losing him completely by continuing to negotiate."
