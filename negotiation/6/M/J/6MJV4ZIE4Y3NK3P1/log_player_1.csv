Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This gives me a good starting point above my minimum, and leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more.  I'm also keeping in mind that John is a backup buyer at $12,000, so I can't go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my original asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while also keeping my profit margin reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  While I'm willing to negotiate, his offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing with John."
