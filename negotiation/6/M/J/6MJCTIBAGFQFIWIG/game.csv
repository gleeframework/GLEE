"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $17,000 for it,  given its value to me. Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. However, I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $18,500. It's a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you.",18500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $18,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $17,500? It's a fair price that considers both our positions.  ",17500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $17,200. It's the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",17200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,200 is still a bit high for me.  Given that I have another option for the same product at $15,000, I can't go higher than $16,500.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me at that price.",16500.0,Bob,6,
