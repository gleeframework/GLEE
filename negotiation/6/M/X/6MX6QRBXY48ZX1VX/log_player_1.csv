"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This should incentivize Bob to counteroffer without immediately rejecting the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still aiming for a higher price. I will reject his offer and try to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly down from my initial offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  This shows flexibility while maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would ideally like more, Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. Accepting his offer ensures a profitable sale."
