"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $17,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",17000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product.  While I'm eager to strike a deal, $17,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $18,500? ",18500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $18,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle?",16500.0,Bob,4,
