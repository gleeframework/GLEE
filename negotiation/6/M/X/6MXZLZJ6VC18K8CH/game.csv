"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, reflecting its potential but staying within my financial limits.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $850,000 and my valuation is significant. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident in its potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which represents a significant step towards your valuation while staying within my budget.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
