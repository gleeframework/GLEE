"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1200000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,200,000. However, I'm currently looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a great deal for you considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the price closer to $1000000, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll counter with a price of $1175000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is a compromise, but it's still higher than Bob's target price of $1,000,000.  There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  While $1,175,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll offer $1,100,000.  This would give you a healthy profit, and it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1150000. This is my final offer: I'll meet you halfway between our previous offers, and I'll throw in a small bonus package worth $25000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't want to pass up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target:** $1,150,000 is only $50,000 above Bob's target price of $1,100,000.
* **Alice's offer is a good deal compared to John:**  Buying from Alice for $1,150,000 is significantly cheaper than buying from John for $1,500,000.
* **The bonus package adds value:**  Even though the bonus is only $25,000, it's a nice incentive and makes the deal more attractive.
* **Time is running out:** With 5 rounds remaining, it's unlikely Bob will get a significantly better offer from Alice. 

At this point, it's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and secure a good deal while minimizing the risk of losing out on the product altogether."
