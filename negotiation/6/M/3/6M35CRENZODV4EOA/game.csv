"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1200000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1200000. However, I'm currently looking to spend closer to $1000000.  I'm willing to pay $1050000, which is still a great deal for you considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the price closer to $1000000, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll counter with a price of $1175000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a great deal for both of us.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  While $1175000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll offer $1100000.  This would give you a healthy profit, and it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. ",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1150000. This is my final offer: I'll meet you halfway between our previous offers, and I'll throw in a small bonus package worth $25000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't want to pass up.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
