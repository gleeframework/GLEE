"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  This product is truly exceptional, and its value to you far exceeds that price. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a significant discount from my original asking price. It's a fair price that reflects the value you'll receive. Let's make this deal work!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is exceptional, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll receive. Can you consider my offer?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $10,000. However, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Given the exceptional value you'll get from this product, I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is a fair price that reflects the benefits you'll gain, and it's a great opportunity for us to finalize this deal.  What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,125. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll receive. Can you consider my offer?",10125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close to the end of our negotiation window. I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but $10,125 is still significantly lower than what I need to accept.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $10,200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a very fair price given the value you'll receive.  Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal.",10200.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,200, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and offer $10,150. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll receive. Can you consider my offer?",10150.0,Bob,8,
