"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob:** I'm emphasizing the value he'll get from the product to make the offer more enticing.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** By not starting at my minimum price, I leave space for Bob to counter without feeling pressured to accept my initial offer. 
* **Staying within the negotiation window:** This price allows for 10 rounds of negotiation, giving me flexibility to adjust if needed.

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds available."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still $6,000 below my floor.
* **There are still many rounds left:** I have 8 rounds to negotiate with Bob. There's still time to reach a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is a last resort:** I'd prefer to sell to Bob, but I'll only do so if I can't get a price closer to my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on value:** I will reiterate the value proposition of the product to Bob, highlighting the benefits he'll gain.
* **Remaining flexible:** I'll be prepared to adjust my price depending on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  This product is truly exceptional, and its value to you far exceeds that price. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a significant discount from my original asking price. It's a fair price that reflects the value you'll receive. Let's make this deal work!"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm moving closer to his offer, but not too much.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm still focusing on the product's worth to Bob, hoping to persuade him that the price is justified.
* **Setting the stage for future negotiations:** If Bob rejects again, I have room to drop my price further in subsequent rounds.

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's response:** I'll pay close attention to whether Bob accepts my counteroffer, makes a new counteroffer, or chooses to walk away.
* **Adjust my strategy accordingly:** If Bob rejects again, I'll need to decide whether to lower my price further or risk losing the deal.  I'll consider how many rounds remain and whether selling to John is becoming more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is exceptional, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll receive. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still $5,000 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Many rounds left:**  I have 6 rounds remaining, giving me ample opportunity to continue negotiating.
* **Selling to John is a last resort:** I'm committed to getting the best price for my product, but I want to explore all options with Bob first.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than Bob's current offer but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reiterate value:** I will emphasize the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the benefits he'll receive and how it's a worthwhile investment.
* **Stay flexible:** I will be prepared to adjust my price based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $10,000. However, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Given the exceptional value you'll get from this product, I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is a fair price that reflects the benefits you'll gain, and it's a great opportunity for us to finalize this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Still above my minimum:**  $10,250 is still $4,750 above my minimum. 
* **Emphasize the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and how it's a worthwhile investment.
* **Encourage closing the deal:**  I'm using language like ""finalize this deal"" to encourage Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's response:** I'll carefully watch Bob's reaction to my counteroffer. 
* **Adjust my strategy:** If Bob rejects, I'll consider lowering my price further or exploring the option of selling to John. I'll take into account the remaining rounds and the potential for a successful deal with Bob."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,125. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll receive. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still $3,875 below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation window shrinking:** We only have 4 rounds left, and selling to John is becoming increasingly attractive.
* **Finding common ground:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to ensure I'm getting a price that's closer to my value.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than Bob's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasize urgency:** I will remind Bob that we are approaching the end of the negotiation rounds and that selling to John is a viable option.
* **Strategic negotiation:** I will use the remaining rounds to assess Bob's willingness to compromise and adjust my counteroffer accordingly."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close to the end of our negotiation window. I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but $10,125 is still significantly lower than what I need to accept.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $10,200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a very fair price given the value you'll receive.  Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm framing this as my final offer to create urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Small concession:**  I'm making a small concession, but not too much, to show willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to persuade him to accept.
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the limited time remaining to emphasize that selling to John is a real possibility.

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's response:** I'll carefully observe if Bob accepts or rejects my offer.
* **Prepare for John:** If Bob rejects, I'll move forward with selling the product to John for $15,000.
* **Consider negotiation breakdown:** If Bob rejects, I'll assess if I'm willing to risk another round or if it's best to move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,200, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and offer $10,150. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll receive. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiations are stalled:**  We've reached a point where Bob and I are $50 apart, and with only two rounds remaining, it's unlikely we'll reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Time is running out:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation failures.
* **Potential for more negotiation:**  Although I have two more rounds, I'm not confident that Bob will come up to my minimum price.

**Decision:**  It's more advantageous to sell the product to John and secure a guaranteed $15,000. While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, the remaining time and potential for a deal breakdown are too risky."
