"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $13,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  However, $8,500 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  It's a fair price considering the value we've both discussed, and it's within my budget.  Let's try to close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
