"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is a fair price given the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, considering the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,500.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $11,500 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $11,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's close the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $11,500, which is $11,250. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this price.",11250.0,Alice,5,
