Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm getting close to your target, but I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm now offering you the product for $795,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Price is Right:** You're getting the product for significantly less than your $1,200,000 maximum and Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $795,000.
* **""Final Offer"":** Alice has signaled that this is likely her best price. Pushing further might make her less willing to negotiate.
* **Time:**  You still have time, but dragging it out might not yield much better results. 

It's a solid deal - congratulations on the successful negotiation!"
