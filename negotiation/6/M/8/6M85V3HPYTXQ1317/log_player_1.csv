Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer sets a price significantly higher than John's offer, aiming to maximize profit. However, it acknowledges the risk of Bob rejecting it.  

Here's the reasoning:

* **Maximize Potential Earnings:**  $1,500,000 is a substantial increase over the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** This price signals that you value the product highly and are confident in its worth. It might encourage Bob to consider the potential value to him and potentially make a counter-offer.
* **Calculated Risk:** The risk of rejection is accepted. If Bob does reject, you still have John's guaranteed offer.

This offer is a calculated gamble aiming for a high payoff, while providing a safety net."
