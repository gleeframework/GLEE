"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to get as close to my target as possible.  It's important to leave some room for negotiation, though.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I want to see if I can get closer to $20,000.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility but still aiming for a high sale price. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob room to come up a bit. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $17,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll counter again, but this time I might have to lower my price more significantly to keep the negotiation moving.  I'm still not ready to settle for John's offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm willing to come down to $18,000 this round. This is closer to Bob's last offer, but I'm still hoping to get as much as I can for the product. We're getting closer to a potential deal, so it's important to be flexible but also not give away too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum, but I'm still not ready to give up on getting a little closer to my original price. I'll try one more counteroffer before I consider selling to John.  I need to make sure I'm not leaving any money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500} 
```

This is my final attempt to get a bit closer to my target price before I consider selling to John.  If Bob rejects this, I'll likely settle for the $15,000 offer from John to avoid going through more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $500 below my minimum, and we're running out of time. I'm willing to accept his offer to secure the deal and avoid risking a lower offer from John or further rounds of negotiation that might not yield a better result."
