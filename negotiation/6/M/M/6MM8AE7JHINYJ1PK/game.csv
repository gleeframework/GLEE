"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $9800 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle of that and $10500?",9800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still a bit short on budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9800 and $10500, which would be $10150. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10150.0,Alice,5,
