"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 12000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it brings. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still above my budget.  I'm really hoping to secure this product for $9000. This is the very best I can do, and it's a fair price considering your last offer.  Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for 9000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm willing to sell it to you for 9800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it brings. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",9800.0,Alice,5,
