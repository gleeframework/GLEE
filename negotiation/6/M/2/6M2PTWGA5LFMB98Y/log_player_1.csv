Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start the negotiation with Bob at a higher price. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and the existence of other potential buyers to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $12,000, the wording leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high. You can then potentially negotiate down to a price that is still above your minimum ($10,000) but appealing to Bob.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to strike a balance. If you start too high, Bob might reject the offer outright without attempting to negotiate."
