"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but my budget is limited. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? I'd like to propose a price of $120. Looking forward to your response.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $200 and $120. How about we try $170? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at that price.",170.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but unfortunately, my budget is still not aligned with that price. I would like to suggest a counteroffer of $150. This would allow me to purchase the product while staying within my financial limits. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",150.0,Bob,4,
