Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter.  I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its value. To find a middle ground, I could let it go for $1,075,000.  This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate our back and forth, but I have to be honest,  $987,500 is cutting it too close. I'm open to making this work, but I need to see a price that reflects the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has stated that $1,050,000 is her final offer.  While she might be bluffing, it's getting too risky. We can get the product for a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. It's better to take the sure deal and save $50,000 than to risk getting a worse offer or reaching an impasse with Alice."
