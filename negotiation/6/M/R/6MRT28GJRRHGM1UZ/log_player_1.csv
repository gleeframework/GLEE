"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer. While $100 is a guaranteed sale, I want to try to get closer to my desired price of $115.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer.  I'm still hoping to get closer to $110, and we're only in round 4. There's still time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
``` 
 
I'm going to lower my counteroffer slightly to $108. Bob is clearly willing to pay more than $100, and I'm confident that with a little more negotiation, we can find a price we both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $102 is getting closer to my minimum of $100.  I'm concerned that if I continue to reject his offers, we might run out of time, and I'll be forced to sell to John for $100.  It's better to accept this offer and secure a profit."
