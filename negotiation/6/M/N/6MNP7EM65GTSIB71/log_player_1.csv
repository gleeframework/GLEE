{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) while ensuring a sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially still landing within a very profitable range for Alice.
* **Consider the Alternative:**  Knowing John guarantees $800,000 creates a strong fallback position. Alice shouldn't sell for anything less than this.

This offer balances ambition with a realistic understanding of the situation."
