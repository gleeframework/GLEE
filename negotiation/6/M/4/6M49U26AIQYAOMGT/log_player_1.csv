"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm starting the bidding at $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a high profit. 
* **Confidence:** The message projects confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware of John's offer, which serves as a strong fallback position. This allows me to negotiate confidently with Bob, knowing I have a guaranteed minimum offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is closer to my budget, but I'd like to start with $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is tempting, I believe there's still room for negotiation. We're early in the process, and I started high for a reason. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm aiming for a higher price, closer to his perceived value of $1,500,000. I'm willing to engage in further counteroffers to strive for a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit further from what I had in mind. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm making a significant concession by coming down $100,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:**  Proposing $1,300,000 positions the deal as a win-win, encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Time Consideration:**  With several rounds left, I can afford to negotiate strategically without feeling pressured to accept a lower offer immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and try $1,250,000.  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offers, which indicates he's motivated to buy. While $1,250,000 is a decent profit, I'm aiming for at least $1,300,000. I'm willing to push a bit further and see if he's open to a smaller concession in the next round. I'm not overly concerned about time yet, as six rounds remain, and I have John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from. Let's make this happen â€“ how about $1,275,000?  It's a strong offer that reflects the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I'm reducing my concession to $25,000, signaling that I'm nearing my desired price. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  While I'm not mentioning it directly, setting a firm price implies I'm getting closer to accepting John's offer if a deal can't be reached.
* **Final Push:** This offer encourages Bob to make a decision, aiming to either close the deal now or move closer to my desired price point in the next round."
