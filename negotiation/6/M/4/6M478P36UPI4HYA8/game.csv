"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $2000000 is a bit steep for you, but $800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1400000.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1400000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1000000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1200000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. $1200000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1100000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
