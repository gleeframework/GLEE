"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a price around $105. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me in the middle?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable. Let's make a deal!",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110, which would be $107.50. Can you consider that?",107.5,Bob,4,
