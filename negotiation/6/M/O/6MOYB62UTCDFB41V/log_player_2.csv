"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to you ($1,500,000).  There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can secure a better deal."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fair Counteroffer:**  The counteroffer of $1,400,000 is a significant step towards Alice's desired price ($1,500,000) but still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Clear Justification:** The message provides a clear justification for the counteroffer, focusing on the product's value to both parties.
* **Setting a Strong Foundation:** By starting with a higher counteroffer, it shows that Bob is serious about getting the product but is also willing to negotiate."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1400000.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1300000. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my own investment.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **One Round Left:** With only one round remaining, the risk of rejecting Alice's offer and potentially ending up buying from John at a higher price is significant.
* **Significant Savings:** While the price of $1,250,000 is still higher than you initially hoped for, it represents a considerable saving of $250,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Alice's Final Offer:** Alice has stated that this is her lowest price, indicating that further negotiation is unlikely.

Accepting Alice's offer is the most pragmatic choice, considering the time pressure and the potential for a higher price if the negotiation fails."
