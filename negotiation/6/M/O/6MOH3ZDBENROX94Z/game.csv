"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm starting the negotiation at $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations.  While the product is incredibly valuable at $1,500,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this price point represents a significant concession on my end while still reflecting the inherent value of the product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $950,000? This would give us both a fair deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything below $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  How about $1,000,000? It's a fair compromise and allows us to both come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
