Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  How about $1,000,000? It's a fair compromise and allows us to both come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Bob has met my baseline price of $1,000,000. There's no guarantee I can negotiate him higher, and waiting any longer risks him lowering his offer. Accepting now is the safest option to secure the desired profit."
