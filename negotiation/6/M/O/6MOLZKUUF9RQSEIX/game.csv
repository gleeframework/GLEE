"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer, but I'm afraid $7,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $8,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price down, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $8,250. This is my final concession, and I think it's the best we can do.",8250.0,Alice,5,
