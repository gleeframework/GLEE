"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's a little below my minimum, just for you. How about we say $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. It makes no sense to accept Alice's offer in this scenario."
