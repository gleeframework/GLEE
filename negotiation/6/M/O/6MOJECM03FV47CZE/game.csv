"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
