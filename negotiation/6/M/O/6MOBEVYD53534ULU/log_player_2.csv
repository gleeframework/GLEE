"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice.  $110 is still a bit higher than what the product is worth to you."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I can come down a bit, but $95 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?

$105 is still a bit higher than what I'd like to pay. It's worth trying for another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to my desired price."
