"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,300,000. This allows for a fair profit for both of us, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? I'm trying to make a smart financial decision, and I think this price would be more in line with my needs.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
