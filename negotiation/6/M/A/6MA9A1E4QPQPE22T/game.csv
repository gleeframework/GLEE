"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $850,000, but I'm afraid it's still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this incredible product. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is a compromise that I think will work for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
