"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if he's interested in the product at this price. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
 
I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer you $9,000, which is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. I want to see if he's willing to budge further, especially since we're halfway through the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to accept $9,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value and our ongoing negotiation.  Let's close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
 
I'm offering a middle ground again, showing flexibility while staying close to my target price. I'm also highlighting the fact that we're halfway through the negotiation, adding pressure to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  Let's aim for $9,250,  which is still a good price for you considering your original asking price and your willingness to negotiate. This price allows us to both benefit from the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,250 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have a few rounds left. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,250 is still a little low for me. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to go down to $9,375, which is a fair price considering my initial offer and your willingness to negotiate.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal now."", ""product_price"": 9375}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer that's a small compromise, showing flexibility while still maintaining my goal of maximizing my profit. I'm also emphasizing the benefits of closing the deal now, hoping to encourage Bob to accept."
