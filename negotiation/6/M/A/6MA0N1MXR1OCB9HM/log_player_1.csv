Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate and appear flexible if Bob counters.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By starting at $120, we can see how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We always have John as a backup, guaranteeing us at least $80. This knowledge gives us confidence in our negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Counter:** While $90 is less than our initial ask, it's still a $10 profit over selling to John. However, there's room for negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting Bob's offer, we signal that we believe the product is worth more than his valuation. This allows us to see if he's willing to go higher.
* **Backup Plan:** We still have the security of John's offer, so we're not desperate to accept $90 immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?"", 
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, which keeps the negotiation moving.
* **Targeting Profit:**  $105 is still a significant markup from our minimum and a good profit margin.
* **Leaving Room:**  While we're closer to his offer, there's still space for Bob to counter if he's really interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** $95 is a $15 profit over John's offer, making it a good deal.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might alienate Bob or lead to a stalemate. It's unlikely we'll get much higher than $95.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and ensures we secure the profit."
