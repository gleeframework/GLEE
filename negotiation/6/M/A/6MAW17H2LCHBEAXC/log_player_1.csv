Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000,  trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * Bob gets the product for $50,000 less than its worth to him.
    * Alice earns $150,000 more than selling it to John immediately.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value of the offer."
