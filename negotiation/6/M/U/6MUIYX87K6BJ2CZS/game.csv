"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special.

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for something more in line with my initial offer. How about $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your initial offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm willing to move up a bit, how about $800,000? This is my final offer, as it matches what I can get elsewhere.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and my original price, which would be $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
