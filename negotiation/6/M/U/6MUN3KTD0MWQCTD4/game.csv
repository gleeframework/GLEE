"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is too high. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't justify paying that much. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $10,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to acquire the product at a reasonable price. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  While $10,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still above my budget. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and go with $14,000?  This price reflects the product's value and allows me to acquire it within my budget. I'm confident we can find common ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,
