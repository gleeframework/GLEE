Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $10,750 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference again? I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is my final offer, so let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me, and I've already made multiple concessions. While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not going to lose out on a good deal. I'll sell the product to John for $12,000."
