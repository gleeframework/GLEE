Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $100. I believe it will be highly valuable for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price (even if vague) can make it seem more reasonable.  
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer will help you understand how interested Bob is and if he's willing to pay above the minimum value. 

If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can then propose a lower price, gradually moving closer to $80 but still aiming for a price higher than your minimum."
