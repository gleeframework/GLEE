"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe the product is valuable, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you have a budget, Bob, and I appreciate your offer. However,  $10,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  Would you consider $13,000? It's a fair compromise that reflects the true value.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $11,500. Can you consider that?",11500.0,Bob,4,
