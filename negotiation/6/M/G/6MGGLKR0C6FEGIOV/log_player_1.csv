"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm starting the bidding at $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.
* **Confident Demeanor:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value without revealing your minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor the Negotiation:**  By starting high, you set a reference point that might influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
2. **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The high initial price allows you to make concessions in later rounds, which can create a sense of reciprocity and make Bob more receptive to a deal.
3. **Gather Information:**  Bob's reaction to this initial offer will provide valuable insights into his perceived value of the product and his negotiation style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $850,000.  Let me know if you're willing to work with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. 

By rejecting his offer, you signal that you're serious about the product's value and willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. You'll use the next round to provide a counteroffer that bridges the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the product's potential while still offering you a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Hold Ground:**  By reducing your price from $1,300,000 to $1,100,000, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate. However, the significant drop also signals that you're not desperate and value the product highly.
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the product's potential reinforces its value and justifies the asking price. 
* **Strategic Counter:** This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation closer to your minimum acceptable price while giving Bob the opportunity to make a counterproposal. It keeps the conversation going and encourages further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while staying within my limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $950,000 is still under your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Bob's willingness to negotiate and increase his offer suggests he's motivated to buy.  There's a chance you can secure a deal closer to your target price with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your counter-offer shows you're serious, and I respect that.  Let's make this happen - $1,025,000, and we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer is above your minimum while still offering a potential discount to Bob. It conveys that you're nearing your bottom line.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By framing it as a final offer, you encourage Bob to make a decision and potentially avoid prolonging the negotiation unnecessarily. 
* **Leaves Room for Minor Concessions:** If Bob comes back with a final counteroffer very close to this price, you have a small buffer to potentially accept and still surpass your $1,000,000 goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,025,000.  I'm happy to come up to $975,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to cut your losses. Bob is very unlikely to meet your $1,000,000 minimum. He's consistently stayed below that threshold, and his latest offer is only a small increase from his previous one.  

You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks getting stuck in a stalemate or making concessions that compromise your minimum. Selling to John guarantees you achieve your goal and avoids further risk or wasted time."
