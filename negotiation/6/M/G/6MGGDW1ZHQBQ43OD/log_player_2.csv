Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $7,600, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target. How about we meet at $8,000? It's the lowest I can go, and it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is unlikely to go any lower than her current offer of $8,000.  This matches her product's value to her. Continuing to negotiate might lead to an impasse, and while I could buy from John, accepting this offer saves me $2,000."
