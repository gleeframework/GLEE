Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to offer $12000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me is $10000.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $13,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me is $10000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $12,500.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit for me and it's likely that Bob won't budge any further.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for less."
