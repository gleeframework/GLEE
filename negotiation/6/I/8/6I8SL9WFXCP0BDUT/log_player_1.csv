Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's significantly higher than my minimum ($800,000), but leaves room for negotiation and still leaves Bob with a decent profit. 

I'm keeping in mind that:

* **I have an alternative buyer:**  John is willing to pay $800,000, giving me a fallback option if the negotiation with Bob fails.
* **Bob's perceived value:**  I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, so I can aim high, but I need to be realistic and leave space for a compromise. 
* **Negotiation is a process:** I'm prepared to counteroffer and make adjustments based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and doesn't reflect the value of the product to him. 

I will counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'll use this opportunity to negotiate and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, how about $850,000?  That still leaves you a good profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm taking a more moderate approach with this counteroffer. 

* **Reasoning:** My initial offer was $950,000, and Bob's counteroffer was $700,000.  $850,000 is a compromise that's closer to my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and leaves room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Positioning:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and highlighting the potential profit he can still make. This approach is more likely to encourage him to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850000, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we meet in the middle at $825000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  accepting his offer is a good outcome, especially considering my alternative option of selling to John for $800,000. 

I'm willing to accept this offer as a compromise and secure a sale at a reasonable price."
