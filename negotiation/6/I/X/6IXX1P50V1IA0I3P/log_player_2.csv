Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,800. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $8,100. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her final offer. While we could push for a slightly lower price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $8,100.  This price represents a significant savings compared to John's $12,000 offer. Accepting now secures a good deal."
