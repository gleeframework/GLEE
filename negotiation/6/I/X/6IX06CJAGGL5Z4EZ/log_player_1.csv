Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum acceptable value and might entice Bob to make a counteroffer. I'll be prepared to negotiate if necessary, but I'm hoping to get a good price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
While I'm willing to sell to John for $150, I'd prefer to keep negotiating with Bob. $150 is my minimum, and I'm hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $175. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves room for further bargaining if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. $160 is closer to my desired price than John's offer, and further negotiation might not lead to a significantly higher price. It's better to secure a sale at this point."
