"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it allows room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but also demonstrating that I still value the product.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to make a final counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $12,000 is a decent price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. I'm hoping that by continuing to negotiate, I can convince Bob to raise his offer. There are still several rounds left, and I don't want to settle for less if I can get more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $13,000.  I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, showing him I'm serious about selling but also trying to get closer to my desired price. It's a little lower than my last offer, but still a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I'm hoping this encourages Bob to accept and avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm concerned that we're not making progress. I'm worried that if I keep rejecting his offers, he might walk away completely. At this point, I'd rather accept the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk getting nothing from Bob."
