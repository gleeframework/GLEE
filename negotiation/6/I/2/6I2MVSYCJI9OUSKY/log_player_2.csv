"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is closer to her value than mine. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?"", 
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This leaves room for me to increase my offer while still aiming for a price well below her initial offer and closer to my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, how about $10,000?  This price reflects the value of the product, and it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to my maximum budget of $10,000. There is no point in negotiating further or buying from John since I'd be paying the same price. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at the best possible price for me."
