{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but still leaves me with a profit. It's also a price that could potentially be appealing to Bob, as it's lower than his perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging. I'm highlighting the potential value of the product for Bob and inviting him to respond.

**Strategy:**

This opening offer allows me to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If he accepts, I get a good price.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** If he rejects, I can use his counteroffer to determine how willing he is to pay. 
* **Keep John in the picture:**  I'm always prepared to walk away and sell to John, so Bob knows my offer isn't a desperate one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target.  I believe I can push for a higher price through further negotiation.  There's a good chance Bob is willing to pay more, especially considering he's already rejected my initial offer.  I'm also confident that I can get a better price than John's offer, which is my safety net.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $900,000. I'll use a similar approach to my first offer, focusing on emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting the potential benefits for Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $875,000.  This product is truly unique, and I believe its value to you justifies a price in this range.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a higher price.  $875,000 is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate.
* **Message:** I'm staying polite and focusing on the value proposition for Bob. I'm also implying that there is room for further negotiation, which keeps the conversation open. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer allows me to:

* **Test the waters:** I want to see how firmly Bob is committed to his offer.
* **Stay in control:**  I'm not giving away too much ground too quickly.
* **Maintain leverage:** By keeping John as an option, I'm ensuring that Bob understands the stakes and that I'm not afraid to walk away.

I'm confident that I can eventually secure a price closer to my target, especially if Bob is serious about purchasing the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $825,000 is significantly lower than my target price. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of getting stuck in a protracted and potentially fruitless back-and-forth is too high. 

John's offer of $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and ensures a quick and hassle-free transaction. 

**Strategy:**

Given Bob's reluctance to meet my expectations, it's in my best interest to secure a guaranteed sale.  While I'd prefer to earn more, accepting John's offer is a prudent decision. It minimizes risk and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
