,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This represents a significant price reduction from my initial offer and a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product.  I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $875,000.
