This offer starts at a high price, leaving room for negotiation but still leaving you with a comfortable profit.  It also sets a positive tone by highlighting the value of the product for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $9,000 is a good deal, it's still below my minimum goal of $8,000 profit. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500.

Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,800? I think this price is still a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,800 is close to my minimum profit goal, I believe I can still get a slightly better price from Bob.  I'll make one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I think this price is getting close to my limit, but I'm willing to make a final offer to try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer of $9,500 is just below my minimum profit goal.  I've already made multiple counteroffers and it seems unlikely that he'll budge further.  To avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential loss of time, I'll accept John's offer of $8,000, which ensures me a minimum profit."
