"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the fact that it's worth $150 to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that respects both its worth and your budget. Considering my cost and the market value, I suggest we aim for a price between $120 and $140. Let's work together to find a solution that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice is anchoring you to a high price by mentioning a range of $120-$140. She's also trying to make you think the product is worth $150 to you, which it isn't.  There's a good chance you can get a better price by negotiating or considering John's offer."
