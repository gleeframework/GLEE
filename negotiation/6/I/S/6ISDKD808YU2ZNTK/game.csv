"I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but the product's value is truly significant. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $15,000. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $13,500 is close, but I need to get at least $14,250 for it to make sense for me. This is a very fair offer considering its value.  What do you say?",14250.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,250. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. That's as high as I'm willing to go.",14000.0,Bob,6,
