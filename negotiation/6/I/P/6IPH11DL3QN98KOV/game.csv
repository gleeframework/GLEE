"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to get a good return on my investment. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still gives you a significant advantage, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,250,000?  This would still give you a profit, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
