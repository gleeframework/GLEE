"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $13,000. I think it's a fair price considering what you'll gain. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I see where you're coming from, but $9,500 is a significant drop from my initial price. How about we settle on $11,500? That reflects the product's true worth while still giving you a competitive price.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $9,750? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price.",9750.0,Bob,4,
