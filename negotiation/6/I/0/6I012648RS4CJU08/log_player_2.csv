# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. It's best to go directly to John for the best price."
