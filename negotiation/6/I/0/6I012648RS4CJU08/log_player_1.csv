Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the product is worth ""a significant amount,"" Alice attempts to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value higher than $100. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Subtly reminding Bob that she has other buying options (John) might encourage him to accept a higher price. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider reasonable. If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can always negotiate down, knowing she has John as a backup buyer."
