"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is a significant investment for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than that based on its unique features and market potential.  I could consider letting it go for $1,300,000. This is a fair offer, reflecting the product's true worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
