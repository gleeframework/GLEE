"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can agree on this.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm comfortable with $11,000, which leaves room for both of us to get a good deal.  Let's find some common ground.",11000.0,Bob,4,
