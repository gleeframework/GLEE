"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still too high.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts his counteroffer by acknowledging Alice's offer and expressing his interest in the product. However, he clearly states his intention to pay a lower price. He offers a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within Bob's budget. This establishes a clear starting point for negotiation, and leaves room for further adjustments in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask. This product has immense value, and I'm confident in its potential to deliver substantial returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the initial price, it's still above Bob's target.  There is still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue to try to get a lower price.  He should aim for a counteroffer that is closer to his target price of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you believe in the product's value, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving money but is also showing flexibility by increasing his offer slightly. This demonstrates his willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price point closer to his target. The message is also friendly and emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable price, encouraging a continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't let this go for less than $1,280,000.  I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his goal of saving money, and Alice is also becoming more flexible in her pricing.  While $1,280,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, it is a reasonable compromise given the limited rounds remaining.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price and avoid the potential risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
