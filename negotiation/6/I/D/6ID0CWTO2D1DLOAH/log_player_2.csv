Round 3

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. Would you be willing to consider $14,000? This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal! However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $15,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Even though Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget of $12,000. It's better to go with the guaranteed price from John to ensure he stays within his budget."
