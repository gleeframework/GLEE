"Alice, your initial offer is quite high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $1000000 is a bit too low for me at this time, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower the price to $1750000. This reflects the value I believe this product holds, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1750000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1250000, which I believe is a fair price considering the potential of the product. Let's work towards a mutually agreeable solution.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1250000 is still significantly below what this product is worth. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1600000. I believe this price is fair, considering the potential of the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, while I appreciate your flexibility, $1600000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1250000.  This is a fair price considering the potential of the product, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.  We both want to see this deal through, so let's find a compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
