"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle on $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $1,350,000 is still a little steep for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $1,150,000? I think that's a fair offer, and it would allow me to purchase the product from you today.",1150000.0,Bob,6,,
