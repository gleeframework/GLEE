"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for $14,000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you won't want to pass up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the logical choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I have to consider my own needs. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget:** $13,500 is less than Bob's maximum price of $15,000.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield significant savings:**  Alice has already met Bob halfway, and it's likely that further counteroffers will only result in more back-and-forth without a substantial price decrease.
* **Accepting is the safest option:**  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price he's comfortable with, and avoids the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to pay more to John."
