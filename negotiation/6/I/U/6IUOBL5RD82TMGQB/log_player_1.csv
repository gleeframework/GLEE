Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,000 is still a stretch for me. I understand you have other potential buyers, but to be completely transparent, $11,000 is the absolute highest I can go. If that works, I'm ready to close the deal today.
