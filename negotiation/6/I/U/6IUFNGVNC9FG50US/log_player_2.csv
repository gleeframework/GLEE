Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is now the best available option.  It's lower than John's price, and there's a good chance that continued negotiation might not yield a significantly better price.  Bob should accept to secure a deal that's within his budget."
