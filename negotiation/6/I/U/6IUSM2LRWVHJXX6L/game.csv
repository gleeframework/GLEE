"Alice, I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product, but your initial offer is unfortunately out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which reflects its value to me.  I believe this is a fair price considering its potential, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While your offer is tempting, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,100,000. This price reflects the product's potential while staying within my financial constraints. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
