"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $13,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $13,500 is closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is my final offer, let me know if it works for you.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. My final counteroffer is $13,000 for the product. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,5,
