"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $20,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

This counter-offer is a starting point in the negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaves room for negotiation.  Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Anchoring:** By starting low, I aim to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range. Even if Alice rejects this initial offer, it sets a lower reference point.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer helps gauge Alice's flexibility. Her reaction will provide valuable information about her willingness to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option:** I always have the option to go to John and buy for $10,000. This knowledge gives me leverage in the negotiation with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its value. Could you do $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand it's valuable to you, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, say around $12,000?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:**  Alice came down from $20,000 to $18,000,  I'm proposing we roughly split the difference between her last offer and my last offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still moving closer to my target price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I haven't agreed to pay more than my $10,000 fallback option with John. This keeps me in a strong negotiating position. 
* **Testing for Flexibility:**  Alice's response will tell me how flexible she's willing to be. If she's firm on a price close to $18,000, I might need to consider John's offer."
