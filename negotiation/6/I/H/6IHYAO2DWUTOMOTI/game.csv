"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great addition to your portfolio. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiations.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1100000 is closer, it's still beyond my budget.  I'm ready to close the deal right now for $1050000. This represents a significant savings for you and allows us to both come to a fair agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1075000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1075000 is very close to what I can afford.  However,  I'm going to need to see that price come down just a bit more.  I'm willing to close the deal right now for $1025000. This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing us to finalize the transaction quickly. What do you say?",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1025000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
