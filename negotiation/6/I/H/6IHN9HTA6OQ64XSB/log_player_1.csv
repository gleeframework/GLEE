Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but she needs to offer Bob a price that's enticing.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so Alice needs to offer it for less than $1,200,000 (John's offer) to make it appealing to him.
* **Negotiation Room:** The offer of $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation, while still securing a significant profit for Alice if Bob accepts. 

**This strategy aims to:**

1. **Secure a sale to Bob:**  The price is attractive compared to John's offer.
2. **Maximize Alice's profit:**  If Bob accepts, Alice makes a $300,000 profit. 
3. **Leave a backup option:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can still sell to John for her minimum acceptable price."
