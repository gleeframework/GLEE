Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we split the difference at $950,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $800,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? It's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **You're close to your limit:** $875,000 is just slightly above your ideal price, but still well within your $800,000 limit. 
* **Alice is negotiating:** She's clearly willing to come down on price, demonstrating a willingness to make a deal.
* **Time is a factor:** You have fewer rounds left, and there's no guarantee Alice will go as low as $800,000.  

While you could try to push for a slightly lower price, you risk Alice becoming frustrated or sticking closer to her previous offer.  Accepting now secures you the product at a reasonable price."
