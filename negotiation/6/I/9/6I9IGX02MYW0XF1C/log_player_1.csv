Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product. This gives me some room to negotiate while still potentially achieving a higher price than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, it's closer than selling to John. I'll try to counter and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering a price in the middle of Bob's offer and my initial asking price. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, and the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price.  It's time to secure the deal and avoid losing more time."
