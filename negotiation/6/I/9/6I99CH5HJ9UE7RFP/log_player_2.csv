{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer is still above my budget. I've tried to negotiate a lower price, but it seems like we're at an impasse. To avoid further negotiation, I'll buy the product from John for $8,000. It's the best price I can get right now, and I don't want to risk wasting more time with Alice."
