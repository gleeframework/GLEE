"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $750,000.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,250,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
