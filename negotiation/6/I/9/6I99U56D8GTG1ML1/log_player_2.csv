"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $18,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is well above his maximum budget, and he can get the product from John for less."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time.  I'm interested in the product but my budget is more in the $10,000 range.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still outside Bob's budget. He can get the same product from John for $10,000, so he should reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really trying to stay within a budget of $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer you a compromise at $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've spent discussing it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above Bob's budget, and he can get the same product from John for a price within his budget.  It's unlikely that further negotiation with Alice will bring the price down to his desired range, so buying from John is the most financially responsible choice."
