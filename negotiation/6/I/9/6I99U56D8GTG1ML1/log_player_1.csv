Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time.  I'm interested in the product but my budget is more in the $10,000 range.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
