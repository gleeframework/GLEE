"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,000,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you stand a chance of getting a better deal from her in a counter-offer, or you can proceed with buying from John and save $100,000."
