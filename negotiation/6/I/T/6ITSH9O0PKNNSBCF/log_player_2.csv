# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $120 for it. This offer takes into account both the cost of production and the significant value this product holds for you, based on my understanding. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

Alice's offer is too high. You can try to get a better price by rejecting it, hoping she'll come back with a lower offer. If she doesn't, you can always fall back on buying from John for $150."
