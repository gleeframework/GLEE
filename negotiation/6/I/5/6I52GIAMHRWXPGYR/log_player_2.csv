"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire the product at a price significantly below its value to you while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows for the potential to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. This is still a significant profit for you and a good deal for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a very good deal for you given the product's value. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's significantly less than buying from John for $1,500,000, and it allows Bob to acquire the product while saving $100,000.  While there might be a chance for a slightly lower price in future rounds, the risk of Alice rejecting future counteroffers and Bob having to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential gains."
