{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'm looking to get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can get a better offer. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would be a great price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not comfortable with $950,000, and I still think $700,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $950,000, so I'll offer $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $825,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable with it. I believe I can get a better offer, especially since I can always sell to John for $1,200,000. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 still doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'm looking to get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob is getting closer to my desired price,  $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. At this point, I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for a much higher price. Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
