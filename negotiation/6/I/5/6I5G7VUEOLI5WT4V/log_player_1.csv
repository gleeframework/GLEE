Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500. This still leaves room for profit for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's finalize this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a bit more, $13,000 is a good price and ensures I make a decent profit. It's also important to remember that I'm only 4 rounds in and there are still 6 rounds left if the negotiations continue.  It's better to secure the deal now than risk losing it entirely."
