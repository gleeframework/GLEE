"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'll be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject the offer. You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering it for $100. You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $90. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I can come down a bit to $95, but that's my final offer. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
You should accept Alice's offer. Alice has come down to $95, which is within your budget, and you have a good chance of getting a better price than John's. It's likely that you will not be able to get a lower price in the remaining rounds, so it's worth accepting this offer."
