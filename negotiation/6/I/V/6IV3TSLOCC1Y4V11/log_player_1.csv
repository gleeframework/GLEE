Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000.  I know it's valuable to you and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $10,000, Alice knows its worth at least $15,000 and has a guaranteed buyer at that price.  Therefore, she starts with a higher offer to see if there's room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $19,000 offer provides a buffer for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Alice's minimum.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and frames the price as ""fair"" to encourage a positive response. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:**  If Alice has any insight into Bob's negotiating tendencies (e.g., whether he's likely to make a counter-offer), she can adjust her strategy accordingly. 
* **Relationship Building:**  Even though Alice has a guaranteed buyer, maintaining a positive relationship with Bob might be valuable for future business opportunities. Her communication style should reflect that."
