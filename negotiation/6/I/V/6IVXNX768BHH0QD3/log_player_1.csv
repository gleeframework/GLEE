Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  I believe it will be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible while still securing a significant profit beyond John's guaranteed offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some wiggle room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It's unlikely he'll accept the first offer without some back and forth.
* **Strong Value Proposition:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and the ""exclusive opportunity"" to create a sense of urgency.

By setting the initial price at $1,150,000, Alice aims to:

1.  Secure a substantial profit over John's offer.
2.  Potentially close the deal with Bob if he's willing to pay a premium for exclusivity.
3.  Open the door for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price."
