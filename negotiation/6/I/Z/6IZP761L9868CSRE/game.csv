"Alice,  $9,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,200.",9200.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,800. I'm willing to give you a slightly better offer, but I think $9,100 is my minimum. It's a great price for this product, and I think you'll be happy with it.",9100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,100 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,900.  This would be a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'd still be making a profit.",8900.0,Bob,6,
