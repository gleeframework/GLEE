Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 925000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so aiming high is key to maximizing profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A slightly lower price than Bob's maximum allows for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant gain for Alice.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value of the product.

This strategy balances risk and reward. If Bob accepts, Alice gets a great deal. If he rejects it, she still has a guaranteed sale with John."
