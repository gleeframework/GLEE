"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10000.  Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer and is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum budget of $8,000. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  He has 7 rounds left before he needs to make a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for you as well."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. I appreciate your offer, but $9000 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to come down to $9500.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. Although Alice has lowered her price to $9,500, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Bob should continue negotiating, as he has 5 rounds remaining before he needs to decide on a purchase."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer!  $9,500 is still a little out of my range. I'm willing to offer $9,250. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and we could finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
