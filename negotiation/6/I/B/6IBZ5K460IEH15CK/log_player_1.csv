"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price, leaving room for potential concessions.  
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value and potential benefits for Bob's business, we aim to anchor his perception of the product's worth at a higher level.
* **Leaving Room:** This initial offer allows for negotiation downwards while still aiming for a price significantly above both Bob's perceived value and John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below our minimum acceptable price and even further below our target. While his counteroffer was expected, we have ample room for negotiation and rounds left to explore a better deal. Selling to John is our safety net, but we can likely get closer to our desired price with a few more rounds with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the unique benefits this product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider $1,000,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By coming down to $1,000,000, we demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while still staying well above Bob's initial offer.
* **Justification:**  We're not just meeting halfway; we're framing it as a considerable concession to encourage Bob to make a more substantial move.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** This counteroffer keeps us in a solid bargaining position. We're still aiming for a price that significantly exceeds Bob's perceived value and keeps us comfortably above John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can come to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer, but his offer is still significantly below our target. We're only in Round 4, so we have time to continue negotiating. We'll try to guide him closer to the $1 million mark before considering a compromise. We'll also assess his language in the next round to gauge his willingness to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your commitment and understand your budgetary constraints.  Let's aim for a win-win.  How about we settle at $980,000? This demonstrates my willingness to find a solution while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 980000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a smaller concession this round ($20,000 vs. $50,000) to signal we're nearing our bottom line. 
* **Anchoring:**  By suggesting a specific price, we aim to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired range, rather than continually meeting in the middle.
* **Emphasize Fairness:** We reiterate the ""win-win"" and ""fair deal"" concepts to remind Bob this negotiation should benefit both parties, not just him getting the lowest price. 
* **Prepare for Decision:**  While we're open to going one more round, this offer puts us in a strong position to either close the deal or seriously consider selling to John if Bob doesn't meet us close to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you be willing to consider $970,000? I'm getting close to making a decision, and I want to make sure we can come to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a judgment call, but we're playing a bit of chicken now. Bob is clearly interested and trying to find his maximum price. He's also hinting at a decision point. By rejecting this offer, we're signaling that we're firm on our price and forcing him to either meet us closer to our number or walk away.

**Next Steps:**

We'll likely counter in the next round with a final offer, potentially $975,000, and make it clear that this is our absolute bottom line.  We'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't take this final offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate how engaged you've been throughout this process, and I want to make this work. My absolute best offer is $975,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and reflects my desire to find a solution. I need a decision on this final offer - is this something you can agree to?"",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're making it clear this is our bottom line by stating ""absolute best offer."" 
* **Small Concession:**  The $5,000 concession shows some flexibility but keeps us firmly above $970,000.
* **Call to Action:**  We're ending the back-and-forth with a direct question requiring a yes or no, pushing for a final decision.
* **Prepared to Walk:** If Bob doesn't accept $975,000, we will sell to John in the next round to maximize our profit and avoid potentially dragging this out further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. Would you be willing to consider $965,000? I'm getting close to making a decision, and I want to make sure we can come to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still unwilling to meet our near-final offer, even after we called it our ""absolute best."" This indicates he's unlikely to agree to a price that significantly benefits us. Holding out for a slightly higher offer from Bob carries more risk than reward at this point. 

By selling to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000, we maximize our profit and avoid the potential of a prolonged negotiation that might not yield a significantly better outcome."
