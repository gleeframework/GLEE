"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential earnings.  I'm also aware that Bob values the product at $800,000, so there is a potential for agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a better offer than the initial one, it's still below my minimum desired value of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, so I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, while still trying to secure a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum desired value of $1,200,000. I'm going to continue negotiating, hoping to get a better price before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway.  I'm lowering my previous counteroffer by $10,000, but I still want to make sure I get as close as possible to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and while Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still significantly below my desired value. It's clear that our bargaining positions are too far apart.  Rather than risk further negotiation that could lead to a less favorable outcome, I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000."
