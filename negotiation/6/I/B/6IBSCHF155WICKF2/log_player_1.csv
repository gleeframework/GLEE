Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** The product has a high floor value ($1,000,000 to both you and Bob). This allows for ambitious pricing.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Starting with a significantly higher offer ($1,500,000) allows you to gauge Bob's eagerness and potentially secure a much higher profit.
* **Fallback Option:**  The guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the initial high offer, you can negotiate downwards or proceed with John. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have some time to negotiate with Bob. If you need to sell the product quickly, a lower, more immediately appealing offer might be wiser."
