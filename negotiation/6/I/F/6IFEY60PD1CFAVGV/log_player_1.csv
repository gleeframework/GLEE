Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am offering $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground - I'm proposing $2,000,000. This price reflects a more accurate valuation while acknowledging your interest."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts in adjusting the price, Alice. While $2,000,000 is closer to my budget, I still believe we can reach an agreement. I am willing to offer $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is the best move at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  It's still a substantial profit over my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Momentum:** Bob's offer has increased significantly, indicating a strong desire for the product.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging negotiations with Bob carries the risk of him reducing his offer or walking away. Accepting now secures the deal. 

While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, accepting Bob's offer maximizes my potential profit."
