Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still lower than the product's value to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message can build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By not starting at the highest possible price, I leave space for Bob to counter and for us to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Plan B:** Knowing that John is willing to pay $80 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price of $120.
* **Time is on My Side:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $80, so I can afford to be patient and see if Bob is willing to come up on his offer. 
* **Negotiating Strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value to him strengthens my position.
* **Reasoning:** Providing a specific reason for the counteroffer (splitting the difference) makes it seem more logical and fair.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This counteroffer still leaves room for further negotiation if Bob isn't willing to go up to $105."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Upside:**  Bob is firm on his offer of $90, which is only slightly higher than what John is offering. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:** Continuing to negotiate risks a stalemate where Bob won't budge and I'll end up with a lower price than John's offer.
* **Time is Money:** It's not worth spending more time negotiating for a potentially small increase in price when I have a guaranteed $80 sale with John.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Selling to John ensures a quick and certain transaction, preventing potential delays or further negotiation that might not result in a significantly better outcome."
