"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's something you value at $150, and I'm willing to let it go for a very reasonable price. How about $120?  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is lower than what you'd pay John ($120 vs. $150).**  This means you'll save $30 by accepting Alice's offer. 
* **You value the product at $150, so paying $120 is still a good deal.** 

While you could try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, it's not guaranteed you'd be successful. Accepting her offer is the most logical choice to maximize your savings."
