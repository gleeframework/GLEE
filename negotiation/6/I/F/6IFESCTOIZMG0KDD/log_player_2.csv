# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product, which I believe would significantly benefit your endeavors. Given its high value and importance to you, I propose a special introductory offer. For a limited time only, you can acquire this exceptional product for $12,500.

Should you choose to proceed, I assure you of our commitment to providing unparalleled customer service and support throughout the transaction and beyond. Please let me know if you have any questions or require further information. I look forward to the possibility of serving you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is less than your $15,000 maximum, but it's still significantly more than the product's worth to her ($10,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you might prompt her to lower the price further to secure the sale."
