Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Can you consider my offer?

``` 

Bob's offers are still far below my minimum acceptable price. It's getting late in the negotiation, and it's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John. I will get a guaranteed $150, which is better than selling to Bob at such a low price."
