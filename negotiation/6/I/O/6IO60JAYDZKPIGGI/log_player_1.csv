Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $10,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that as possible while still making a profit. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $9,800.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but it's still a decent price. Since I value the product at $10,000, I'm not thrilled about accepting his offer, but I'm also not willing to give it away. Let's see... I think I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

I'll try to get closer to my desired price, so I'll offer Bob $9,600. This should be a reasonable compromise.

This time, I'll offer Bob $9,700. It's a bit of a risk, but I think it's worth it.

This time, I'll offer Bob $9,650. It's a small increase, but I'm hoping it will be enough to get him to budge.
