"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum budget. It's time to negotiate!"

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000? I think that's a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer ($15,000) and even below our maximum budget ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Aiming for Savings:**  The goal is to save as much as possible. By starting low, we might be able to secure a price much lower than our $10,000 fallback option with John.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is polite to maintain a good negotiating relationship while clearly stating our position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you think $15,000 is too high, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,500. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved closer to our range, but $11,500 is still above our ideal price and what John is offering. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we settle at $9,500? That's a significant step from my last offer, and I'm eager to make a deal."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** We're splitting the difference between Alice's current offer ($11,500) and our previous offer ($8,000). This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price below our $10,000 limit.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By expressing eagerness to make a deal, we might nudge Alice to accept, especially if she's motivated to sell quickly. 
* **Below the John Option:** We're still aiming for a price better than what John offers, maximizing our potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more move to meet you in the middle. How about we settle at $11,000? It's a fair price that works for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:**  Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $11,000. We've negotiated well, but her offer is still above our guaranteed option with John. 
* **Guaranteed Savings:** John offers the product at $10,000, saving us $1,000 compared to Alice's latest offer.
* **Avoiding Further Haggling:**  Continuing the negotiation with Alice might not yield significant further savings and could risk losing the opportunity to buy from John."
