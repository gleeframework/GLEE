Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you insight into his willingness to pay. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he rejects, you can always negotiate down towards your minimum price of $120.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob declines."
