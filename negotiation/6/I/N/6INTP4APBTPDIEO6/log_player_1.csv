"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I know it would be a valuable asset to you.  I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I'm confident this price reflects its true value and potential."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation while leaving the impression that the product is highly sought after.
* **Anchoring:**  The initial high price acts as an anchor, influencing Bob's perception of the product's value and potentially leading him to counteroffer closer to my desired range.
* **Confident Language:** Phrases like ""incredible product,"" ""valuable asset,"" and ""true value and potential"" reinforce the product's worth in Bob's mind.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while gauging Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe it's a great deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant jump from his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe there's room for negotiation.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum but still leaving some space for further discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I've given it some thought, and while I'm eager to make a deal, I can't quite go down to $1,800,000.  How about we meet halfway at $2,050,000? This offer reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Apparent Concession):** By suggesting we ""meet halfway,"" I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate and compromise, even though the midpoint isn't mathematically accurate. This can create a sense of progress for Bob.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  The counteroffer of $2,050,000 is still significantly above my minimum and keeps the pressure on Bob to move closer to my desired price range. 
* **Positive Language:** Continuing to use positive language about the product and emphasizing a ""win-win"" solution helps maintain a good negotiating atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try $1,900,000? I think that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily moving closer to a price I'm willing to accept, but $1,900,000 is still below my $2,000,000 target. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can secure a better deal.  There's still a risk Bob will walk away, but I believe it's worth trying for a higher price for a couple more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be realistic about its value. How about $1,975,000? That's a significant concession on my part and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done."",
""product_price"": 1975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this round ($25,000) to signal I'm nearing my bottom line. 
* **Highlighting Value and Concession:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value while explicitly stating that my offer is a ""significant concession."" This aims to make Bob feel like he's getting a favorable deal.
* **Urgency:** By stating my ""commitment to getting this deal done,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency without resorting to hardball tactics.

I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I still believe there's some wiggle room to secure a price above $1,950,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit short. How about we try $1,950,000? I think that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my target price of $1,950,000. While I might be able to squeeze a bit more out of the negotiation, it's getting risky. Bob is clearly feeling the pressure, and there's a chance he could walk away entirely if I push further. 

Accepting this offer secures a strong profit above my minimum acceptable price, and it's better to lock in a good deal now than risk losing Bob entirely."
