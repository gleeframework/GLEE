"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be willing to pay something closer to $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $120. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price, but $120 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we try to find a middle ground? Would you be willing to consider $90 for the product?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering it to you for $110. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",110.0,Alice,5,
