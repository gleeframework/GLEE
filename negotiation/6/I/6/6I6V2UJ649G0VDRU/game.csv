"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. ",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that work for you?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.",10000.0,Alice,5,
