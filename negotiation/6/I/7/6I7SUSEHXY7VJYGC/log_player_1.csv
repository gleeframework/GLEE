"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $17,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable.  This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and optimistic.  It emphasizes the product's value without being overly aggressive. 

**Strategy:** 

I'm aiming for a quick negotiation, but I'm also ready to play it out for a few rounds if needed.  I'll use the information from Bob's response (accept, reject, or counteroffer) to adjust my approach for future rounds.  Remember, I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 at any time, which gives me a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $12,000 is significantly less than my minimum desired price of $15,000. I cannot accept this offer.
* **Negotiation is Necessary:**  While I could sell to John for $15,000, there's still potential to earn more with Bob.  I'm going to try to meet in the middle with a counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price closer to my desired $15,000, but I'll also be ready to compromise slightly in the next round if needed. My goal is to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is a bit below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to compromise. How about $14,000? This would still allow me to make a fair profit, and it's closer to your budget."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $17,000 to $14,000, but I'm still above my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Framing:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a way for both of us to find a solution that works.  
* **Maintaining Profit:** The $14,000 price is a reasonable compromise that allows me to meet my minimum price. 

**Strategy:** 

This round is crucial. If Bob accepts, we're done. If he rejects, I'll need to assess if he's genuinely interested in negotiating or just trying to get a low price.  I'll be ready to either adjust my price again or move on to John if I think there's no chance of a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far off from my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11,500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** $11,500 is well below my minimum price of $15,000.  I cannot afford to accept such a low offer.
* **Negotiation Still Possible:** While I'm getting closer to John's offer, I still believe there's potential to get a better deal with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

This is a critical round.  Bob's ""final offer"" likely means he's not willing to go much higher.  However, I'm going to attempt one more counteroffer to see if I can get him closer to my minimum.  If he rejects that, I'll go with John's offer to ensure a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  I'm willing to go down to $13,000. That's a significant compromise on my part, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's try to close this deal.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm emphasizing this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and potentially encourage Bob to accept.
* **Compromise:** While $13,000 is still above my minimum, it's a significant compromise from my previous offer.  This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. 
* **Fair Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, subtly suggesting that this price is still a good deal for him. 

**Strategy:**

At this point, I'm hoping to get Bob to accept the offer. If he rejects, I'm going to sell to John.  I'm willing to take a slight loss to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:**  Bob's final offer of $11,000 is far below my minimum desired price of $15,000.  I cannot afford to accept such a low offer. 
* **Time is Running Out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm concerned that further bargaining will only result in more dead ends. 

**Strategy:** 

I've reached a point where continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to yield a better result than selling to John.  I'm choosing to secure a sale at a price that meets my minimum requirement, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant portion of my product's worth."
