Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I want to try and get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I hoped, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,150,000. Would that be agreeable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still aiming for a higher price than $1,150,000. I'll counteroffer again to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. How about $1,200,000? That's a good compromise that gives you a great price and me a fair return.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,175,000. This seems like a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired outcomes. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get a bit closer to my desired price, $1,175,000 is a good deal and a significant profit. With only 4 rounds remaining, it's likely that continuing to negotiate will only lead to lower offers or a sale to John. Accepting this offer will ensure a substantial profit and a closed deal."
