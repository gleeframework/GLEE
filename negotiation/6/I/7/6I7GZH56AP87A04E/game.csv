"Alice, while I acknowledge the value of this product, your initial offer is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $1,100,000 for it. This reflects its value to me and leaves some room for negotiation. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is significantly below my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point still reflects the true value and potential of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers both our needs and the value of the product.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
