"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's best to start the negotiation by rejecting Alice's initial offer. This allows you to set the tone and demonstrate your intention to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you be willing to come down to $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  $110 is still above your target of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $108? That's a fair compromise, and it's closer to where I'm comfortable with the price."", ""product_price"": 108}
