"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $140, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum but still below what I know the product is worth to Bob. This should open the negotiation in a way that leaves room for compromise while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $135?  This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth it."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. Would you be willing to consider $132? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$132 is still above my minimum of $120 and it's getting close to my initial offer of $140.  I'm confident we're on the verge of closing the deal and don't want to risk losing the sale by being too stubborn."
