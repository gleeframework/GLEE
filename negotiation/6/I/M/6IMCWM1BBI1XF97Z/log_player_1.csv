"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** By starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum, I aim to anchor the negotiation in my favor. This gives me room to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a price well above Bob's $800,000 valuation. 
* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence in the product's value helps justify the high initial price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** While the starting price is high, the wording leaves room for negotiation, signaling to Bob that I'm willing to discuss terms.

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility while keeping the potential for a highly profitable deal alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my target price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not to that extent this early in the process.  I'm confident I can get a better deal by countering and continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  It seems we both see the significant value in this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This reflects its true worth while recognizing your desire for a fair deal."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** I've made a substantial concession from my initial price, signaling flexibility.  However, the new offer is still considerably above Bob's initial offer, keeping me firmly in a profitable position.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm continuing to emphasize the product's intrinsic value to justify the high price.
* **Seeking Compromise:** The message frames the counteroffer as an attempt to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 

My goal is to bring Bob closer to my target price without alienating him entirely.  By making a significant move, I'm hoping to encourage him to reciprocate with a more substantial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and represents a significant profit. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher amount in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that the final offer won't be substantially better. 

Here's why accepting now is a strong move:

* **Strong Profit:** $1,075,000 is a $75,000 gain over my guaranteed sale to John and a substantial profit overall.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing negotiations always carries the risk of Bob reducing his offer or reaching an impasse. 
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations, allowing me to allocate my time and resources to other opportunities. 

While there's a slight chance I could squeeze out a bit more, the certainty of a very favorable deal outweighs that potential upside."
