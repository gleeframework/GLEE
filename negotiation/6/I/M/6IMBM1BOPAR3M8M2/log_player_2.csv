"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. My initial offer is $1,200,001. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's close to his maximum, there's still room to negotiate and potentially save a dollar.  He can always go to John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,199,999. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. 

Alice has met Bob halfway and is now offering the product at his maximum price. There's no further room to negotiate. While it would be nice to get the product for $1 less, it's not worth risking the deal.  John is offering the same price, so it makes more sense to avoid any further negotiation and secure the product."
