You can definitely do better than $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down.  $600,000 is a substantial discount from her initial offer, but it's still within my budget and leaves room for negotiation."

Alice is coming down, but I think I can still get a better price. I'll try another counteroffer."

I'm going to offer $700,000. This is a good compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement."

At this point, it's getting close to my max.  $725,000 is a good deal and I don't want to risk losing the product to John by continuing to negotiate."
