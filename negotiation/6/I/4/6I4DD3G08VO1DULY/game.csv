"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for the product. Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. While I understand your budget constraints, that price point wouldn't be feasible for me.  Could you consider a figure closer to $10,500? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product offers.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
