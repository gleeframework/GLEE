Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $12,000. I believe it offers significant value, even above this asking price."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This allows room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you come down in price.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price, even if vague, can make Bob take the offer more seriously.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While we want to maximize profit, we always have the option of selling to John for our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for the product. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $6,000 is far below our minimum of $10,000. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a considerable gap between his offer and our starting price. By rejecting, we signal that we're serious about a higher price and encourage him to move closer to our range.
* **John as Backup:** We still have the safety net of selling to John at $10,000 if negotiations with Bob completely stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. While I understand your budget constraints, that price point wouldn't be feasible for me.  Could you consider a figure closer to $10,500? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product offers."", 
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Above Minimum:** We've made a significant drop from $12,000 to $10,500, showing flexibility. However, we remain  firmly above our $10,000 minimum. 
* **Justification:** We're re-emphasizing the product's value to justify the higher price in Bob's mind.
* **Guiding Upwards:** By suggesting a price of $10,500, we're aiming to nudge Bob's counteroffers upwards and closer to our acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unlikely to Reach Agreement:** Bob's offer of $7,500 is still significantly below our $10,000 minimum. He has not shown a willingness to move substantially closer to our price range.
* **Avoiding Wasted Time:** Further negotiation with Bob is likely to be unproductive and time-consuming. 
* **John Guarantees Acceptable Price:** We have a guaranteed offer from John at $10,000, which meets our needs. It makes more sense to take the sure thing than to risk a lower outcome with Bob."
