"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing terms further."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with an offer significantly higher than your minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), you establish a strong anchor point. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and set the stage for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""exceptional value"" adds perceived value and justifies the high initial price.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  While starting high, you signal flexibility by mentioning your willingness to discuss terms. This encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but it's not worth that much given my budget and other investment options. I could consider a price closer to $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum price and your initial offer. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While his message expresses interest, it also attempts to anchor the negotiation very low.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate him up before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective.  However, $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  I've done extensive research and analysis, and its unique features justify a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget considerations."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection & Acknowledgment:** You politely but firmly reject Bob's low offer while acknowledging his perspective.
* **Justification:** Reiterate the product's value and your research to support your higher price.
* **Significant Concession (but not too much):**  You drop by $200,000, demonstrating flexibility but also signaling that you're serious about a reasonable price. 
* **Framing as Compromise:** Presenting your counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" encourages Bob to reciprocate with a more serious offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the price is still too high for me. While I recognize its value, I have budgetary constraints.  I'd be willing to go up to $950,000. This offer represents a significant investment on my part and seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, but it's still significantly below your minimum. It seems like he's testing your resolve and hoping you'll settle for a lower price. You have a guaranteed offer from John at your minimum, so there's no need to rush into a deal with Bob. You will continue to negotiate strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  However,  the gap between $950,000 and my valuation is still significant. This product represents a unique opportunity that rarely comes along, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal.  I'm willing to consider $1,250,000.  This is a final concession on my end, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Movement but Reinforce Position:** You acknowledge Bob's price increase but reiterate that it's still not meeting your valuation.
* **Highlight Scarcity and Value:** Emphasize the product's uniqueness and the missed opportunity if Bob doesn't take the deal, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Firm Counteroffer:** You slightly reduce your previous price but frame it as a ""final concession"" to signal your strong position.  You're now very close to your absolute minimum price, but by presenting it this way, you maintain a chance of Bob meeting you closer to your target. 
* **Time Pressure:** With five rounds left, introducing a sense of urgency might push Bob to make a more competitive offer in the next round."
