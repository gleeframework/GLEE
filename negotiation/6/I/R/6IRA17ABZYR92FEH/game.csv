"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing terms further.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but it's not worth that much given my budget and other investment options. I could consider a price closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective.  However, $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  I've done extensive research and analysis, and its unique features justify a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the price is still too high for me. While I recognize its value, I have budgetary constraints.  I'd be willing to go up to $950,000. This offer represents a significant investment on my part and seems like a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  However,  the gap between $950,000 and my valuation is still significant. This product represents a unique opportunity that rarely comes along, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal.  I'm willing to consider $1,250,000.  This is a final concession on my end, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
