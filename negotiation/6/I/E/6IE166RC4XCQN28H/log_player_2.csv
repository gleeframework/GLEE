"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since you don't know Alice's value for the product, there's a chance she'd accept a lower counteroffer.  Rejecting her offer allows you to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it establishes my intent to negotiate aggressively.  If Alice is willing to sell for significantly less than her initial offer, she might accept this. If not, we can continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price range, I'm still going to reject it. I believe there's room for further negotiation, especially since she already lowered her price once.  I'll aim for a counteroffer closer to my initial offer of $300,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a good deal. $350,000 is a good midpoint between my initial offer and Alice's latest offer, giving her an incentive to accept while still saving me a significant amount of money compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now closer to my desired price range, and we've been negotiating for a while.  It's getting closer to what I'm willing to pay. It's also likely that if I reject this offer, Alice might not budge further, and I would end up paying the full $1,000,000 to John. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price and avoids the risk of losing out on a deal."
