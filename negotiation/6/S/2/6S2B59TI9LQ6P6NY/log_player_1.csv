{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'd love! I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a price that is closer to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) to maximize my profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A $10,000 offer gives Bob room to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal, while still leaving me with a profit significantly higher than my minimum. 
* **Friendly tone:** Keeping the message friendly and encouraging can help foster a positive negotiating atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While $8,000 is my minimum, it doesn't leave me with much profit. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob clearly values the product at $12,000, so there's a good chance I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding immediate sale:** Selling to John now would mean missing out on a potential profit from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to go up to $9,500?  That would still be a significant savings for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting halfway between my initial offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($8,000).
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm highlighting the savings for Bob, making it more appealing to him.
* **Maintaining a fair profit:**  $9,500 is still above my minimum and allows for a reasonable profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $9,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my desired price:**  $9,000 is very close to my desired price of $10,000.  
* **Good profit:** This offer significantly exceeds my minimum of $8,000, giving me a good profit margin.
* **Avoiding risk:** While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and a good profit."
