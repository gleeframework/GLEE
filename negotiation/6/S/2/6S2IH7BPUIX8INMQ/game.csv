"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is unique, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1100000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $950000. Is that something you'd consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $1050000 is a more reasonable price for this product. It's a fair middle ground, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I've made a serious offer of $950000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm starting to think that this product might not be worth the investment. I'd like to make one final offer of $980000, and if that's not acceptable, I'll be forced to walk away and buy from John for $1000000.",980000.0,Bob,6,
