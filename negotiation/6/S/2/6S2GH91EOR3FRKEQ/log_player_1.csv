Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  Starting with a price of $150 offers a 25% profit margin if Bob accepts. This is a reasonable markup for many products.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob doesn't accept $150, the offer opens the door for negotiation. He might counter-offer, giving you the chance to still get a price higher than $120. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's willingness to pay beyond the $120 baseline. If you had more information about Bob's preferences or the market value of the product, you could adjust your offer accordingly."
