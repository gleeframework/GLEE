Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I've got to make a profit. I can do $110, and that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

While $110 is closer to your ideal price, there's still room for negotiation before resorting to John's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still think $105 is a bit low. I can do $115, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $115 is a reasonable price within your budget. It's better to accept now than risk the negotiation breaking down and having to pay John $150."
