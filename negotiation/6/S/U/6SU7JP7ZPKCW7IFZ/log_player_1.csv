Let's see how Bob responds!  We've started high, but left some room to negotiate knowing his value is $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to offer $12,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is a good profit, I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob before accepting his offer or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13,500?"", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

We're aiming to meet somewhere in the middle. This maintains a strong profit margin while still being appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking of making another counteroffer. I'd like to offer $12,800 for the product. I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm willing to negotiate further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly interested and getting close to his budget. Accepting $12,800 provides a strong profit and avoids the risk of pushing him away entirely."
