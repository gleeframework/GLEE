{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. I'm offering it to you for $1,350,000.  Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, there's no reason to offer it to Bob for less.  We start high to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,350,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still securing a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses positive language and emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Important Note:**  While John guarantees a sale at $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob quickly might be preferable to avoid potential delays or complications."
