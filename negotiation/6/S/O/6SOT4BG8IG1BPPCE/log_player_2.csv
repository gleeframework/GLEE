"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay $10,000 for the product from John, and Alice's offer is also $10,000, it makes no difference who you buy from. You're getting the same price either way. However, the prompt specifies that your goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since there's no potential to save more money, you might as well buy from John."
