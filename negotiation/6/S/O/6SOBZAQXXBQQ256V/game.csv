"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand that $1,500,000 was a bit steep for you, but $500,000 is still a bit low considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a little on the price.  However, $1,250,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $1,250,000 is still a bit high for you, but $750,000 is getting closer to the minimum value I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're still not willing to pay that, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
