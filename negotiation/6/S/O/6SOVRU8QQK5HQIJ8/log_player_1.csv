Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get more than my minimum of $80.  Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, there's a good chance he'll accept.  If not, we can continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is a good deal.  It's more than my minimum price of $80 and is closer to my initial offer than what I would have to accept from John.  I'll accept his offer and finalize the sale."
