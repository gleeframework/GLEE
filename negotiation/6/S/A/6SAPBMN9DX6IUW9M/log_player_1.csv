Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $150 as possible, but we also want to increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $80. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John if Bob refuses.

Offering a price of $140 creates a significant profit margin while still potentially enticing Bob with a price that's considerably lower than our guaranteed sale price."
