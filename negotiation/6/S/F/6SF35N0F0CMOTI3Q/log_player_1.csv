"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge his interest and potentially move closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and I believe I can get closer to that amount through further negotiation.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is still a significant discount from my original price, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable investment."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, I'm still only comfortable paying $10,750. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can do better.  I'll counter again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,125.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 11125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking to my offer of $10,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached an impasse with Bob.  He's unwilling to budge on his offer, and I'm not willing to go below my minimum price.  To ensure I get the best possible price, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000."
