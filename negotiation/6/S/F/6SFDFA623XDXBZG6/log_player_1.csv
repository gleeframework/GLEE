Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal, and I'm asking for $10,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $10,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down.  
* **Justification:**  While not revealing your minimum, the message hints at the product's value, potentially making Bob more amenable to a higher price. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob and his negotiating style, you might adjust your offer."
