Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product and believe it would be a great asset for my company.  To make this work for me, I'm prepared to offer $1,450,000.  This reflects a fair value for the product while remaining within my budget.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can negotiate a higher price. I've got 8 rounds left, and I believe I can still convince him to pay closer to my initial offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,450,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  It's a unique opportunity that will bring significant benefits to your company.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be compensated fairly for its exceptional qualities.  I'm offering a revised price of $1,600,000.  This price allows for a mutually beneficial deal and ensures both of us get what we need."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget.  I believe we are close to a deal, and I'm confident that this product would be a great fit for my company.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering $1,550,000. This price is fair and within my financial limits. I'm optimistic that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.
