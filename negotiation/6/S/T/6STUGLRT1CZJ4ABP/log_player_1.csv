Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than Bob's estimated value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging.  I'm also highlighting that the price is good for both of us. This could make Bob more likely to accept the offer.

**Why not go higher?**

While I could start with a higher price, there's a risk Bob will immediately reject the offer. By starting a bit lower, I increase the chances of starting a negotiation that could lead to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me.  

I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $700,000 is a bit lower than I'm aiming for, I'm willing to consider $900,000. This price is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $900,000.  This is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and encouraging. I'm also reiterating that the price is a good deal for Bob, even if it's higher than his initial offer. This helps maintain a positive tone during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is closer to my desired range, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  

Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm better off selling to John and avoiding further negotiation with Bob. This ensures I get the best possible price for my product."
