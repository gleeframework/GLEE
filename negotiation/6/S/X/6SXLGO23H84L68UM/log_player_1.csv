Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $500,000 to be made if you can sell it above your minimum.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but you also don't want to price Bob out completely.  Here's a balanced approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Confident:** The message is clear and positions the product as high-value.
* **Price Justification:** While not explicitly stated, the message implies a strong rationale behind the price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The price allows for some negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you. Bob might counter-offer, and you have room to potentially meet in the middle.

**Important Considerations**

* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower price.
* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start even higher to provide more negotiation space. 

**Remember:** This is just one offer strategy. The best approach will depend on the specific context and your relationship with Bob."
