"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $700000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can meet you halfway and offer you the product for $825000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than $825000. I'd be willing to pay $775000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value you're offering, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're serious about purchasing the product. However, $775000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer it to you for $820000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm afraid I have to pass. I'm willing to pay up to $800000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value you're offering. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
