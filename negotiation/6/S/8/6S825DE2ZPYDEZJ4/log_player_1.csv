Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,000,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000, ensuring a good profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so he has room to negotiate and still make a profit. 

By starting with a higher offer, you can potentially get closer to Bob's value and maximize your profit. However, if he rejects, you have the backup of John's $800,000 offer."
