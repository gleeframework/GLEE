$200 is way too high, so I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
``` 
I'm starting with a pretty low counteroffer of $60, seeing how much wiggle room there is.  I know that's below my $80 limit, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."

$170 is still too expensive. I'll reject the offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}

I'm going to go all in with my maximum price of $80. I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, but if not, I'll just buy from John at that price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice is not willing to budge much, and I've already reached my limit. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
