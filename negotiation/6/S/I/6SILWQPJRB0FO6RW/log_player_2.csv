Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $100. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. Hopefully, this will be a good starting point for negotiations."

This is getting too close for comfort.  I don't have many rounds left and I'm not sure I can get Alice down to my price.  I'm going to buy from John for $120.  It's not ideal, but it's the best I can do."
