"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you first.  I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $120 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but the product is worth more to me than that. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. This is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum of $100.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $100 from John."
