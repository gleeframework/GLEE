"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far more than Bob is willing to pay. It's time to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500 at this time."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $16000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a slight improvement, $16,000 is still too high.  He's willing to go to John, so he should continue to negotiate with Alice to get closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $12,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm looking for in this product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $14000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his target, $14,000 is still too high. He should continue to negotiate, but if Alice doesn't come down further, he's close enough to his target to seriously consider going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  However, $14,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm firm at $10,000. This is a fair price considering we're both trying to reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $13000. It's still a good deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. I'm trying to find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's goal, he has only 3 rounds left.  Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, but it's unclear if she'll go lower.  Since Bob can get the product for $8,000 from John, it's time to cut his losses and go with the sure thing."
