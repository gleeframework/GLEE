"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Could we settle around $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $650,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This price reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $925,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high. How about we settle at $750,000? That feels like a fair price to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is unfortunately still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $850,000?  This would be a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within your budget.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
