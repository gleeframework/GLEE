"Bob, I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. It's a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,350,000 for the product.  This still leaves you with a substantial profit margin and gives me a price I can work with. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,325,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
