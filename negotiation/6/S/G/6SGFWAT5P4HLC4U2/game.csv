Given its unique features and potential for your business, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  To kick things off, I'd like to propose an initial price of $2,000,000.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to offer $600,000 to start the negotiation.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 is significantly below the product's value and what I'm willing to accept.  Let's find a middle ground.  Would you be open to a price of $1,700,000? This offer takes into consideration the potential benefits this product offers your business while still reflecting its true worth.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position on the product's value.  To be frank, $1,700,000 is still significantly outside my budget.  Would you consider $700,000? I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  How about we meet halfway?  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is my absolute bottom line. This is a significant discount and a very fair offer considering the value this product brings.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
