"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  To kick things off, I'd like to propose an initial price of $2,000,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to offer $600,000 to start the negotiation."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 is significantly below the product's value and what I'm willing to accept.  Let's find a middle ground.  Would you be open to a price of $1,700,000? This offer takes into consideration the potential benefits this product offers your business while still reflecting its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your position on the product's value.  To be frank, $1,700,000 is still significantly outside my budget.  Would you consider $700,000? I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  How about we meet halfway?  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is my absolute bottom line. This is a significant discount and a very fair offer considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her bottom line of $1,500,000. This is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and John's offer. It's unlikely Alice will move much further, and continuing the negotiation might not yield a satisfactory outcome.  You're better off taking John's guaranteed offer at this point."
