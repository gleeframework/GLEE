"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $15,000 to us, but considering its value to you, we're willing to start negotiations at $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in, and we can discuss further details.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. After considering your offer, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. I would like to counter with a price of $11,000 for the product. This still reflects its high value to us, while providing a more reasonable price for you. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That seems like a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
