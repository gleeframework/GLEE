"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $15,000 to us, but considering its value to you, we're willing to start negotiations at $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in, and we can discuss further details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to get a better price from Alice. $12,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, which might encourage her to negotiate further. At the same time,  $9,000 is a reasonable starting point for me, leaving room for me to potentially meet in the middle if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. After considering your offer, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. I would like to counter with a price of $11,000 for the product. This still reflects its high value to us, while providing a more reasonable price for you. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to my desired price range, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

We've now hit a critical point in the negotiation. Offering $10,000 is a strong signal that I'm serious about buying and am willing to be reasonable, but it's also a firm stance on not paying more than necessary. Let's see if Alice is willing to accept."
