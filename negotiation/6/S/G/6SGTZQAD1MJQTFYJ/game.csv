"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1,750,000 is still above my maximum budget. Let's compromise at $1,400,000. This represents a significant move from my previous offer and is closer to a price we can both agree on.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,400,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything below $1,600,000 for this product. It's a final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the immense value it brings.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're committed to this price, but I'm still hesitant at $1,600,000.  I'm willing to go to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and it's a significant step closer to your last price.  Let's finalize the deal.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
