"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $16,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $16,000, I'm trying to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired range. While it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it's a starting point. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  This first offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to purchase. If he outright rejects it, I know I might need to adjust my strategy significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Far Too Low:** Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly below both my minimum ($12,000) and his perceived value ($8,000). Accepting would be a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a large gap between our positions, indicating significant room for negotiation. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but not to $6,000. 
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 provides a safety net. I don't need to accept a low offer out of desperation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $6,000 is significantly below the value of this product. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This is a very competitive price for what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 14000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** I reduced my price by $2,000, showing willingness to negotiate but not desperation. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** The new price is still comfortably above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reinforcing the product's value to justify the price and potentially nudge Bob closer to his perceived value of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, and $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind. To be completely transparent, my budget allows for $7,000.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer has increased, $7,000 remains significantly below my $12,000 minimum. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Bob revealing his budget could be a genuine attempt at transparency or a negotiation tactic. I need to see if he's willing to move further.
* **John Option Remains:** I'm comfortable rejecting this offer knowing I have the security of selling to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget.  However,  $7,000  is still quite a bit below what I can accept.  Perhaps we can meet in the middle? How about $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a more significant concession this time, bringing the price down by $3,000 to show flexibility. 
* **Nearing the Bottom:** This offer is getting very close to my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize this as a serious attempt to close the deal.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" I'm framing the negotiation in a way that encourages Bob to make a similar size concession."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $11,000 is closer, but still a stretch. I could potentially do $7,500. Do you think that could work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unlikely to Budge:** Bob has only increased his offer by $500, even after I significantly lowered mine. This suggests he is not willing to move much closer to my minimum.
* **Time is Valuable:**  We've spent several rounds negotiating, and I'm not confident Bob will reach an acceptable price within the remaining rounds. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John offers a sure $12,000, which is a significant profit over Bob's current offer and avoids the risk of further unsuccessful negotiations. 

It's time to cut my losses with Bob and take the guaranteed deal with John."
