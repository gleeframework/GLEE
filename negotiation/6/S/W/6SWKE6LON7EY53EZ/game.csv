"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $850,000. It's a steal considering its true value! I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm willing to pay no more than $750,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $825,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. I think that's a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I value your interest and see your effort to find a compromise.  However, $775,000 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm prepared to go down to $800,000, which is my absolute bottom line. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and a price that reflects the product's worth.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",800000.0,Alice,5,
