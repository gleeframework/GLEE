Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. It's higher than my minimum, but I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal selling price.  This initial offer will gauge Bob's interest and potentially initiate a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $175 is closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I believe I can do better, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm counteroffering with $190. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be closer to a price we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $180.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering I'm still making a profit and avoiding the hassle of further negotiation.  It's also higher than what John would offer."
