Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. This is a limited-time offer, so what do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as much as possible from Bob, knowing she has a guaranteed sale of $15,000 from John.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit than selling directly to John. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a quick decision. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:**  This offer assumes Bob is somewhat risk-averse and might be willing to pay more than his perceived value to avoid losing the deal.
* **Negotiation:** Alice should be prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects the initial offer. She can gradually lower the price, but never below $15,000 to ensure she makes a profit."
