"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a decent price, it's still above your maximum value of $120.  You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price of $110, which is still within my budget and represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer. This should give Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially save some money."
