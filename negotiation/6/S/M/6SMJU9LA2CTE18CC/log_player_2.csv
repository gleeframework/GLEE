"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's much better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's room to bargain."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This price is fair and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price gap is still significant.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the true value of the product.  I'm open to further discussion, but I'm confident this is a fair offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price.  It's worth trying to negotiate a bit more, especially since we know she's willing to come down from her initial asking price.  We can likely find a price that works for both of us."
