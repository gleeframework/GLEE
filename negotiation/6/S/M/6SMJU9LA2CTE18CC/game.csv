"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This price is fair and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price gap is still significant.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the true value of the product.  I'm open to further discussion, but I'm confident this is a fair offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This represents a significant compromise and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  I'm confident we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
