"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but it's not the best possible deal.**  You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate.** This gives you plenty of time to try and get a better price.
* **Buying from John is the worst-case scenario.** You want to avoid this option if possible.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can start the negotiation process and try to get a price closer to $1,000,000, which is closer to Alice's minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:**  $900,000 is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still shows that you're serious about buying the product.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to counter back, keeping the negotiation going. 
* **Stay within your budget:**  $900,000 is well below your maximum price of $1,200,000, giving you a comfortable buffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is a fair compromise:** It's closer to your initial counteroffer of $900,000, and still well within your budget.
* **You're likely to get a better deal than buying from John:**  Accepting this offer would save you $175,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Time is a factor:** You have 7 rounds left, but there's no guarantee that you'll get a better price with further negotiation.

While you could try to negotiate further, the potential gains are small compared to the risk of losing the deal or running out of time. Accepting Alice's offer is a smart move in this situation."
