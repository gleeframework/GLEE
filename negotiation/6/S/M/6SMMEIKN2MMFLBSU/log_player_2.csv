"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,750,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I can't go as low as $1,000,000.  The product holds significant value for me, and I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still allows me to achieve my goals, and I think it's a fair compromise.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. It's worth trying to negotiate further.  There's still room to lower the price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's find a way to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear your position, and while I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway,  $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,200,000? This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe we can both walk away happy with this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,200,000 is getting closer, it's still over his budget. He's already made a counteroffer at $1,100,000, and it's worth trying to see if he can push a bit further.  He's only got a few rounds left before he'll have to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $1,100,000. It's a fair price, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can reach a deal before I have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
