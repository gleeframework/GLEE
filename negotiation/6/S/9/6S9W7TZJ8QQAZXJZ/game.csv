"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $750,000 undervalues the product significantly. I could meet you halfway at $875,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I still think $875,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, but that's my final offer. I hope we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
