"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is slightly lower than her product's value to her, it's still significantly more than your $80 limit and what John offers. Buying from John gets you the best price."
