"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get close to my desired price. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using a positive tone and highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $14,000 is not my absolute bottom line, leaving space for potential counteroffers and negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $12,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  Bob's offer shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. There's potential to find a middle ground. 
* **Time to Counter:** Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and explore a price that's more favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $13,500? This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $13,500 is still above Bob's perceived value of $12,000, ensuring I get a decent profit.
* **Encouraging Agreement:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to push Bob toward accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $13,000. How about $12,800? I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time to Counter:** I'm still confident that I can get a better price. Rejecting allows me to counter and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Risk of John:** While selling to John would guarantee my minimum price, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds with Bob to see if I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. How about $13,200? This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good outcome. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a commitment to compromise. 
* **Approaching My Minimum:** $13,200 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, making this offer a more favorable option for me.
* **Encouraging Finality:**  I'm expressing hope that this offer will lead to a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $13,000. How about $12,900? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm concerned that I might not reach my minimum price with Bob.
* **Risk of Further Compromise:**  Bob's offers are still below my desired price, and there's a risk that continued negotiations might result in an even lower offer.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This is the most secure option at this point.
* **Minimizing Potential Loss:** While I would prefer to get closer to my initial goal, it's more important to avoid a sale below my minimum and secure a guaranteed profit."
