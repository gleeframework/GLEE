"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $140. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $150 from John, and Alice is offering it for $140. While this is a better price than John's, you still have room to negotiate down further. Rejecting Alice's offer might push her to lower the price to get your business."
