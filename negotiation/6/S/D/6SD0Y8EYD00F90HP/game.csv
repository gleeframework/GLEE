"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  I believe it has tremendous value for you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can work something out.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm proposing $1,100,000.  This price is still fair and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  While $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000.  Let's try to finalize this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
