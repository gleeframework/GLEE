"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $10000, and I'm willing to make a concession to make the deal happen.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your desire to sell. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $12000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. This is a fair compromise considering the value to you and my minimum price.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $16000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, $14000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value to you and my minimum price.",16500.0,Alice,5,
