"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand the value of the product, your initial offer is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make sure I get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is significantly lower than what I need.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This reflects the product's value to both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee of a better deal. Selling to John would net me the same amount, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
