"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's no reason to buy from John yet, as you have 10 rounds to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I understand the value of the product, your initial offer is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is significantly lower than what I need.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This reflects the product's value to both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. You can still potentially negotiate a lower price, so it's best to reject the offer and continue negotiating.  There's no need to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
