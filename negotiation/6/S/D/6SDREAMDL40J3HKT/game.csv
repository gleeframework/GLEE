"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get us started. My initial offer for the product is $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. My revised offer is $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price, considering I'm already paying above my initial target. Let's try to close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $875,000 yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. My next offer is $885,000 for the product. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",885000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to pay $870,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this agreement.",870000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make a profit. My next offer is $880,000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. Let's see if we can seal the deal.",880000.0,Alice,7,
