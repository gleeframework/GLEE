"I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, but $950000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your seriousness in pursuing a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's value and the market conditions, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $900000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $875000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
