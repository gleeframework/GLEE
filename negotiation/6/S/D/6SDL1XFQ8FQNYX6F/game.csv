"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $10000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $12500 to make this deal work. It's a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still allows me to earn a fair price for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $12500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make an offer of $11250. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price",11250.0,Bob,4,
