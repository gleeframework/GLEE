{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! However, $13,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $10,500?"",

``` 

This counteroffer aims to significantly lower the price while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,750.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you considering the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

Alice is coming down, but the price is still above John's price. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. How about we settle at $11,250? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 11250
}
```

This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's current offer and your previous offer.  It keeps the negotiation moving while still striving for a price below John's offer."
