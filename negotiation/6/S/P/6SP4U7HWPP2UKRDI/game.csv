"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your desire to stay within budget, however, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I could be flexible, but I can't go as low as $10,000. Would you consider $12,500?  This offer reflects a significant discount while acknowledging the value you'll gain.",12500.0,Alice,3,
