Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too high to scare him off. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value.  I'm going to counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 
I'm aiming for a middle ground between Bob's offer and my minimum price. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Bob while still giving me a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$102.50 is above my minimum value of $100.  I'm not sure I can get a better deal from Bob, and it's risky to keep rejecting offers.  It's time to close this deal."
