"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a little more than I'm hoping to spend. Could we try $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,000. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get from this product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
