"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the suggestion, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle. I can do $10,250, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a compromise. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm sensing we're getting closer. I'd be willing to go up to $9,900.  This offer reflects my strong interest in the product while respecting my budget.",9900.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I need to let you know that I'm getting a bit concerned about the time and potential other interested buyers. This is my final offer for now.",10000.0,Alice,7,
