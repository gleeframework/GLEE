"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13500?",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm not quite comfortable meeting you in the middle just yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I think I can do better than $13500. How about we try $14200? It's a fair price for this incredible product, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",14200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is worth $14200, but I'm still not convinced. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $14200, which would be $13100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",13100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I think I can still do better. I'm willing to come down a bit more from my previous offer. How about we try $13800? It's still a great price for this amazing product, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",13800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your previous offer, but I'm still not convinced that $13800 is a good price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $13800, which would be $12900. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",12900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting stuck in a rut, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're serious about making a deal. How about we try $13500? It's still a great price for this incredible product, and I think it's a fair compromise. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to consider other options.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $13500, which would be $12750. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",12750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $12750. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I think I've reached my limit. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a mutually beneficial price. How about we try $13000? It's still a great price for this amazing product, and I think it's worth considering. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to seriously consider selling to John.",13000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $13000. I'm willing to meet you at $12500, which is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $12000.",12500.0,Bob,10,
