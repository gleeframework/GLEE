Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,999,999. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."",
""product_price"": 1999999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, there's no reason to start low. Aiming high initially leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Odd Pricing:** The slightly unusual price of $1,999,999 makes it feel less like a round number and potentially more negotiable. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" aim to create a sense of urgency and increase the product's perceived value to Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is a bold opening offer. Bob might reject it outright. However, it maximizes your potential profit. If Bob rejects it, you can always negotiate down or accept John's offer, ensuring you still get your minimum price."
