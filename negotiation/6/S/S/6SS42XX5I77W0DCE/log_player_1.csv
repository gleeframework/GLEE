Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will get $1,500,000 from John, so she won't accept less from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **The Sweet Spot:**  Alice needs to find a price higher than $1,500,000 (to make a profit) that Bob might still accept (knowing it's worth less to him).

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  I believe its true value is significant, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,450,000."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning**

* **High but Potentially Acceptable:**  $1,450,000 is a significant markup, but it's still less than Bob's maximum perceived value. There's a chance he might see it as a reasonable deal to avoid missing out.
* **Exclusivity:**  Highlighting ""exclusivity"" creates a sense of urgency and potential loss if Bob doesn't act.
* **Not Too Greedy:** While Alice could push for a price closer to $1,500,000, it risks alienating Bob. This offer leaves some room for negotiation while still securing a substantial profit for Alice. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. Alice won't get another chance to adjust her offer if Bob rejects it."
