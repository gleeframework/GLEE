"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,800,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget, and he can get the product from John for a much lower price.  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Bob's initial counteroffer is $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and a good starting point for negotiation. It leaves room for both parties to compromise and potentially find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer again. While it's lower than her first offer, it's still above his maximum budget of $1,200,000. He can still buy the product from John for a cheaper price. It's better to continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a lower price, or go with John if he's not willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

Bob increases his offer to $1,100,000. This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product and is willing to pay more than his initial offer, but he's still trying to stay within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although it's lower than her previous offers, it's still above his maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's better for him to continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a lower price, or go with John if she doesn't budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

Bob is making his final offer at his absolute maximum budget. This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept and make the deal or risk losing the sale.  He's hoping that she will be willing to compromise and accept his offer, but if not, he has a backup option with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,480,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,480,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's latest offer is still higher than his maximum budget, and he has already reached his limit with his counteroffer.  It's now clear that Alice is unwilling to come down to his price, so he's better off securing the product from John at his pre-determined price of $1,200,000."
