"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I believe a price of $14,000 would be fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good deal, you can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice. You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice wants $8,000. There's room for both of you to make a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is quite a bit below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,500 is a good compromise.  It's a significant discount from her initial offer and still allows you to save $2,500 compared to buying from John.  There's a good chance that you could continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting your next offer and potentially going back to her original price of $14,000 is too high.  Accepting her offer at $12,500 is the safest and most efficient choice."
