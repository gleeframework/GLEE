Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
