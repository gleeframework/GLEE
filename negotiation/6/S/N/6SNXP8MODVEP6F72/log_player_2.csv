"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth more than what you're willing to pay.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal. He has 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for $8,000, so it makes sense to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, as a sign of good faith.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his $8,000 limit. While Alice has come down to $9,500, there's still room for negotiation. Bob has multiple rounds left and the option to buy from John, so he can continue trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can both be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
