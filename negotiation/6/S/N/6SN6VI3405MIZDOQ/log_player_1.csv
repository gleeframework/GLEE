Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I believe you could really benefit from it. I'm asking for $10,000. I know it's a significant investment, but I truly believe it's worth it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with your true value ($10,000) sets a strong anchor point for the negotiation.  Even though Bob's perceived value is lower, you haven't left any money on the table upfront.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Highlighting the product's benefit to Bob emphasizes its worth, potentially shifting his perception of the value slightly upward.
* **No Justification:**  You don't need to justify the price yet. Let Bob respond first, and you can adjust your approach if needed.

**Important:** This is a starting point.  How Bob responds will determine your next move. Be prepared to potentially negotiate, but always keep your minimum acceptable price ($10,000) in mind. You have a guaranteed sale at that price with John."
