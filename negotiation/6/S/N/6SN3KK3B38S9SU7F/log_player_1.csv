"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$8,000 is significantly less than my minimum, so I cannot accept. I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum price of $12,000. This is a firm price, but I'm still willing to negotiate with Bob if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$9,000 is still too low for me. I'll reject and counter again.  I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to give up just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to drop my price to $11,000. This is a good compromise, and I think it's a price Bob might be willing to accept.  I'm also getting close to my minimum, so I don't want to go lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still not acceptable. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob for a higher price.  I have a few rounds left, so I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to drop my price to $10,500. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I hope Bob sees that I'm serious about closing the deal.  It's close to my minimum, but I still think there's room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 2 rounds remaining, the negotiations with Bob are getting too risky.  He's not willing to budge much from his offer, and I'm getting close to my minimum. To avoid the chance of ending up with less than my minimum, I will sell the product to John for $12,000. It's not ideal, but it's the safest choice at this point."
