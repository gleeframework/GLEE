"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $175. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in!",175.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the willingness to meet me halfway, but $175 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to get even closer to my target price. How about $155?",155.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $155 is still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $165. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm willing to meet you at this point. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in!",165.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $165, but I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'd like to try to get as close to $150 as possible. How about $160?",160.0,Bob,6,
