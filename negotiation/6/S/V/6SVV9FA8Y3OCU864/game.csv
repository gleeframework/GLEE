"I understand you're looking to spend closer to $8000, but I have to consider my costs and make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit more than that. How about $8500?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still only comfortable paying $8000.  I know that's your bottom line, but I'm hoping we can find a way to bridge the gap. ",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised by offering $8500 in the last round. I'm willing to meet you at $8200, but that's as low as I can go. I'm confident you'll find this price reasonable, considering the value the product will bring to you.",8200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping we can find a way to agree on $8000. I know it's close to your bottom line, but this is the absolute most I can afford. ",8000.0,Bob,6,

"I've already compromised significantly by offering $8200, and I've made it clear that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation. I'm willing to give you one last chance, but I need to get at least $8300. If not, I'll have to consider other options. Can you meet me at $8300?",8300.0,Alice,7,
