{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  I believe its value to you is significant, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob, or at least get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your interest, $1,200,000 is significantly lower than the value I need to receive.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This price still allows me to make a decent profit while giving you a fair deal. Let's see if we can agree on this compromise."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I can't go higher than $1,300,000.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to try to get a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'm willing to drop down to $1,400,000. This is a significant concession, but I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm getting closer to my budget, but $1,400,000 is still too high. I'm prepared to offer $1,350,000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to consider it, I think we can finalize this deal.  If not, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $1,500,000, Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is a decent compromise.  It's above my minimum of $1,500,000, and I'm running out of negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer is the best option in this situation."
