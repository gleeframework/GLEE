"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth the full $13,000. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  This product offers you substantial value, and I'm confident it's worth a considerable investment on your end. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm not willing to go above $10,500. Can you meet me at that price?",10500.0,Bob,4,
