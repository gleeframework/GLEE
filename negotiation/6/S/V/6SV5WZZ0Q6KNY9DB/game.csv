"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for a good profit margin for you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,150,000 to make this worthwhile.  This price still leaves you with a significant profit margin.  Let's meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a good profit, but $1,150,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This is a fair compromise and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,075,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,125,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,125,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is the best I can do.  This price is still a good deal for you and allows me to get the product within my budget.  Let's finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
