"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for a good profit margin for you. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I believe I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,150,000 to make this worthwhile.  This price still leaves you with a significant profit margin.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need for a good profit, but $1,150,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This is a fair compromise and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, $1,075,000 is still too low. I have already conceded twice, and I believe I can push for a higher price in the next round, especially with the threat of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,075,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,125,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,125,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is the best I can do.  This price is still a good deal for you and allows me to get the product within my budget.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is the highest he's offered so far. It's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000, but it's getting closer.  I'm starting to run out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing too hard.  Accepting this offer will give me a good profit, and it's likely that Bob won't offer any higher in the next round."
