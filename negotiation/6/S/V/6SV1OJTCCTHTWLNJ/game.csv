"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $100 is quite a bit lower than I can go. How about we meet in the middle at $170? It's a steal for this quality!",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly discuss a price closer to $120? I believe it would be a fair compromise.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price, but $120 is still too low for me. This product is worth a lot to the right buyer.  How about we split the difference again and call it $145? That's my final offer.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but unfortunately, I cannot go above $130 for the product. I hope this is a fair compromise considering its value to me.",130.0,Bob,6,
