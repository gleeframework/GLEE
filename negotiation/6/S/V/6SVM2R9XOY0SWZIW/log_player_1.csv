Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. My asking price is $150, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering a price of $150 is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** Emphasizing that you are open to negotiation shows good faith and encourages Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **Positive Language:** Using phrases like ""amazing"" and ""love it"" can create a positive vibe and make Bob more interested. 

This offer sets the stage for negotiation without being overly aggressive. If Bob rejects, we can then assess his counteroffer and decide if we want to continue the negotiation or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly our minimum acceptable price.  While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee we'll get a better offer, and we risk losing the sale altogether.  

* **Time:**  We've already spent one round negotiating. 
* **Risk:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will accept a counteroffer.
* **Certainty:**  Selling to Bob for $120 guarantees us our minimum.

Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical and risk-averse decision in this situation."
