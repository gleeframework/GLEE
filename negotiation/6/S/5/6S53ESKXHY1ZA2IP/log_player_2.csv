"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $90.  It's a good deal, but there's room for negotiation, and Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Therefore, Bob will reject the offer and try to get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $75? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50? It's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $82.50 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. He will reject the offer and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $82.50 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $80.  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 80}
