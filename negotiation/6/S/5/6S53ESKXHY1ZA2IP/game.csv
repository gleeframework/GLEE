"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $75? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50? It's a fair price considering the product's value.",82.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $82.50 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $80.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
