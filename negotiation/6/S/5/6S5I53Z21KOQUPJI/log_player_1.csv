"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** I'm framing the high price with the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly suggesting it might be worth more than Bob initially thinks.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob's thoughts, showing I'm open to discussing the price and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial deal.

By starting high, I can gather information about Bob's willingness to pay and adjust my strategy accordingly in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make a smart business decision. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price and his own stated value of the product. This suggests he's trying to negotiate a heavily discounted deal. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm serious about the product's worth and willing to walk away from a lowball offer. I'm confident I can still negotiate a better price, either with Bob or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your initial interest."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging & Reframing:**  I start by showing Bob I heard his offer and understand his perspective. However, I immediately reframe the conversation back to the product's ""true worth and potential,"" subtly pushing back against his low valuation.
* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:** My counteroffer is a substantial drop from my initial price, signaling flexibility.  However, it remains significantly above both Bob's offer and my absolute minimum, ensuring I'm still in a strong negotiating position.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** I'm explicitly positioning this counteroffer as an attempt to ""find a middle ground."" This emphasizes fairness and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a more reasonable counter-proposal. 

This strategy aims to keep Bob engaged while clearly communicating my bottom line is significantly higher than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I still think $1,200,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met my absolute minimum price. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher amount in subsequent rounds, there's a risk he might walk away or hold firm at $1,200,000. Accepting now guarantees I achieve my minimum acceptable outcome, and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
