Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe its value is well worth the price, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. My initial offer is $1,000,000.  Let's discuss further and see if we can find a price that works for both of us.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $600,000 is significantly below the product's actual value and my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, reflecting a compromise on my side. This price still allows for a significant profit for you and ensures a smooth transaction for both of us.  Let's work together to bridge the gap.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $700,000 is still far from what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Considering the unique features and potential value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects a substantial compromise on my part, but it's also a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's reach an agreement and finalize this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000. While she might budge a little more, it's not worth the risk of the price staying above your $800,000 limit. John offers a guaranteed price that meets your needs. It's time to cut negotiations with Alice and secure the deal with John."
