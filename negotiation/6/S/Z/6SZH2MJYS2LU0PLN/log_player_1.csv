"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe its value is well worth the price, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. My initial offer is $1,000,000.  Let's discuss further and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to build rapport and hopefully encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I'm indicating my willingness to negotiate, signaling that I'm open to finding a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I believe the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is far too low, it does indicate a willingness to negotiate. I want to see if I can push him closer to my desired price. 
* **Selling to John is a safety net:** I know that I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,200,000, so I can afford to be a bit more flexible with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $600,000 is significantly below the product's actual value and my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, reflecting a compromise on my side. This price still allows for a significant profit for you and ensures a smooth transaction for both of us.  Let's work together to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with justification:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but providing a counter-offer that is significantly higher than his offer but still lower than my initial offer. I'm justifying my offer by referencing the product's ""actual value.""
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm emphasizing the benefits for both of us with this price, hoping to appeal to Bob's rational side.
* **Bridging the gap:** I'm using language like ""compromise"" and ""work together"" to signal that I'm open to further negotiation but still holding firm on my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. This demonstrates my seriousness in purchasing the product, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $700,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **John's offer is better:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,200,000, which is far more profitable than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Time for a higher counter-offer:** While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, I need to see if I can push him closer to my desired price. 

I'm confident that I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round by counter-offering with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $700,000 is still far from what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Considering the unique features and potential value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects a substantial compromise on my part, but it's also a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's reach an agreement and finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with justification:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer again but providing a counter-offer that's closer to his offer while still staying above my minimum price. I'm justifying my offer by referencing the product's unique features and potential value.
* **Emphasize compromise:** I'm highlighting my willingness to compromise and signaling that I'm open to a deal.
* **Focus on a win-win:** I'm emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement, hoping to appeal to Bob's desire to get a good deal. 
* **Show urgency:** I'm adding a sentence about finalizing the transaction to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer."
