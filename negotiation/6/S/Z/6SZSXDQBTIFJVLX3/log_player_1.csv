Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) maximizes potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially negotiate down, making him feel like he's getting a slightly better deal.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000 provides a safety net. This offer to Bob aims significantly higher, reflecting the product's higher potential value to him."
