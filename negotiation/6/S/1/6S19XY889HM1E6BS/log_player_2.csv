At this point, Alice has drawn a line in the sand and called $7,250 her final offer.  While you could continue negotiating, you're running the risk of her sticking to her guns and you having to settle for John's $10,000 offer.  It's better to accept the $7,250 and secure a good deal rather than risk overplaying your hand."
