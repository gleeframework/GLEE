,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell it to you for $12,000, which is the lowest price I can go. If you're still not interested, I'm open to further discussion.",12000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I can do $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from there.",11000.0,Alice,5,
