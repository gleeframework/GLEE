"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $16,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $11,500?  I think that's a fair offer.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still quite low considering what you're getting.  How about we settle at $14,000? This offer stands as a compromise and reflects the true value of the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
