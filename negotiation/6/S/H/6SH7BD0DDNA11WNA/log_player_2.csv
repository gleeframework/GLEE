"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. This is a great opportunity to get a product that will benefit your business immensely. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. While her offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have a backup option with John for $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price or move on to John and secure the product at your maximum budget."
