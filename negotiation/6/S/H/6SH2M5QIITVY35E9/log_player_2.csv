"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. Given its high value and quality, it's worth $12,000 to you. I am offering it to you at an exceptional price of $9,500, which I believe is a fair deal considering its worth and the benefits it will bring to you. I look forward to hearing your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $12,000.**  You're looking to save money.
* **You can get the product from John for $12,000, which is within your budget.**

Therefore, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John, even though it's the higher price, because it still fits within your financial constraints."
