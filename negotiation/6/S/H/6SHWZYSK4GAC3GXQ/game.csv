"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $850,000? I think it's a fair compromise that would allow us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $875,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if this works for you.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $825,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
