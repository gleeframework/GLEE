"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable deal. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $125 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $135?  I'm hoping we can close this deal soon.",135.0,Alice,5,
