Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. I'm willing to go down a little from my initial offer, but $1,300,000 is too low."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $1,325,000 is still too low, and I think I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm confident we can reach a deal in the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate you coming closer to my asking price.  However, $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to meet my goals and you to acquire the product at a competitive rate."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

At this point, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. It's close enough to my desired price, and we're running out of rounds.  It's better to get $1,337,500 than risk losing the deal altogether and having to sell to John for a much lower price."
