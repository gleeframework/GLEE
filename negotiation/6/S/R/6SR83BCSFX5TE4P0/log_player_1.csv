Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.
