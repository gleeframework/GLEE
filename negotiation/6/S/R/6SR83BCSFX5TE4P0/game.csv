"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a fair compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to offer you a revised price of $875,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
