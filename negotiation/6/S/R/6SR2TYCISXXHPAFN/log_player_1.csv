Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $140. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below John's offer leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate up, getting you closer to your maximum profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  While $80 is Bob's valuation, he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the product as highly valuable or unique.  

This strategy aims to find a balance between securing a deal with Bob and maximizing your potential profit."
