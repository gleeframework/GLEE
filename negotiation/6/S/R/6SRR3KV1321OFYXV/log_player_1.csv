"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening position, as it immediately establishes a high value for the product. It's important to remember that Bob's value for the product is unknown.  This high initial offer allows room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for more. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push the price closer to my initial ask."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than $850,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $900,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer is a good outcome, considering my minimum value for the product is $800,000.  It's a good balance between potential gains and the risk of going through more rounds and potentially losing out on a sale."
