"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a one-time price of $12,000. It's a steal at this price, considering its worth to you is $15,000. I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say, Bob? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $15,000 from John. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale."
