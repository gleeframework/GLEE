Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have strong interest from another party."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, securing a deal with Bob at a higher price is ideal.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significantly higher profit than John's offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning another interested party creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to accept the offer quickly. 

This approach attempts to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and ensuring a successful sale by appealing to Bob's perceived value of the product while setting a clear and enticing offer."
