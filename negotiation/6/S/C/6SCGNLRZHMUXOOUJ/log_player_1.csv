Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before it hits the open market. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it at the special price of $14,999. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, getting even slightly more from Bob is preferable. 
* **High but Reasonable:**  Starting at $14,999 is a strong opening offer. It's just below John's price, suggesting a deal to Bob while still leaving room for potential negotiation if needed. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the product's benefit to Bob, aiming to justify the price and encourage acceptance."
