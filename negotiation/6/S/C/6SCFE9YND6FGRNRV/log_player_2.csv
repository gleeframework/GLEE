"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

The product is worth $80 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $120.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $100? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

While $100 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He should continue negotiating to try to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
