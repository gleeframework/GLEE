Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $100. I think it's a great deal and I'm hoping you'll find it valuable as well."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Leave Room for Bob to Negotiate:** Offering $100 allows Bob to potentially counter-offer, and you can still meet your minimum of $80 if necessary. 
* **Appear Confident:** By setting a higher initial price, you project confidence in the value of your product. 

Remember, this is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly if Bob counters, but don't go below your $80 minimum as you have a guaranteed buyer in John."
