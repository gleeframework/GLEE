"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $18000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $19000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique value. Let's make this deal!",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  However, $17500 is still too low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $18500. This is my final offer, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us.",18500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you have your budget, but I'm not willing to go lower than $17500. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's be realistic, and make this deal happen. I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.",17500.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm going to lower my price to $17000. This is the absolute lowest I can go.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't regret. If you decline this offer, I'll have no choice but to accept John's offer.",17000.0,Alice,9,
