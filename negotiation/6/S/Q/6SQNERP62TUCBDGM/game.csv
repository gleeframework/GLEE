"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would really benefit you and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. As a starting point, I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Would you be willing to come down to $7,500?  I'm very interested in the product, and this price would make it a worthwhile investment for me.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $7,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,750? I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's try to split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $8,250 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach an agreement.",8250.0,Bob,4,
