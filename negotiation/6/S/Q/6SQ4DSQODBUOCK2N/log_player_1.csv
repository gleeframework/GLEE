Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $18,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  Could you meet me halfway at $20,000?  I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $20,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $19,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could continue negotiating, securing $19,000 at this point is a good outcome. It's a significant profit above Bob's perceived value and getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Continuing the negotiation has risks: Bob might lower his offer or I might have to settle for a lower amount as rounds progress."
