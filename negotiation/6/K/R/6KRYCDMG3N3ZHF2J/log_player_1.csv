Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $175, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message clearly states that I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts and potentially negotiating.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while still keeping the negotiation open. I'm prepared to potentially lower the price if Bob counters, but I want to see if he's willing to pay closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, his message indicates a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range. This keeps the negotiation alive and potentially leads to a more favorable outcome.

Selling to John would secure a guaranteed $150, but I believe there's still potential to earn more through negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum price. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $175 to $125. This shows good faith and encourages Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Value proposition:** I'm reiterating that $125 still represents a good deal for Bob.
* **Clear expectation:** I've stated my minimum price ($125) to prevent further back-and-forth. 
* **Focused message:** I'm keeping the message concise and focused on the price, avoiding unnecessary chatter.

This strategy aims to find a compromise point that's acceptable to both of us while still ensuring I get a reasonable price for the product."
