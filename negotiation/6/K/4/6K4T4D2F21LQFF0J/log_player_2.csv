Considering its worth to you and our mutual interests, I propose a transaction price of $1,350,000 for the product. This offer strikes a balance between the intrinsic value of the product and the price you are willing to pay, aiming to ensure a fair exchange for both parties. I look forward to discussing this further and potentially closing this deal with you.
