Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $140."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $140 is higher than your minimum of $120, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $140 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $150, so he has an incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counter-offers, you have space to either accept a higher price or make a counter-offer of your own.

This approach balances maximizing your profit with keeping the negotiation open for a potential win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay $130 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer of $140. Rejecting his offer allows you to maintain your bargaining power and potentially reach a higher price.  You can then counteroffer with a price closer to your desired $140, keeping in mind that a significant gap could risk losing the sale altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $130 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $135? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. However, I am still looking to keep my expenses lower. I am willing to pay $132 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While a higher price would be ideal, Bob's offer of $132 is only $2 less than your previous counteroffer of $135.  This means the negotiation has narrowed significantly, and further rounds are likely to result in smaller price changes.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit of $12 above your minimum, which is a good outcome given the limited room for further negotiation."
