"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you as well. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $9,500 to make this worthwhile. It's a fair price, considering the value of this product to you. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this transaction and make this happen.",9000.0,Bob,4,
