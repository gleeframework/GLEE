Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I know it's worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Gives Bob a good deal:**  $10,000 is significantly less than the product's value to him ($12,000).
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** You can still increase the price if Bob counteroffers. 
* **Protects your minimum:** You're still making a profit ($2,000) above your minimum value. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you as well. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I can still potentially get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $9,500 to make this worthwhile. It's a fair price, considering the value of this product to you. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this transaction and make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant profit for me, and it's still a great deal for Bob. Accepting this offer ensures a quick sale and maximizes my earnings."
