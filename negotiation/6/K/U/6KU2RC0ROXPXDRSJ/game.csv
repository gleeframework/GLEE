"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
