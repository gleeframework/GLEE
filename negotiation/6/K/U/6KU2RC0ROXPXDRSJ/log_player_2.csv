"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $11,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is higher than Bob's maximum price.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This is a strong opening position to establish Bob's willingness to negotiate and hopefully create some room for a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above Bob's desired price.  There's room for further negotiation, and Bob is still committed to getting the best deal possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully reach a price closer to $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is proposing a price that is exactly in the middle of his last offer and Alice's last offer. This shows Bob's willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good deal. This also puts pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the deal."
