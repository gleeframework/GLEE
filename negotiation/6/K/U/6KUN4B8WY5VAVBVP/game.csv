,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I've done some research and I believe the product's value is not as high as you think, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but not that high. Can we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,300,000. It's a good compromise that allows us both to walk away with a solid deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can we meet at this price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and $1,250,000 is closer to what I'm looking for. However, I'm still not quite there yet.  To make this deal work, I'd need $1,350,000.  This would allow me to meet my financial goals while still offering you a good value.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet your financial goals, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000, but no higher. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Can we meet at this price?",1280000.0,Bob,6,
