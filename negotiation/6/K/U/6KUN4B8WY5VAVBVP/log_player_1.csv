Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I've done some research and I believe the product's value is not as high as you think, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but not that high. Can we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
