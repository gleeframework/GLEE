{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $800,000, ensuring you'll make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $1,200,000 is significantly less than the $1,500,000 Bob values the product at, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  The message is direct, outlining the offer and leaving the ball in Bob's court. 

By starting with this offer, you create space for negotiation while still securing a good potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its true worth to me. How about $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly less than what you initially offered. You can potentially get more. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $900,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

This counteroffer is a good compromise:

* **It's a step towards Bob's offer:**  $1,050,000 is closer to his offer of $900,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still above your minimum:** You're not giving up too much, ensuring you're still making a substantial profit.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  The message outlines the offer and suggests a middle ground, keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, I still believe there's room for negotiation. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to your desired range, it's still quite a bit below your initial counteroffer. It's worth pushing for a little more, as Bob clearly sees value in the product. You can likely get a higher price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still below my ideal price point.  Given the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000.  This is a fair compromise for both of us, and would ensure a successful transaction.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

This counteroffer is designed to push Bob to the limit without risking the deal entirely:

* **It shows a willingness to compromise:**  You've come down from $1,050,000 to $1,000,000, demonstrating a genuine desire to find common ground. 
* **It highlights the value to Bob:**  You remind him of the product's worth to him, subtly increasing the pressure to reach an agreement.
* **It frames it as a final offer:**  The message hints at a finality, urging Bob to consider the deal seriously.

With this offer, you're aiming for a successful negotiation while securing a good price for the product."
