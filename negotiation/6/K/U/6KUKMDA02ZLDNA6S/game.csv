"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its true worth to me. How about $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $900,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your response, Alice. While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, I still believe there's room for negotiation. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still below my ideal price point.  Given the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000.  This is a fair compromise for both of us, and would ensure a successful transaction.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
