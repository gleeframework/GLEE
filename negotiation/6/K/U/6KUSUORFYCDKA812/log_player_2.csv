"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I will reject Alice's offer and send a counteroffer. I don't think $1,100,000 is a good price for me, considering the product is worth $800,000 to Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice. Since the product is worth $800,000 to her, I'll offer $900,000, which is a 17% discount from her original offer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $900,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's counteroffer is still too high for me. I'll reject her offer and think of a new counteroffer. I'll aim to get even closer to the product's value to her.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to negotiate further. Since Alice's last offer was $1,050,000, I'll make a counteroffer of $950,000, which is another 9.5% discount from her last offer.
