"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11000. It's a great deal for both of us - I get a good price, and you get a product you value at $10000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you wanting to make a deal.  However, I'm only willing to pay $9,500 for the product.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10250. This gives you a good price, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum value, it's still above his desired price. Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer and continuing negotiation will likely result in a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,750. This is a fair compromise that lets us both get a good deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down to $10000. This is my final offer - it's a great deal for you, and it lets me hit my minimum target. Let's finalize this! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is exactly Bob's maximum value for the product.  There's no incentive for Bob to reject this offer and continue negotiating as he's already at his limit.  Buying from Alice at this price is the best outcome for Bob as it allows him to get the product for his maximum value and avoid potentially losing the product to John."
