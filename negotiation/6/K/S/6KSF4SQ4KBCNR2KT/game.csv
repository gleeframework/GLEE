"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That would still leave you a good deal, and it's a fair price for me.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my time.",105.0,Alice,5,
