I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and gauge his potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,400,000 is still a good price, but I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $1,450,000.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,350,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet. I want to see if I can push for a better price before resorting to selling to John.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a final compromise, meeting Bob's previous offer halfway. I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal and avoid selling to John for the lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is too low for me. While I would like to get a better price, it seems like I've reached a stalemate with Bob.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000 to avoid further negotiation and ensure a sale."
