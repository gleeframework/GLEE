"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,
