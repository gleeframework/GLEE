Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $110 is better than nothing, I can potentially get closer to my target price of $120.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $120.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round.  There's still a possibility that I could get a better deal with Bob, or I can always sell to John for my minimum price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. This is a fair price, and it's a good value for a product like this.  Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 110}

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $108 is still not quite there for me.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer you the product for $110. This is a fair compromise, and it will allow both of us to walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 110}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $107 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John for $120.  We've been through several rounds, and Bob is not budging much further on his price. While I could continue to negotiate, there's a good chance that we'll run out of rounds without reaching an agreement.  It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John than risk getting stuck with a lower price."
