"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1050000, which is a compromise that I think we can both be happy with. Let me know if this is something you'd like to accept.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850000.  This is my final offer, so let me know if it's something you can accept.",850000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1000000, which is my absolute minimum. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,,
