Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,800,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (your own valuation and John's offer), you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Anchoring:** By initially offering the product at $1,800,000, you set a high anchor point. Even if Bob negotiates down, the final price is likely to be significantly higher than $1,000,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high price leaves room for negotiation, making Bob feel like they are getting a deal if they manage to bring the price down. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you are comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer.  You have a strong fallback option with John, allowing you to confidently aim high with Bob."
