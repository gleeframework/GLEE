"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully maximize my profit.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Open Ended Question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and allows me to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $200 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to do $150?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:**  While $150 is my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low for my desired profit margin.  Rejecting Bob's offer gives me the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially secure a better price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell and maintain some leverage in the negotiation. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** In the next round, I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. This gives Bob room to bargain while still allowing me to potentially earn more than $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. $150 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $175.  That's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight Value:**  I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that $175 is still a good deal.
* **Maintain Confidence:** My message conveys confidence in the product's worth, which might encourage Bob to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, Alice, but $175 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $160. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $160 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Final Offer:**  Bob has stated this is his final offer.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a higher price.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're already in round 4, meaning I have limited rounds remaining to close a deal.  Selling to Bob now ensures I secure a sale and avoid potentially losing the opportunity to John.

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale with a profit and minimizes the risk of ending up with no sale at all."
