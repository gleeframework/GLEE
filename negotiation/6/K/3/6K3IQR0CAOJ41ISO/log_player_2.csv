"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's far above his budget and there's no reason to accept it at this point. He has plenty of rounds to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its potential and my financial limitations."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the unique advantages this product offers. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a slight improvement from the initial offer, it's still above his budget. There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if he can get a lower price.  He can make a counteroffer closer to his desired price point."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. I believe it's a fair price considering both our positions."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This reflects my commitment to getting this deal done while acknowledging the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, it's still higher than he's comfortable with. He should try to negotiate further to see if he can get a lower price. There are still a few rounds left, and he might be able to close the deal for closer to his target price."
