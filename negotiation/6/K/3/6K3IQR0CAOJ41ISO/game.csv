"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its potential and my financial limitations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the unique advantages this product offers. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. I believe it's a fair price considering both our positions.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This reflects my commitment to getting this deal done while acknowledging the value of this product.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to reach an agreement. However, $1,700,000 is still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to pay $1,550,000, which reflects a significant compromise on my part.  I believe this price fairly represents the value of the product and allows us to close this deal.",1550000.0,Bob,6,
