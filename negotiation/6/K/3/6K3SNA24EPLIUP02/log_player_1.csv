"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not starting at my absolute minimum, leaving room for negotiation in case Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  While selling to John for $12,000 is tempting, I still have 8 rounds left. There's a chance I can negotiate a better price with Bob.
* **Counter-offer strategy:** I'll counter-offer with a price closer to my minimum to see if I can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price reflects the value of the product, and it would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  I'm increasing Bob's offer by $1,500. This is a significant jump but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving a little room for negotiation to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Positive and Encouraging Tone:** I'm continuing to be positive and encouraging to foster a collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $9,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is progressing:** While Bob's offers are getting closer, there's still room for improvement.
* **Time to counter:**  I'll counter-offer again, aiming to get closer to my target price while leaving some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,125? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 10125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to see the offer as fair.
* **Positive and enthusiastic tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward."
