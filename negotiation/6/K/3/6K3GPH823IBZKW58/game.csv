"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I think it's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to being able to make this work. Would you consider $900,000? That would make a big difference for me.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $900,000 is a significant improvement, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I hope you can meet me at this price.",925000.0,Alice,5,
