"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This represents a substantial compromise, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing your perspective.  While $1,600,000 represents a premium price for a premium product, I understand your initial offer might not reflect the full value you see. To move us closer to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,450,000 is still beyond my acceptable range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which reflects a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your increased offer.  However, the value of this product is significant, and I need to see that reflected in the final price.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I'm willing to consider.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
