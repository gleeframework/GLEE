"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. After considering your potential interest, I'd like to make an offer to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

Alice is meeting my maximum price. There's no point in haggling further, especially since John offers the same price."
