"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. After considering your potential interest, I'd like to make an offer to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for starting the conversation, Alice! I understand the product's value, but  $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Could we work towards a price closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
