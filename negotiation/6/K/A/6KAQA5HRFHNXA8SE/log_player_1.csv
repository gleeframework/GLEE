"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will find value in the product, and this price is a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. However, I am looking for a lower price. How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $95 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob or, if necessary, sell to John for my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $95 is a bit too low for me. How about $105? It's a fair price that allows me to make some profit and you still get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 
 
I'm aiming for a compromise by meeting Bob halfway, offering a price closer to his offer but still above my minimum. I'm optimistic that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $100 instead. This feels like a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me.  $100 is above my minimum and close to the middle ground I was hoping for.  I'm happy to close the deal now rather than risk further negotiation."
