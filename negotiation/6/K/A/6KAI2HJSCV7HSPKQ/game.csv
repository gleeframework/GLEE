,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this deal work for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $925,000?  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of this product to your company.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $875,000 is still significantly lower than the value this product brings to your company. Let's find a compromise.
