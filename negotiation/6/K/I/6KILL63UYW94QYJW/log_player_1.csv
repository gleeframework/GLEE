"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also positions the product as valuable and worth the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum desired value of $15,000. I have 9 rounds left, and I can still potentially get a better offer from Bob or simply sell to John. It's too early to settle for a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet at $11,500?  It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, I still believe that $10,000 is a reasonable price for the product. Could we perhaps meet at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough.  I have 6 rounds left, and I still have the option of selling to John for $15,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob and see if I can get him to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. To be fair, I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. How about $11,250? It's a good compromise and brings us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can close this out."", ""product_price"": 11250}
