"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet at $11,500?  It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, I still believe that $10,000 is a reasonable price for the product. Could we perhaps meet at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. To be fair, I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. How about $11,250? It's a good compromise and brings us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can close this out.",11250.0,Alice,5,
