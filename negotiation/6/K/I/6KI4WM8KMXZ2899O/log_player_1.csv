{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $100. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $150. I'll reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $120. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $100 is a bit low for you, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $110. Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to save money, but $110 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $115. This is a very fair price considering the product's value and my need to earn a decent profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $112, but no higher. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $112 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough.  I'm starting to feel like this negotiation isn't going anywhere. I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  It's not as much as I'd like, but it's still a better deal than selling to Bob at a lower price."
