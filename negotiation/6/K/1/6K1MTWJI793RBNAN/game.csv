"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $115 is still too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",120.0,Alice,5,

"I'm close to walking away, but I still think we can find a better price. I'm willing to meet you at $118. Can you consider that?",118.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, $118 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $119. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",119.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $117, but that's as high as I can go. Can you reconsider?",117.0,Bob,8,
