"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. To start, I'm offering it to you for $120. This price takes into account its value to both of us and aims to ensure we're both satisfied with the transaction. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product's value, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60?  I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your perspective on the product's value. While I would like to accommodate your budget, I must maintain the product's value. Therefore, I am unable to accept $60. However, I am willing to meet somewhere in between our offers. How about $90 for the product? I believe this price respects both the product's worth and your budget.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand you need to be fair to the product's worth. How about we settle at $75? That feels like a good compromise to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. After considering our previous discussions, I believe a fair price for the product would be $85. This respects the product's value while also being within your budget. I hope this proposal works for you.",85.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $80? That's the highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,6,
