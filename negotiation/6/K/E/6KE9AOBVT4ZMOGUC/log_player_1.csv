Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. This is a great deal considering its true value to me is much higher. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $13,500, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($12,000). This allows for potential negotiation while still maximizing my earnings.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to me to encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously. I also use a friendly tone to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $13,000? This way we both get a fair deal and I can still make a profit. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a compromise price of $13,000, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints while remaining firm on my own needs. I'm also highlighting the benefit of a ""fair deal"" for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $12,800? I'm really interested in the product and I think that's the best we can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to risk losing a sale to John for a lower price. It's better to secure the $15,000 from John than to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price."
