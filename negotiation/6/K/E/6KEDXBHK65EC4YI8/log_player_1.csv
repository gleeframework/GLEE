"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with an ambitious offer. This provides room for potential concessions and allows you to gauge Bob's eagerness and price sensitivity.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""unique value"" and ""potential"" helps justify the high initial price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains collaborative and open to discussion, indicating willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significantly higher profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's counteroffer is significantly below both your minimum and his stated value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.  While his offer is disappointing, it signals that he's very interested. You'll use the next round to counter and try to find a more agreeable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to engage in this discussion. However, your offer is considerably below the product's true value and my initial asking price.  To move things forward, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,900,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, reflecting my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging the Offer:**  You acknowledge Bob's offer to show you're seriously considering his perspective.
* **Justification for Rejection:**  You clearly state that his offer doesn't reflect the value of the product, subtly reinforcing its worth.
* **Significant but Controlled Concession:**  You're making a large drop from your initial price ($400,000) to demonstrate flexibility, but you're still aiming high above both your minimum and Bob's offer. 
* **Emphasizing Mutuality:** Highlighting the desire for a ""mutually agreeable solution"" maintains a cooperative tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I could meet you halfway at $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met your minimum acceptable price. While you could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk he might lower his offer or walk away. Accepting now guarantees you a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
