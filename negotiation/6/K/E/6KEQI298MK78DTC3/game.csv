"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! I think it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a unique item, and I'm confident you'll be impressed.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $750000 for it, but I'm confident that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering the unique features and benefits it offers.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm confident the product is valuable, but I'm also confident I can find similar products for a lower price.  I'd be willing to pay $800000 for it.  This is a fair offer that demonstrates my seriousness in acquiring the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to meet you at $815000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",815000.0,Alice,5,
