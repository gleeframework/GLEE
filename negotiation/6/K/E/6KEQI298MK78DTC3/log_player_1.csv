Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $750000 for it, but I'm confident that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

This is a fair offer that demonstrates my seriousness in acquiring the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.
