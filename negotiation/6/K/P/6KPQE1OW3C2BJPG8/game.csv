"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,000? It's still a great price for a quality product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $8,750? That's the best I can do.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,750 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more - how about $8,875?  It's a fair price for a valuable product, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $8,750. That's my final offer.",8750.0,Bob,6,
