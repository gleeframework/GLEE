Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

Since I know John is willing to pay $120, I'm offering the same price to Bob. This ensures I get the highest possible price while still leaving the decision to Bob. If he accepts, I make a good deal. If he rejects, I can sell to John without losing money."
