Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but so does my time.  While $1,200,000 is closer to a reasonable price point, it's still beyond my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $700,000. If that's not agreeable, I may have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $950,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $800,000?  That's my final offer – I need to be respectful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has revealed that $800,000 is his absolute limit.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to result in a significantly better outcome. Accepting his offer would mean a $200,000 loss compared to John's standing offer. Selling to John ensures you receive the product's full value to you."
