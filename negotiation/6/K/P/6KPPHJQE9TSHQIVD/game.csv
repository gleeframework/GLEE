"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in purchasing the product for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but so does my time.  While $1,200,000 is closer to a reasonable price point, it's still beyond my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $700,000. If that's not agreeable, I may have to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some urgency on your end and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle – $950,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal with you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $950,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $800,000?  That's my final offer – I need to be respectful of my budget.",800000.0,Bob,6,
