Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, but I'm offering you a preferential rate before exploring other options."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Justification:** Offering a ""preferential rate"" and mentioning ""other options"" subtly implies that you have other buyers (like John) without revealing your absolute bottom line.
* **Psychology:** By aiming high, even if Bob rejects the initial offer, you're anchoring his perception of the product's value at a higher level. This may make him more receptive to a counter-offer within a range closer to your desired price than his initial valuation.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he outright rejects $19,000, you have room to decrease the price and still make a profit above your $15,000 minimum."
