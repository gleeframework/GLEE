"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting high with $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for a potentially strong negotiation. It allows for room to make concessions if necessary, and it establishes a high initial value in Bob's mind. 

**Important Notes:**

*  **Unknown Value:**  I have no information about the value of the product to Bob, so I'm starting with a guess.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob as a buyer with the potential for a higher profit. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 provides a safety net, but I'm aiming higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000.  While selling to John is a safe option, I'm still confident in my ability to negotiate a better price with Bob. 

I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving towards Bob's offer, but not by too much.  $1,750,000 is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Maintaining Value:**  This counteroffer is still above my minimum value of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't settle for less than I'm comfortable with.
* **Signal of Flexibility:**  By making a counteroffer, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal.  I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  Selling to John is still a safe option, but I want to explore all avenues before taking that route."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm continuing to move closer to Bob's offer, but at a slower pace. This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's current offer.
* **Strategic Concession:** By making a smaller concession this time, I'm showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product highly.
* **Creating Pressure:**  I'm hoping to push Bob towards a higher offer in the next round. 
* **Avoiding John:**  While selling to John is an option, I still believe there's potential for a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, but I still believe I can get a better price.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a tempting option, but with only four rounds left, I want to continue negotiating with Bob. 

I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** With limited rounds remaining, I'm making a significant concession to try and reach an agreement with Bob.  $1,450,000 is a compromise between our current positions.
* **Pressure and Urgency:** This counteroffer conveys a sense of urgency and a willingness to reach a deal.  
* **Balancing Risk:**  While I'm getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still aiming for a price higher than John's offer.  However, with only three rounds left, I need to be prepared to accept John's offer if necessary."
