"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you be willing to come down to $8500?  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is limited.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think you'll really love the product at this price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $8750. This is the absolute highest I can go, and I hope you'll consider it. Let's make this deal happen!",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8750. I'm willing to meet you at $9250, which is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9250.0,Alice,5,
