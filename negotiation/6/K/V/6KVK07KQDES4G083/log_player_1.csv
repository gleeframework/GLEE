"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth at least that much to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to get as close to the $1 million mark as possible. This allows me to leave room for negotiation, while still aiming for a significant profit. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more acceptable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, given that we both know the true value of this product.  Let's try to find a middle ground. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit on the price.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $750,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still feel I can get more. I'm going to reject and see if Bob is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a final agreement. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 825000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still think I can get a bit more. I'm going to reject and see if he's willing to increase his offer one last time before I consider selling to John."
