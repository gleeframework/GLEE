"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $175 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $145. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still a little high at $145.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can close the deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $125 is a good one, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $135. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $120.  This is a good middle ground for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",120.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $120 is getting close to what I'm willing to accept, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $130. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",130.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $125 is getting close, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $132. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",132.0,Alice,9,
