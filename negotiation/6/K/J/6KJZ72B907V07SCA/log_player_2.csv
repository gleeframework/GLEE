"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $800,000 is still a significant amount of money, and there's room for negotiation.  He should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while your product is intriguing, $800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $750,000. This is my final offer in this range, so if you're interested, now is the time to make a decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. $750,000 is a good price for him, and he's already saved $250,000 compared to buying from John.  While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and being forced to pay $1,000,000 to John is too high."
