"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to my value.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind. Could you do $9,500? I think that would be a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to bridge the gap. How about $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it's still well below the value you place on the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
