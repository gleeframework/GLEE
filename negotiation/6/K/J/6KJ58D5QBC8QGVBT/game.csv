"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80 for this product. Would you consider selling it to me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $80 is significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit.  Would you be interested in paying $100 for the product? This would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. However, I'm still unable to meet you halfway at $100. Could you consider selling the product to me for $90? This would allow me to stay within my budget while providing you with a fair price.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $95?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth the investment.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating. I'm willing to pay $93 for the product, which is closer to your original offer. I believe this price is fair for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget while still getting a valuable product.",93.0,Bob,6,
