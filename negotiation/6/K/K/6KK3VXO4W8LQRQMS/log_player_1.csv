I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value, giving me room to negotiate, but not so high as to scare Bob off immediately.  I'll see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe there's still potential for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I believe it's a fair price that still allows for some profit on my end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up a bit from his initial offer. While it's not my ideal price,  $1,250,000 is still above my minimum and a decent profit. It's also  risky to keep pushing, as Bob might walk away completely.  I'll accept his offer."
