Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and am willing to consider your proposal. However, I must respectfully decline your offer of $900,000. I am unable to match that price point. Instead, I am proposing a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while acknowledging your budget constraints. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations and enables us to move forward with the transaction.
