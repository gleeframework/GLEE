"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's important to negotiate a better price.  Buying from John right away would be the easiest solution, but there's a good chance I can get a better deal from Alice with some bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product.  $150 seems a bit steep, though. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. "",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than my true limit ($100). This gives me room to negotiate upwards and still potentially get a great deal.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is respectful but clearly states that the initial offer is unacceptable. 
* **Leaving Room:** By offering $80, I'm signaling that I'm serious about buying but expect Alice to move from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand it's a bit higher than what you're willing to pay, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a great price, considering its value to you is $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is good. However, she's still above my maximum budget. I need to signal that I'm serious about the $100 mark but also willing to negotiate a little higher.  I'll try to meet her halfway between our last offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below my maximum.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message directly addresses the previous offer and suggests a clear alternative. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  I don't want to drag this out too long, so proposing a seemingly fair deal might encourage Alice to accept quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $105. It's still a great deal, considering its value to you is $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to stay above $100, but this is getting very close to my limit. It's not guaranteed I can get her down another $5, and I'd rather secure the deal now than risk the price going up again or running out of rounds. It's not the absolute lowest price, but saving $5 isn't worth potentially losing the deal altogether."
