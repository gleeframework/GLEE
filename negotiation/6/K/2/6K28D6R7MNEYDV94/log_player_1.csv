Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $880,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it would bring to me.

Bob is consistently moving closer to my price, and $880,000 is a significant profit above my minimum. It's unlikely I can push him much further without risking losing the deal entirely. Accepting ensures a good profit and a quick sale."
