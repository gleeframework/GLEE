"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you think the price is a bit high, but I believe the product's value justifies the price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth to me is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, anything over $1,000,000 is pushing it for me. How about $900,000? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you are.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you in the middle. I think this is the best we can do, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
