"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $2,000 over your maximum budget. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a middle ground, considering my budget and Alice's likely desire to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750? It's still a good price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still $750 above my maximum.  I'm going to try to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price I'm comfortable with.  There are still multiple rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,750 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's closer to Alice's last offer, but still within my budget. I'm hoping this shows that I'm serious about buying the product and that we're getting closer to a deal.  It also leaves a bit of room for negotiation in the remaining rounds."
