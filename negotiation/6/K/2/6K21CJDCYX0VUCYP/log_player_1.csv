Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750? It's still a good price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10750}
