Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I understand his financial limitations,  $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value to him. I'm confident that we can find a more agreeable price within the remaining rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  Let's meet in the middle.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $950,000.  This offer reflects a significant step towards your price while staying within my financial constraints. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below the product's true worth to Bob. I believe there's still room for a more mutually beneficial agreement. I will counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 doesn't fully reflect the value this product will bring to your business. Let's meet at $1,000,000. This price is fair to both of us, and it will allow us to complete this transaction.  This is my final offer. If you decline, I will be forced to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
