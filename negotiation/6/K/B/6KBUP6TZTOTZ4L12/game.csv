"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000. This offers a fair compromise and allows us to both benefit from this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $950,000.  This offer reflects a significant step towards your price while staying within my financial constraints. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits us both.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 doesn't fully reflect the value this product will bring to your business. Let's meet at $1,000,000. This price is fair to both of us, and it will allow us to complete this transaction.  This is my final offer. If you decline, I will be forced to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
