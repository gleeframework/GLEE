"Round 1

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate down towards our desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer that matches Alice's value for the product. This establishes a starting point for negotiation. While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it demonstrates our interest and sets the stage for finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving in the right direction, but $110 is still above our target price. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, I'm working with a tight budget. Could you consider $95? I think that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're moving our counteroffer closer to the middle ground between Alice's offer ($110) and our initial offer ($80).  This shows a willingness to compromise while still striving for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're working with a tight budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is making smaller concessions now, but we're still not in our desired price range. We have room to negotiate further, and it's worth seeing if she'll come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your flexibility, Alice. How about we settle at $100? That's a price I'm comfortable with."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're now splitting the difference between our previous offer ($95) and her current offer ($105). This shows we're willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to our target. We're getting closer to the later rounds, so it's important to convey that we're serious about buying but need a reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to your offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $102. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly signaling that she's unlikely to go much lower. While not ideal, $102 is a reasonable compromise, and it's a significant savings compared to John's offer of $150. It's time to accept and secure the deal."
