"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's closer to her valuation than mine. I should counteroffer with a much lower price to start negotiating.  I'm far from needing to take John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's much higher than I'm willing to pay. This product fits into a specific budget for me. How about we start at $500,000?"",
""product_price"": 500000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but she's still heavily favoring her own valuation. I need to show her I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't move closer to a reasonable price.  I'll counter with a significant jump, but still well below her last offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me partway, but that price is still not feasible for me. To be frank, I need to be closer to $600,000 for this to make sense.  Are you willing to consider that?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000, which is closer to your desired price. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting much closer to a price I'm willing to accept, but I'm still above my fallback option with John.  I need to signal that I'm serious about my budget and might walk away. A counteroffer slightly below John's price will show her I'm willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me.  Honestly, at this point I need to be closer to $780,000 to justify purchasing from you.  I need to be upfront, I do have other options available if we can't find common ground."",
""product_price"": 780000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $780,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

This is a tough decision point.  Alice is getting very close to John's price. However, I still have a few rounds of negotiation, and pushing her a bit further might yield a better deal.  The risk is that she walks away, but I'm betting she's motivated to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're very close, and I appreciate you working with me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $802,500?"", 
""product_price"": 802500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** By suggesting the midpoint between our last offers, I'm showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below my fallback option.
* **Urgency:** We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. Offering a specific number and framing it as a ""meeting halfway"" could encourage her to close the deal.
* **Risk:** There's a risk Alice might walk away, but it's a calculated one.  She's clearly motivated to sell and we're already below her previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $802,500. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $815,000, which is still a compromise between our previous offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time:** We're down to the last round. It's very unlikely Alice will go below $815,000, even with another counteroffer.
* **Minimal savings:** While getting the product for $802,500 would be ideal, the potential savings of $12,500 aren't worth the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and being stuck with no deal.
* **Guaranteed deal:** John's offer is guaranteed, and at this point, it makes more sense to take the sure thing than risk ending up with nothing after Round 10."
