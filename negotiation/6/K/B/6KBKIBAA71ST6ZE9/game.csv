"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still looking for a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a great deal. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting closer to what you can afford, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
