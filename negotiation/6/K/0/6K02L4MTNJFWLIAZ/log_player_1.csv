"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiations.  It's also slightly higher than what I could sell it to John for, giving me some room to compromise if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm willing to lower my price a bit to $12,500, which is still slightly higher than my minimum price, but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, while still protecting my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although $11,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant.  I want to see if Bob will come up a little more before I consider selling it to John.  It's a risk, as we're getting close to the end of our rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at my minimum price of $12,000.  If Bob doesn't accept, I'll be forced to sell to John, but I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of rounds, and Bob is stuck at $11,000.  I'm not willing to go any lower, so I'll take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
