"Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both parties. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion. ",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also acknowledging its value to you. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,025,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This reflects the value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on this. While $975,000 is closer to my target, I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $925,000 for the product.
