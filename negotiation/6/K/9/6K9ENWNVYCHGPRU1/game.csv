"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let it go for that price.  How about $10,500? It's a fair compromise and still a great deal for you considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. While I'm willing to go a bit higher,  $10,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for it. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my limits. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
