Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so he won't pay more than that.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. This means a deal is impossible unless Bob is willing to pay more than he thinks it's worth (unlikely), or you're willing to accept less than John's offer.

**The Optimal Strategy**

Since a mutually beneficial deal with Bob seems unlikely, your best move is to go directly to John. There's no point in wasting time negotiating with Bob when you have a guaranteed offer meeting your minimum price.

**Offer (Not recommended):**

While it's not advisable to send an offer to Bob, if you were to, it would look like this:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I finalize a deal with another buyer. I believe its true value is significantly higher, but I'm willing to consider a price of $1,450,000 for a quick sale."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Price:** This price is still significantly above Bob's perceived value, making it unlikely he'll accept.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The message creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. However, it's crucial to note that this is a tactic and there's no guarantee Bob will bite.

**Important:**  This offer is risky because there's a high chance Bob will reject it. This would lead you back to John, but your initial attempt to negotiate with Bob might make John question your valuation and potentially jeopardize the $1,500,000 offer. 

**The Best Course of Action:** Proceed directly to John and secure your $1,500,000."
