"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your position, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which reflects the value you'll gain from this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, my budget caps out at $950,000.  If you're willing to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as going lower would be a significant loss for me. Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
