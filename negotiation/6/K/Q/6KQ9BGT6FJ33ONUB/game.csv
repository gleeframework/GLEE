"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product.  While I recognize its potential, I'm looking to invest in it at a price point that's more aligned with my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to invest in the product at a price that fits your budget, Bob. I appreciate your interest and willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I have to consider the value you've placed on the product, which is $1,500,000. Given that, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value while also being more aligned with your budget.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than your last offer. Considering your willingness to meet me halfway again, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,250,000. This price reflects the product's value while also being more aligned with your budget.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer! I truly appreciate your flexibility in bringing the price down. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a final offer from me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
