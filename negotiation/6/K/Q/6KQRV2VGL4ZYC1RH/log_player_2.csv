"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product at a competitive price. I'm willing to let it go for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. It makes more sense to go with John who's offering the product at a price you find acceptable."
