Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm offering it to you for $14,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Anchoring:** The initial price you offer can influence Bob's perception of the product's value. A higher starting point might lead him to counteroffer closer to your desired range. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $14,000, you signal that you're open to negotiation and potentially meeting Bob somewhere in the middle. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is above his perceived value of $10,000, indicating he's willing to stretch his budget. 
* **Below Your Minimum:** Accepting $11,000 would mean selling below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate between your last offer ($14,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($11,000).

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can try to nudge him closer to your desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe its value is closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer proposes a price that's exactly halfway between your last offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's a common negotiation tactic that can signal fairness and a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $12,500 keeps you above your absolute minimum price, ensuring you make a profit.
* **Testing Bob's Willingness:** This counteroffer will help gauge how much Bob is truly willing to pay. If he accepts, you've secured a good deal. If he rejects it, you can decide whether to push further or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but I think that's the maximum I can offer. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Bob has incrementally increased his offer, but he's still $500 below your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Small Gains vs. Guaranteed Sale:** While you might be able to squeeze a little more out of Bob, the potential gain is minimal compared to the risk of him walking away.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for your minimum acceptable price. 

It's time to cut your losses with Bob and take the guaranteed sale with John."
