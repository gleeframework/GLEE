Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is considerably below my minimum. This product has immense potential and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your desire to make a deal, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's becoming clear that we are unlikely to reach a price significantly higher than his current offer within the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer would net us less than what John is offering.  Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to cut our losses and sell the product to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
