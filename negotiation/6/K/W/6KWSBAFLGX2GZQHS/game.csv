"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. This takes into account its unique value and potential. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000 to start negotiations.  I believe this is a fair starting point given its potential value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction, reflecting my desire to find a fair agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but I must be realistic with my budget.  I can increase my offer to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
