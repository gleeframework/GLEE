Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000 to start negotiations.  I believe this is a fair starting point given its potential value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction, reflecting my desire to find a fair agreement."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but I must be realistic with my budget.  I can increase my offer to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he won't go beyond $1,000,000. This is less than what John is offering.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely Bob will drastically increase his offer and we risk missing out on John's guaranteed price."
