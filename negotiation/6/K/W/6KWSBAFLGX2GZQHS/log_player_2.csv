Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction, reflecting my desire to find a fair agreement.
