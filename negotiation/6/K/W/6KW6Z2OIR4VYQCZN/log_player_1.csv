"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. I know the product is worth $80 to him, so I'm aiming for a price that's significantly higher than that but still leaves room for negotiation.  I also want to keep in mind the $150 minimum I'm willing to accept from John, in case things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is above my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm going to stick to my minimum price of $150.  This is a fair price considering Bob rejected my first offer and John is willing to pay that amount. I'm hoping Bob will accept this counteroffer, but if he rejects it, I'll likely sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for the $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher price in the next round. It's getting risky, as we are nearing the half-way point in the negotiation rounds, but I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to make a slight compromise by offering a price of $140. This is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to be flexible. It's also closer to Bob's last offer, which might encourage him to accept. If he rejects it, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $135 isn't my ideal price, it's only $15 away from my minimum and significantly higher than what Bob initially offered.  With only 4 rounds left, I'm risking a lot by continuing to reject offers. It's more likely that Bob won't budge further, and I might be left with only John's offer of $150.  I'll accept this offer to ensure a sale and avoid potential losses."
