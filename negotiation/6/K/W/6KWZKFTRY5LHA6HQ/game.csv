"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $14,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I'm confident you'll see the value in the long run.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  Let's try to close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
