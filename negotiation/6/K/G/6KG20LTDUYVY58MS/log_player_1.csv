{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point. It's  above Bob's valuation but below my minimum. It allows for negotiation and keeps John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a little too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to close the deal, it's below my minimum. I'll counter with a price closer to my valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about $11,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows for a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we are getting closer. I could do $10,000, which is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum.  It's not ideal, but it's a better outcome than selling to John for $15,000."
