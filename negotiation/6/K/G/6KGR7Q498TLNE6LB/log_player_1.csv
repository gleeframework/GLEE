Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it holds equal value to you. To begin, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is still a fair value considering its worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low, and I am not willing to accept it. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. It's important we both see value in this transaction. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. Let's meet halfway on this.  "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a significant step closer to your position. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still too low, although it's closer to my minimum. I'm confident I can get a better price, so I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $950,000 is still below my minimum, but to show good faith, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, and I hope we can reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I truly appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway.  While $1,050,000 is tempting, I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time.  This would allow both of us to walk away with a fair deal, and I believe it's the best compromise we can reach.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer more, it's a fair deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
