"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. I'm willing to be flexible, but I want to start with a strong foundation. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $900000 is a bit above my initial budget. I'd be happy to pay $850000 for it. This price is still well above your valuation and ensures a profitable deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
