Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $900000 is a bit above my initial budget. I'd be happy to pay $850000 for it. This price is still well above your valuation and ensures a profitable deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
