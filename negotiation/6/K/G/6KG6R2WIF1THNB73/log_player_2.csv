"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. I'm willing to be flexible, but I want to start with a strong foundation. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's valuation of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should aim to secure a better deal. It's also too early to consider buying from John as the negotiation has just begun."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $900,000 is a bit above my initial budget. I'd be happy to pay $850,000 for it. This price is still well above your valuation and ensures a profitable deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  Bob's counteroffer is aggressive, dropping the price significantly from Alice's initial offer. However, it's still well above Alice's valuation, making it a fair proposal.
* **Emphasize mutual benefit:** Bob highlights that the deal is beneficial for both parties, emphasizing the profitable nature of the transaction.
* **Open to negotiation:** Bob's message ends with an invitation for further discussion, leaving room for Alice to counter if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 represents a good compromise. It's a significant drop from her initial offer and is closer to Bob's counteroffer.
* **Saving money:**  While not the ideal price, it's still a good deal for Bob as it's significantly lower than his maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to further rounds and ultimately consume valuable time. Accepting the offer now allows Bob to secure the product quickly. 

While Bob might be able to squeeze out a slightly lower price, the potential gains are not worth the risk of further negotiation, especially considering the time constraint."
