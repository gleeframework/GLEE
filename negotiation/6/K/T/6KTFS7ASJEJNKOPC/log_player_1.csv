Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable.  I'm asking for $130. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $150, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $100. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still ensuring you get a significant profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the security of John as a backup buyer, guaranteeing you at least $100. This allows you to aim higher with Bob."
