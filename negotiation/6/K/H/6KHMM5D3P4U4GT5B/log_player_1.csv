Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $180. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible for you to consider $150 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is the highest he's willing to pay, and it's still below my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in further negotiation. Selling to John guarantees I get my desired amount."
