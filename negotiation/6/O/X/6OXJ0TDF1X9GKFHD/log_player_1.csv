Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $2,000,000 is too high for my current budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I hope this is closer to what you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is the most strategically sound option at this stage. Here's why:

* **Profitable:**  $1,600,000 is a significant profit margin, even though it's less than my ideal price. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now is better than potentially losing the sale by being too aggressive. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** There's always a risk that Bob might walk away if I push too hard. Accepting this offer secures a good deal."
