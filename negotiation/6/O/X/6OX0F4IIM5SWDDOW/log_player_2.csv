# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $900,000. I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* Buying from Alice for $900,000 is a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000. 
* Even though you could potentially negotiate with Alice further, accepting her offer still saves you $300,000."
