,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable offer. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a profit, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,025,000 again, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a consulting contract for a year. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
