"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident this is a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  This is my maximum, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is still significantly below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is the absolute minimum I can accept. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let me know if you're willing to consider this.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to offer $925,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 still falls short of my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $962,500.  This price reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's finalize this deal.",962500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $962,500 is still a little too high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $940,000.  This is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired price, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal with this offer.",940000.0,Bob,6,
