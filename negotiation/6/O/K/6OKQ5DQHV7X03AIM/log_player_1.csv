Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will accept no less than $1,500,000 for the product because she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. Any price above this is a loss for him.
* **The Negotiation Gap:** There's a $300,000 difference between what Alice wants and what Bob values the product at. 

**Alice's Optimal Strategy**

Alice's best bet is to offer the product to Bob at a price slightly below his maximum valuation. This makes the deal seem like a bargain to Bob while still securing a profit for Alice.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know its value is significant to you, and I want to ensure a smooth transaction.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,190,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."", ""product_price"": 1190000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Price Point:** The offered price of $1,190,000 is just under Bob's valuation, making it highly appealing.
* **Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to accept quickly without overthinking.
* **Positioning:** The message positions the offer as beneficial to Bob (""smooth transaction,"" ""its value is significant to you"").

**Important Notes**

* This strategy assumes Alice doesn't know Bob's exact valuation. If she did, she could push closer to $1,200,000.
* There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, the chosen price point maximizes the chances of acceptance."
