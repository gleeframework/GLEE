"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from its true potential value, and I'm sure you'll find it to be a great investment. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
