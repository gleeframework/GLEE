,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save some money if possible. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $100, and I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $95. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $98. It's a small compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $98 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $96, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",96.0,Bob,6,
