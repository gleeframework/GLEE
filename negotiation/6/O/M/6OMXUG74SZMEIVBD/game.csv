"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its potential. Let's start there and see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,000,000 represents the upper end of its value, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,750,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
