"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $6,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I'm confident I can get a better price, especially considering John is willing to pay my full asking price. I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,750 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I'd like to get.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also mindful of the fact that I can get my full asking price from John.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. "", ""product_price"": 8000}
