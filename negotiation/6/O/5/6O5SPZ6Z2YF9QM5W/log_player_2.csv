{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $90. This is a good price, but I can try to get it for even less. I'll reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering $80. This is a reasonable price that's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to pay. Hopefully, Alice will accept, but if not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, and $85 is a good price considering the product is worth $120 to me. I'll accept this offer and avoid further negotiation."
