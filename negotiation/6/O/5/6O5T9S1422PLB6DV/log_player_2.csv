Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference again and settle at $100?"",
 ""product_price"": 100
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $100. How about we try to get closer to my initial offer of $150? I'm willing to meet you at $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is clearly trying to push the price higher. It's unlikely she'll go much lower than her current offer of $130.  Since you can buy the product from John for $120, it's better to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed lower price."
