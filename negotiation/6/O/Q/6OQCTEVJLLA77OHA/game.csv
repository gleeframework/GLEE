"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $120.  What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob, but $120 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
