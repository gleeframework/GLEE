Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $125? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go lower and any further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price than John's $120."
