Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $22,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
