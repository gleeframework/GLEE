"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This feels like a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
