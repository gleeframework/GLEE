The product is worth no more than $8,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob, even though it's lower than the initial offer. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price again."

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above Bob's maximum price. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John, guaranteeing a purchase within his budget."
