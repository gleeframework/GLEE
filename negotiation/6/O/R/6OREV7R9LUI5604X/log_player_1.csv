Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,900, which is a very competitive price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11900
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Alice aims to get as close to Bob's $10,000 perceived value as possible while staying above her $12,000 minimum. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to potentially counter-offer,  still giving Alice a chance to land above her minimum.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 gives Alice leverage. She doesn't *need* to go below that price.

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, the potential for a higher profit by starting high is a calculated risk Alice is willing to take."
