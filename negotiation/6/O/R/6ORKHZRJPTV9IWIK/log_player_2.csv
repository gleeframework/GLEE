"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be around $100 to you. To start, let's aim for a fair price. How about we discuss it at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we discuss the product at $105 instead of $90? I believe this is closer to the value you see in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're making progress, but $105 is still above our target price. We have rounds to spare and can try to negotiate further before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $97.5?"",
""product_price"": 97.5
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to come up with a solution that works for both of us. Considering our previous discussions, how about we set the price at $102.5? This is a step towards meeting in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is slowly lowering her price, we're still not at a point where it's significantly better than John's offer. We need to push a bit more or consider John's offer soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm ready to close this deal soon, but I need the price to work for me.  Could you do $99? That's a firm offer."",
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Strategy:**

* **Firm Offer:** By stating this is a ""firm offer,"" we signal to Alice we are getting close to our limit.
* **Near Target Price:**  $99 is a good price point. It's a significant saving compared to her initial offer and only slightly above buying from John. 
* **Time Pressure:**  We are past the halfway point in the rounds.  This message subtly introduces time pressure, potentially motivating Alice to concede."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your effort, Bob. Let's try to get closer to each other. How about we agree on $101? This is a reasonable compromise considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly reluctant to go below $100. While we might be able to squeeze out another dollar or two, it's not worth the risk of her digging in further. John's guaranteed $100 price is the better option at this point."
