"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal considering the value it brings to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There are still 9 rounds left, giving Bob ample time to try and lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500. This price is still within your desired range and allows for a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better offer than $11,500, Bob is still aiming to get the price lower. He has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, and with several rounds remaining, he has a good chance of securing a deal closer to his desired $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $10,750. This would be a good middle ground for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and for you to get a fair price. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,900.  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price of $11,500.  While Bob would ideally like to pay $10,500, accepting $10,900 is a good compromise.  It's a fair price for both parties and allows Bob to secure the product at a price that is still below John's asking price. With 5 rounds left, Bob could potentially continue negotiating, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price is too high."
