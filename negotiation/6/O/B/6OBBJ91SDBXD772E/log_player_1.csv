Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget for this purchase. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm not willing to sell for $1,200,000.  I need to at least make a profit.  I'm going to try and negotiate a better price with Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm really not willing to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though - how about we say $1,250,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,250,000 is a reasonable compromise, and it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
