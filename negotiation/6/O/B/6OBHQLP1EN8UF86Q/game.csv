"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand your perspective on the price, however, I'm looking for a price closer to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a healthy margin and me a good deal. Let's reach an agreement that benefits both parties.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $975,000 is closer to what I envisioned, I need to see a number above $1,000,000 for this to work. How about we settle right in the middle at $1,012,500?",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're definitely getting closer. While I appreciate your compromise, $1,012,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. To make this deal work, I'm willing to go up to $995,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe we're within striking distance of an agreement. What do you think?",995000.0,Bob,6,
