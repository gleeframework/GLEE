Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a high starting point, hoping to secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I will counteroffer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to secure a higher price, Bob's offer is getting increasingly low, and the risk of further negotiation leading to an even lower price is too high. I'll sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
