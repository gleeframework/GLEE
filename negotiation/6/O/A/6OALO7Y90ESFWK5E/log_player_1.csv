``` 

At this point, Bob is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I might be able to squeeze out a bit more in the next round or two, there's also a risk he walks away or the deal drags on, leaving me with John's lower offer. Accepting $1,380,000 ensures a good profit and a quicker, less risky sale."
