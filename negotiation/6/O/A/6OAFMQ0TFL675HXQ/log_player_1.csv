Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a sample offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so this is your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.  This doesn't mean he'll pay that much, just that it holds that value for him.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about your deal with John. This is your leverage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob some perceived ""surplus"" â€“ the feeling that he's getting a decent deal. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm valuing it at $950,000. I believe this represents a fair price for the benefits it offers.  Are you interested in discussing further?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Subtly implies scarcity and value.
* **High Anchor:** Starting at $950,000 sets a strong initial point. 
* **Value Focus:** Emphasize the ""unique value proposition"" instead of just listing features.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The tone is collaborative, not demanding, making Bob more receptive to negotiation.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even higher. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you're on a tight deadline, a slightly lower offer might be strategic.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate! Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how low you're willing to go while still exceeding your $800,000 baseline."
