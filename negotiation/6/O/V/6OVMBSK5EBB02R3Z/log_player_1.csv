Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""deal"" aspect to make Bob feel like he's getting a good price.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to counter, knowing I have a backup buyer in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I'm confident I can get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John is a safe backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Positive framing:** I'm again emphasizing the ""fair"" aspect, encouraging Bob to see it as a good deal for him too.
* **Room for further negotiation:** While $10,500 is still above Bob's initial offer, it leaves room for a final round of negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer.  Could you do $10,200? I'm trying to stay within a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,200 is just slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely:**  It's unlikely that we'll reach a higher price through further negotiation.
* **Avoiding the risk:**  By accepting, I avoid the risk of Bob walking away and potentially needing to sell to John at a lower price. 

Even though I could continue negotiating, it's more beneficial to accept this offer and finalize the sale.  It's a good deal given the circumstances and avoids any potential delays or uncertainties."
