"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a lower counteroffer than you're ultimately willing to pay. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that you're looking for a good deal. 
* **Respectful but firm:** The message acknowledges Alice's offer and expresses continued interest, maintaining a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Strategic positioning:** While $9,000 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, it's still a reasonable starting point considering my budget limit and the backup option of buying from John for $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is meeting me halfway, which is a good sign, but I know I have a backup option at $10,000. It's worth seeing if I can get her closer to that price with one more counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer.  Could you do $10,200? I'm trying to stay within a tight budget."",
""product_price"": 10200
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** Offering $10,200 shows willingness to move closer to Alice's price while still aiming for a better deal.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning a ""tight budget"" reinforces the need for a lower price and adds a touch of emotional appeal.
* **Final attempt:** This counter-offer is a strategic move to see if Alice is willing to budge a little more before I resort to buying from John."
