,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about $130? I'm genuinely interested in the product and think this price would be fair for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $130 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. I think this is a great compromise that benefits both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's split the difference and go with $140. I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $140 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $155. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",155.0,Alice,5,
