Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, But Reasonable:**  Offering the product at $125 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Above Bob's Value, Below Your Minimum:** This price point is still profitable for you (above your $150 minimum) while being closer to Bob's perceived value ($100).
* **Alternative Buyer Strategy:** You have a safety net with John, who will pay your minimum acceptable price. This gives you leverage in negotiations with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob might outright reject $125. However, this strategy maximizes your potential profit while still offering Bob a price that could be tempting compared to finding a similar product elsewhere."
