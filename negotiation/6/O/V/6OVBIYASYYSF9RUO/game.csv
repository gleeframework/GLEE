"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still aiming to keep my expenses within a certain limit. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle at $8,250? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
