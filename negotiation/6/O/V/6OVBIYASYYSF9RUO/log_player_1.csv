Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $8,000 is my minimum, but I'd like to see if I can get closer to my original asking price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still aiming to keep my expenses within a certain limit. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle at $8,250? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, $8,250 is still above my minimum and a reasonable compromise.  It's better than selling to John for $8,000, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether by continuing to negotiate."
