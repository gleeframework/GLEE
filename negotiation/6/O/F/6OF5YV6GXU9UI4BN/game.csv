"Alice, $15,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale, and $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's still above my budget and would give you a decent profit.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9,500, Bob. However, I'm still not sure if that's enough for me to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider that price?",10500.0,Alice,5,
