"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $170 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $155? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",155.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $152? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. If not, I'll consider selling it to John.",152.0,Alice,5,
