Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $10,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 7

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my target price, $13,500 is still outside my budget.  With only 3 rounds remaining, it's unlikely I'll be able to get her down to $10,000.  It's time to secure the product from John at the guaranteed price."
