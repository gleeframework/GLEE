Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 but leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's valuation of the product at $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is lower than what I consider a fair price. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show my willingness to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer.  This counteroffer is a good compromise between our positions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price.  Selling to John guarantees me a secure sale at a price that meets my minimum requirements."
