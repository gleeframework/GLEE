Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. My starting price is $11,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also expressing confidence in the product and emphasizing Bob's potential as a buyer, hoping to create a positive and collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I still have rounds to go and can always fall back on selling to John for $12,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,800 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,150? This allows both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11150}
```

I'm proposing a middle ground price.  This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'm also reiterating the benefits of the deal for both of us, hoping to build on the positive tone of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $10,900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I have several rounds left and can always opt to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go any lower than $11,000.  This price still represents a great value for you, and it allows me to achieve a fair outcome.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm proposing $11,000, which is still a bit higher than Bob's last offer but demonstrates a willingness to compromise.  I'm emphasizing the value the product offers to Bob and highlighting the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome.  This approach aims to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept my offer before I lose interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $10,800. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000.  Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and we're nearing the end of the rounds.  I'd rather secure the higher price from John than risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price."
