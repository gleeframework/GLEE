"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,200 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,800. That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,800, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,400? I'm confident that's a fair price for the product.",8400.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $8,400 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,600. That's a fair price for both of us, and it's the closest I can come to your offer. Let me know what you think.",8600.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $8,600 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one final offer of $8,200. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from another seller.",8200.0,Bob,6,
