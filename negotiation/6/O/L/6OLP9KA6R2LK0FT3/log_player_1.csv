Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being a significant profit for me. It is also below John's offer, making it a reasonable starting point for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm reducing my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I believe this counteroffer is still reasonable for Bob while also allowing me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low and I'm not confident I can get a significantly higher price from him.  It's time to take the guaranteed profit from John."
