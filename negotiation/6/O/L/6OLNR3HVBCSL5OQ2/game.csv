,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value of this product to me, I'm willing to offer $820,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.",820000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $820,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to be flexible. After reconsidering the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $870,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it.",870000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $870,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $840,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",840000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $840,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $860,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",860000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a fair agreement, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $880,000. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",880000.0,Alice,7,
