"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12800. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to me.",12800.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still a bit above your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'll offer $1250 less than your last price. I'll give you $12350 for the product. That's my final offer.",12350.0,Bob,6,
