Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate. He might counter-offer, giving me a chance to still get more than $15,000.
* **Exceed Bob's Perceived Value:** While Bob values the product at $12,000, my offer aims to highlight the product's benefits to justify a price above his initial valuation.
* **Secure a Deal Quickly:** By offering a price significantly lower than my fallback option (John), I increase the chances of Bob accepting quickly, avoiding potential delays. 

**Important Note:** I'm assuming I don't know Bob's walk-away price. If I knew this information, I could adjust my offer to be just below that threshold."
