"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value speaks for itself, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1,250,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to be responsible with my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position on the budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy it at that price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
