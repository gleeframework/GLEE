(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is a tough call! Bob is holding firm, and while $975,000 is a respectable sum, it's still less than John's guaranteed offer. 

However, rejecting Bob now ends the negotiation, and I won't get a better offer from him.  

```json

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""

While it's tempting to try squeezing a bit more from Bob, the security of John's offer is more appealing at this point.  A bird in hand is worth two in the bush!"
