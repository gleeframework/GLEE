"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming closer to my budget.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a little ways off. Would you be willing to consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I can see that $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",8500.0,Alice,5,
