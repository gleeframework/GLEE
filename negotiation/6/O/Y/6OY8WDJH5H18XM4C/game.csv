"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. What do you say?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $130. It's still a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do right now.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $130 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's a fair offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $120.  This is a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",120.0,Alice,5,
