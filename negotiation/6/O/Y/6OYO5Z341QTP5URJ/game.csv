"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,350,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential gains. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your perspective on the value, I believe this product offers significant potential beyond the price you've proposed. Would you consider $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,275,000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This would allow you to make a good profit while still giving me a fair deal. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
