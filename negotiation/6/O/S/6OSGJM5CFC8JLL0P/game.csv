"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get this deal done.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the concession, but $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your stated value of $1,000,000 and my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its worth to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and the effort I put into acquiring it.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $900,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still only able to offer $875,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering both our respective values for the product. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $875,000 is still below my minimum price. Considering the value I've placed on the product, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
