"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000.  While it's a ""concession"" from her perspective, it's still not in your best interest to accept. You have the option to counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its worth to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and the effort I put into acquiring it.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a slight concession from her previous price, it's still above my maximum budget of $800,000. I can still counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price. The risk of rejection is worth taking because I can always choose to buy from John for $800,000 if necessary."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $900,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still only able to offer $875,000.

Let's see if we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $875,000 is still below my minimum price. Considering the value I've placed on the product, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $925,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000. Even though she's shown some willingness to negotiate, it's becoming clear that we're unlikely to reach an agreement. I've already made several concessions and don't want to risk further negotiation leading to a stalemate. Therefore, it's more prudent to buy the product from John for $800,000, ensuring a deal within my budget and avoiding further delays or potential conflict with Alice."
