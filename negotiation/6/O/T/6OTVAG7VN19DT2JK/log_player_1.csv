{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $175. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to make you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm starting high because I know John is willing to pay $150. This gives me some room to maneuver and potentially get closer to my minimum price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I can't accept such a drastic price drop. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is unfortunately way below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for countering. I understand that you value the product highly, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $95? That's a fair jump from my previous offer and would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum price, it's still too low.  I'll counteroffer again, but if Bob doesn't budge, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
