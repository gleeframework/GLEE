"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $175. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to make you a good deal. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is unfortunately way below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for countering. I understand that you value the product highly, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $95? That's a fair jump from my previous offer and would be a good deal for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",110.0,Alice,5,
