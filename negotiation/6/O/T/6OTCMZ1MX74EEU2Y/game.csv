"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think $2,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,600,000 is significantly below my valuation for this product. I've done my research, and its unique features and potential warrant a higher price.  How about we meet halfway at $1,925,000? This reflects both of our interests.",1925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has unique features, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,700,000? This is a more reasonable price for me.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $1,700,000 is still under my initial assessment, I'm willing to be flexible to close this deal. Would you consider $1,812,500?  That's a significant compromise on my end, demonstrating my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget with $1,812,500. I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my means.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
