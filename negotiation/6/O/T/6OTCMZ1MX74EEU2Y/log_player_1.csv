Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think $2,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
