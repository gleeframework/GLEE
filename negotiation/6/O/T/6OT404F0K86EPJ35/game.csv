"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $980,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on a price that works for both of us.",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but  $980,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,015,000? This would be a win-win situation, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable asset. What do you think?",1015000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,015,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $990,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $990,000.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is the absolute lowest I can go.  This is a fair price for the value this product will bring you, and it's a great opportunity. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
