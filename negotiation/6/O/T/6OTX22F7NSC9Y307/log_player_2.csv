"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. While I can't disclose all the details without a confidentiality agreement, I can assure you it's worth at least $1500000 to me. I'm offering it to you for $1750000, which represents a significant opportunity for you. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer. Since I don't know the value of the product to Alice, I have no idea if I'm getting a good deal or not. I know that I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is a much lower price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and consider buying the product from John.
