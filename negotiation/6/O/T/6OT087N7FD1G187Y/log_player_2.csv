"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($1,200,000) and the product's value to her ($1,500,000).  There's plenty of room for negotiation. It makes sense to counter-offer and see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is substantially lower than Alice's initial offer. While it might seem aggressive, it establishes a starting point that is beneficial to you. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** There's a significant gap between your counter-offer and both your budget and Alice's likely minimum acceptable price. This gap allows for back-and-forth negotiation.
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:** This low offer will help you gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. Her response will provide valuable information for your next move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,700,000 is still considerably higher than your budget. It seems like there's some negotiating space, but her counter-offer wasn't a very significant drop. It's worth making another counter-offer closer to your target, while also being prepared to walk away and potentially buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Seriousness:** This counter-offer shows Alice that you're willing to move closer to her price range but are still looking for a fair deal.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $1,350,000 is a strong position. It's:
    *  Significantly below Alice's current offer.
    *  Above the midpoint between your initial offer and her current offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
    *  Still within a range where you can make a profit if needed.
* **Maintaining Walk-Away Option:**  While this offer is getting closer to your limit, it's important to keep John's offer in mind. You still have that option if Alice isn't willing to budge further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's make this our final offer - $1,500,000. This reflects the product's true worth and I believe it's a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is at her limit:** Alice has explicitly stated this is her final offer. It's unlikely she'll go any lower than $1,500,000, which is her product's value to her.
* **Over Budget:** $1,500,000 is still $300,000 over your maximum budget. Accepting this offer would mean overspending significantly.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000.  This option keeps you within budget. 

While you could try another counter-offer, the risk of Alice refusing and leaving you with no deal is high. It's strategically better to secure the product at a price you know works for you."
