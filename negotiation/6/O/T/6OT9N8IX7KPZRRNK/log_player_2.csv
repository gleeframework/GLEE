"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always a good idea to see if you can get a better price, especially since you have 10 rounds to negotiate.  $65 is a good starting point, but there's room to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $50. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing I'm serious about getting a good deal. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and I'm hoping Alice will be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$60 is still a bit high, especially since Alice rejected my counteroffer. I'm going to keep trying to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 55}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $55. It's a compromise from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still trying to get a good deal.  I believe this is a fair offer, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $62. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $62
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice keeps coming back with offers higher than what I want to pay.  I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a lower price, but I'm getting closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 58}
```

I'm increasing my offer again to $58. This is getting close to my limit, but I'm still hoping to save a little more. If Alice doesn't accept this, I might need to start considering John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $63. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $63
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is clearly not going to budge. I've made multiple counteroffers, and she's consistently coming back with prices higher than my target.  I've got 3 rounds left, and I don't think there's time to get the price down further. To avoid the risk of running out of time, I'm going to buy the product from John."
