"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,625,000. This reflects the product's unique value while acknowledging your interest.",1625000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,625,000 is still beyond what I can reasonably spend. Let's try $1,250,000. This reflects a significant concession from my previous offer and demonstrates my sincere interest in this product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  It seems we both see the value in this product. How about we split the difference and land at $1,437,500?  That feels like a fair compromise.",1437500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a significant jump for me, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to acquiring this product.  I'm confident we can reach a final agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's close this out - how about $1,375,000? It's a strong offer, and it allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",1375000.0,Alice,7,
