Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it will be a highly worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price.
* **Room for negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate. If he rejects the first offer, you can always lower the price, knowing your minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000."
