"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. It's worth a lot to someone like you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  While $120 is more than the product's worth to Alice ($80), it's still cheaper than buying from John ($150). 
* **You want to save money:** Your goal is to get the product at the lowest price, and Alice's offer allows you to do that."
