"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  This product would be worth $6,000 to me. Would you consider a price in that range?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for.  This product offers a lot of value, and I believe a price closer to $15,000 is more reflective of that. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this product offers value, but $15,000 is still too high for my budget. I could potentially go up to $7,000 if that would be acceptable to you?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations here.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle.  How about $13,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $13,000 is still a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",10000.0,Bob,6,
