Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  This product would be worth $6,000 to me. Would you consider a price in that range?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for.  This product offers a lot of value, and I believe a price closer to $15,000 is more reflective of that. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations here.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle.  How about $13,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 13000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $13,000 is still a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.
