"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows you to make a significant profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still within the range of Bob's budget. It shows Bob is serious about negotiating and willing to push for a better deal. 
* **Justification:**  Bob provides a reason for his counteroffer by highlighting his budget and the value of the product. This makes the counteroffer more persuasive. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message ends with a question, inviting Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This still gives you a healthy profit margin, and it's a fair price for the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's counteroffer is closer to his desired price, it's still higher than he wants to pay. Rejecting this offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiation. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is making a small increase from his previous offer, showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway. This makes his counteroffer more appealing and indicates he's committed to reaching an agreement.
* **Justification:** He again justifies his offer with the value of the product and the progress of their negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message ends on a positive note, suggesting a desire to close the deal. This encourages Alice to consider his offer."
