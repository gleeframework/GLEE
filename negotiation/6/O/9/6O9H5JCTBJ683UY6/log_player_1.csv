Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a discounted price of $14,000. I believe this product would be very valuable to you, even at this price."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting with a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price ($14,000) leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also creates a sense of urgency and value. 
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** We don't know Bob's absolute maximum willingness to pay. He might be willing to go higher than $8,000, especially if he sees the value proposition.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't have an immediate need to sell the product and are comfortable with a small risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
