Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $12,000 is quite low for what I'm offering. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we try $11,500? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable price, his increments are too small and it's likely he'll continue to lowball. John's guaranteed offer ensures I don't lose out on the minimum value I place on the product."
