Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 170}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you can afford to start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80).  
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Offering a price of $170 allows room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Maximize potential profit:** If Bob accepts the $170 offer, you make a significant profit. If he rejects it, you can still sell to John at your minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to get you the highest possible price while still giving you the security of a guaranteed sale."
