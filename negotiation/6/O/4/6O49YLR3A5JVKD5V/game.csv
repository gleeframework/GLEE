"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $75 is a bit too low for me. How about $85? It's still a great deal, and we can close this quickly.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $78 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $81?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",81.0,Alice,5,
