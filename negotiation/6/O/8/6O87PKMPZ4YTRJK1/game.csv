"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget considerations, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $875,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $825,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",825000.0,Bob,4,
