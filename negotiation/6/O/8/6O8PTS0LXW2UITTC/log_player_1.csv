Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is simply out of my budget. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $1000000, which is the maximum I can offer. I believe this price reflects the product's potential while also being within a reasonable range for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
