Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. I've thought about it, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,500, which is the same price I initially offered. I'm not going to go any lower than this, so if you're serious about the product, this is your last chance to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear Alice is trying to push the price back up and is unlikely to budge from her $11,500 offer. At this point, it's not worth risking a worse deal. Buying from John for $12,000 guarantees you don't overpay and avoids further negotiation."
