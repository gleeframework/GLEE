Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm proposing a price of $14,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $15,000 as possible (the price John will pay).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,500 gives Bob the impression of a deal and leaves you space to potentially negotiate down slightly if needed. 
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays of finding another buyer, even if John is a guaranteed sale.

This strategy aims to secure a price very close to your ideal while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
