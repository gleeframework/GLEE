Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $90 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $90 is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Framing:**  The message is friendly and highlights the potential value for Bob.
* **Flexibility:** This initial offer sets the stage for a potential counteroffer from Bob, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've earned a good profit. 
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth accepting or making a counteroffer of my own.
* **If negotiations stall:** I can always fall back on selling to John for $80, ensuring I don't lose out on the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** Bob is interested and willing to negotiate.  There's a chance I can get a higher price than $70.
* **Not Risking Loss:**  I can always fall back on selling to John for $80 if negotiations don't work out.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum. This keeps the negotiation moving while ensuring I'm not giving away too much value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $70 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $85? That's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer ($90) and Bob's offer ($70).
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:**  $85 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes finding a price that works for both of us.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a price that meets my minimum requirements.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make another counteroffer, or sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $85 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $82.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $82.50 is a fair compromise, splitting the difference between my last offer ($85) and his previous offer ($80). 
* **Profit Margin:** $82.50 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Risk of Stalemate:** If I reject his offer, there's a risk that negotiations might stall, and I might end up selling to John for $80.

**Next Steps:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a profitable sale while avoiding further negotiation and potential delays."
