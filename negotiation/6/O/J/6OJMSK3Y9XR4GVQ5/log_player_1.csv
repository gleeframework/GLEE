``` 
 
This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my value of $12,000, but I'm willing to negotiate. This price is also higher than Bob's perceived value, so it gives him room to counteroffer if he's interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would be a good deal for me.  Let me know what you think.

$9,000 is closer to my desired price, but I'm still not satisfied.  I'm willing to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
