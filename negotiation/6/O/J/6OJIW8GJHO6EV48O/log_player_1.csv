"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it could be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $22,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above my minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm focusing on the product's value and potential benefits for Bob to create a positive perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, I signal my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $10,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation.  Bob starting at his perceived value was expected. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum while still leaving some room for bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is considerably higher. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Above Minimum:** I significantly lowered my initial price to show flexibility and meet Bob closer to his range. However, the new offer remains well above my absolute minimum and provides room for further negotiation. 
* **Seeking Agreement:** I'm framing the offer as a compromise and directly asking for Bob's opinion to encourage a collaborative negotiation. 
* **Time Consideration:**  While I have rounds remaining, I want to steer towards a favorable agreement sooner rather than later in case Bob is unwilling to budge much beyond his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $15,000 for the product. I hope this might be closer to what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meets My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $15,000 matches my absolute minimum acceptable price. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting this offer guarantees the sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation. 
* **John's Offer Is Equal:** While I could sell to John for the same price, continuing negotiations with Bob introduces a risk that he might withdraw or we fail to reach a deal within the remaining rounds. It's better to secure the sale now."
