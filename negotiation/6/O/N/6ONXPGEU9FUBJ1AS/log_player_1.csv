"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $120, he might be willing to pay a bit more, especially if he really wants it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $110 is significantly below my minimum value of $150. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $140, which is still above my minimum value of $150 but shows flexibility.  I believe this price is fair considering Bob's initial offer and the remaining rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is close to my minimum value of $150, and we're already in round 4. Accepting this offer secures a decent profit and avoids risking further negotiation. While John offers a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by rejecting Bob's offer."
