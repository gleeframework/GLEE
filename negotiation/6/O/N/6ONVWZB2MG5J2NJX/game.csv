"Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a truly unique and valuable asset. I believe its potential worth is significant, and I'm willing to part with it for $1500000.  This is a substantial investment opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value of this asset.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that recognizes both your budget and the product's potential.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1250000 is closer to my budget, I'm still a bit above my limit.  I'm prepared to offer $1100000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1100000 is still a bit below what I feel is a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it for $1175000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects both our interests. ",1175000.0,Alice,5,
