Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than $14000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. I can offer it to you for $17000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $17,000 is still above your budget. You have already made several counteroffers and Alice is not showing signs of significantly lowering the price.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John.  You can get the product for $15,000, saving you time and frustration."
