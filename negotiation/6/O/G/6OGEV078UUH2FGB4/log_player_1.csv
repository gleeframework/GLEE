"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $11,000 is too low, and I still have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $12,500?  This still gives you a significant value for the product, and it's closer to what I need to get."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $12,000. How about $11,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer, $11,750 is still too far below my minimum price. I have a few rounds left and can still negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I understand you want to stay under $12,000, but $11,750 is just a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  It's a fair compromise and will allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
