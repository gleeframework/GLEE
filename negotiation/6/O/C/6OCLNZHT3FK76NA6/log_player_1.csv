"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $180 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value. I believe this is a fair compromise, and Bob might be willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $185. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $185
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $185 is very close to my desired price and is a good deal considering the limited rounds. It's better than my minimum and potentially better than what John would offer, so accepting this deal is the best course of action."
