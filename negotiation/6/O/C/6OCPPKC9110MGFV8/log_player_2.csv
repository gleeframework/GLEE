"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
Let's try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first, as there is room for negotiation before reaching John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation before reaching my maximum budget or John's offer.  This approach aims to test Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a very favorable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your position, the product's value is significantly higher than that.  Could you consider $1,075,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down in price, but we're getting close to John's price. We'll try one more counter-offer before accepting John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I could go up to $950,000.  That's a firm offer."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

This counter-offer puts us close to the middle ground between our previous offer and Alice's current price. By stating it's a firm offer, it signals to Alice that this is our final offer and she should accept it or risk losing the sale."
