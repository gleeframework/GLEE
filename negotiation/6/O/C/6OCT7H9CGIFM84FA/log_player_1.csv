"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product!  I'm open to offers, but I know it's worth at least $150 to me. What do you think? "", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Open to Offers:** I'm signaling flexibility by saying I'm open to offers, which encourages Bob to counter.
* **Value Statement:** Mentioning the product's worth to me ($150) subtly reminds Bob of its value, and helps justify the starting price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob's willingness to negotiate shows there's potential to reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Selling to John is an option:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me leverage in negotiations.  I'll see if I can get closer to that price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $140? That's still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Fairness:** Emphasizing ""good deal for both of us"" helps frame the offer as mutually beneficial.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $140 is still higher than Bob's last offer, suggesting further negotiation is possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $140 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation continues:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, so there's still potential to reach a better price.
* **John's offer is a backup:** I can still sell to John for $150, giving me leverage to push for a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. $130 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go down to $135 for this product.  This is a fair price considering its value, and it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility while still remaining above my minimum.
* **Finality:**  Using ""let's close this deal"" adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept. 
* **Value Justification:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price, making it seem more reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $135 is a good price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $125 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Limited rounds remaining:** We are in Round 6, and I only have 4 rounds left to close a deal with Bob.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob that might result in a lower price.

It's more advantageous to accept John's offer than to continue negotiating with Bob, as there's a high chance we won't reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
