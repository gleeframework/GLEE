"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to sell you this great product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $90. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend $90, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. I think you'll really get a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is closer to Bob's target, he's still better off trying to negotiate further.  It's possible Alice will come down a bit more, and he doesn't want to miss that opportunity."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still hoping to get closer to $95.  How about we split the difference and I pay $97.50?"", ""product_price"": 97.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm not willing to go all the way to $97.50, but I'm willing to meet you at $107.50. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob ideally wants to pay closer to $95,  $107.50 is still a better deal than buying from John for $120.  There's a risk that Alice will increase her price in future rounds, so it's best to lock in this price now."
