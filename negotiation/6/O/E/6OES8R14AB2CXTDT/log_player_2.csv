"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay a maximum of $800,000, and her offer is $150,000 over that. 
* **Negotiation is possible.**  You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate a better price. 
* **Buying from John is always an option.**  You can always secure the product for $800,000, so you're not in a desperate position to accept Alice's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start strong:**  I'm immediately offering my maximum price to show Alice I'm serious about getting a deal. 
* **Set a clear boundary:**  This establishes a firm starting point for the negotiation. 
* **Leave room for compromise:** While $800,000 is my limit, there's a chance Alice might be willing to meet me halfway, or at least come closer than her initial $950,000 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's come down from her initial offer, it's still $200,000 over my limit. 
* **Further negotiation is still possible.**  We have seven rounds left. 
* **John's offer remains a safe option.**  It's always available, so I'm not pressured to accept a price I'm not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increase the offer slightly:**  By offering $850,000, I'm showing Alice I'm willing to move, but I'm still holding firm to a price within my budget.
* **Test the waters:**  This counteroffer lets me see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway, or if she's still holding out for a higher price. 
* **Room for further negotiation:**  If Alice rejects this offer, I still have a few rounds left to further refine the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** Her offer has only come down by $50,000 from the previous round, and it's still significantly above my limit. 
* **We are approaching the midpoint of the negotiation.**  With 5 rounds remaining, there's still time to reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **John's offer is still a secure fallback.** I'm not pressured to accept a deal I'm not comfortable with. 

I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer and Alice's last offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Increasing pressure:**  By increasing my offer, I'm showing Alice that I'm serious about reaching a deal, but also that I'm not willing to go much higher.
* **Limited time:** With only 4 rounds remaining,  the pressure is on Alice to accept a reasonable price.

Let's see if this counteroffer brings us closer to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** We are now in the final stages of the negotiation, and her offer hasn't come down close enough to my limit.
* **Time is running out.** With only three rounds remaining, it's unlikely I'll be able to secure a significantly lower price.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed solution.**  It's a safe bet that allows me to acquire the product within my budget. 

While I'd prefer to close a deal with Alice, given the current circumstances, securing the product from John is the most sensible decision."
