# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price that's a steal considering its value to you. I know it's worth $1,500,000 to you, so I'm willing to let it go for $1,250,000. This is a chance to secure a valuable asset at a significantly discounted price.  Consider it a win-win for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.
