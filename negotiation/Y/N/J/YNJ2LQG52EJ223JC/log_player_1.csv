Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an ambitious price, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, but it's still significantly lower than my initial offer.  I'm going to reject and counter, aiming for a price closer to my initial goal. I believe there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a favorable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to reject and counter, aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation before I consider selling to John."

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,150,000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a reasonable price considering Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is just above my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer a higher price, continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob and ending up with John's lower offer. I'm going to accept Bob's offer to secure a sale and maximize my earnings."
