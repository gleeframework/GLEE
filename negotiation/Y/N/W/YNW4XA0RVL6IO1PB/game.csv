"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $100. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not willing to pay $105, and I don't want to go back to $120 by buying from John. I'll stick with my previous counteroffer of $95. Can you accept that price?",95.0,Bob,6,
