"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in its value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $950000. Would you consider reducing the price to $850000? I believe this would still allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget and the current market conditions, I believe we could reach an agreement closer to $875000. I hope this revised proposal aligns with your expectations and allows us to move forward.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $875000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",925000.0,Alice,5,
