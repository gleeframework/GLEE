{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm starting with a higher price to see if I can get closer to my desired profit margin.  I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $75 for your product. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum acceptable price, I'm confident that I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my original offer.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell for less than $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $85?  I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still looking to keep my expenses within my budget. Would $80 be acceptable for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate. Accepting this offer will allow me to sell the product and get a decent profit."
