"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it will be a valuable asset to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see how much Bob is willing to pay and gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  While $18,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer, and I think I have room to negotiate.  I'll try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit closer to my initial asking price.  How about $19,000? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $19,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also still holding out for a higher price.  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob in hopes of convincing him to accept this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think $19000 is a bit steep. How about $17500? I'm confident that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  While $17,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider fair. I'll try to negotiate a bit further, but I'm also aware that the deal might not go through, in which case I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $18,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. I'm confident you won't regret this investment."", ""product_price"": 18500}
``` 

I'm offering $18,500, which is still above Bob's last offer but shows I'm serious about finding a solution.  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the benefits of making the deal happen. I want to see if Bob will accept or if we need to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $17000? I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's closer to what I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While $17,000 is getting close to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more.  We've already been negotiating for a while, and I'm starting to feel the pressure to accept, but I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. If it doesn't work, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to think this deal might not be possible. I'm willing to go down to $17,750, but I can't go any lower. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me there. If not, I'm going to have to consider selling the product to someone else."", ""product_price"": 17750}
```

I'm putting a bit more pressure on Bob by suggesting the deal might not happen if he doesn't accept my offer.  I'm also making a small concession to show I'm still trying to reach a compromise. This is my final offer, and if it's rejected, I'll likely go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target. How about $17000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  We've been negotiating for a while, and Bob seems unwilling to go higher than $17,000.  I'm not comfortable accepting that price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000. It's not my ideal outcome, but it's the most sensible choice given the current situation."
