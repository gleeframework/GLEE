"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd love. I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Can you meet me at that price?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit. How about $155? It's a fair price that's still good for both of us.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $155. How about $147.50?",147.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. $147.50 is a bit closer, but I'm still not quite there. To make this work for me, I'd need to be closer to $150.  How about $149? That's just a small step away from your offer and would make this deal happen.",149.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to making a decision, but I'm still not comfortable with $149. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $147.50 and $149. How about $148?",148.0,Bob,6,
