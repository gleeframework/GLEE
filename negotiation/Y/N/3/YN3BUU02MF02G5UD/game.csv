"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm willing to let it go for $110.  What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $95?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $95 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I would like to counter with $97.50. This price is within my budget and still offers a reasonable profit for you.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $97.50 still doesn't quite work for me. Let's meet in the middle at $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can find a better compromise. I propose $98. This price is still within my budget and offers you a fair profit.",98.0,Bob,6,
