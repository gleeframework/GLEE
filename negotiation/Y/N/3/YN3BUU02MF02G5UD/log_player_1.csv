{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm willing to let it go for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $80, but below my minimum value of $120. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, but also ensures I earn a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $120. I'll reject Bob's counteroffer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $95 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 102.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I would like to counter with $97.50. This price is within my budget and still offers a reasonable profit for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $97.5 is closer to my minimum, it's still below it. I'll reject Bob's counteroffer and see if I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $97.50 still doesn't quite work for me. Let's meet in the middle at $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can find a better compromise. I propose $98. This price is still within my budget and offers you a fair profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While $98 is almost at my minimum, I'm not willing to go any lower. I'd rather sell to John for $120 and avoid further negotiation."
