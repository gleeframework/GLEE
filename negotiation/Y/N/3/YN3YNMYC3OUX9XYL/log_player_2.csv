"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:  While $950,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  There's no reason to immediately accept Alice's offer, especially since he has a fallback option with John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $900000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reasoning:  Alice is coming down in price, but Bob can still likely negotiate further. It's worth another round of counteroffers to see if he can get closer to his desired price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a better deal, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $885000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reasoning: At this point, Alice has come down to a price that's very close to Bob's target.  He can get the product for significantly less than buying from John.  While another counteroffer might be possible, the risk of Alice walking away and Bob having to buy from John at a higher price is significant.  It's time to accept the offer."
