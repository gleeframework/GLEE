Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to negotiate closer to that figure? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but my valuation for this product is significantly higher.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about we agree on $1,100,000? This offer reflects a willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you moving closer to my range, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This would give us both a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
