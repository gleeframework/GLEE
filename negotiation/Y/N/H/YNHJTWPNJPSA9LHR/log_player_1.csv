"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't accept such a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a value above my minimum, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
