"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm still a bit above your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget. Let me know if this works for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your desire to stay close to $1,000,000, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000.
