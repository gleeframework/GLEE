"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is seriously interested and has a high perceived value for the product.  It also leaves room for negotiation if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, it's still below what I want to achieve. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm countering with $9,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will show I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product higher than Bob currently does."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee I'll get more, and I risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting his offer is the best option at this point."
