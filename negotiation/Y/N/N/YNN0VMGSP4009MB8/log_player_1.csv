Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we meet somewhere in between these two prices? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob.  $8,000 is too low, but I might be able to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,000 just doesn't work for me. How about $8,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of your product, I still believe $8,000 is a fair price. Could we possibly meet at this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $8,000 is still too low. I'm willing to go down to $8,250. That's a good compromise, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I appreciate your offer, but I would like to stick to my original price of $8,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting late in the negotiation, and Bob isn't budging on his price. I've already dropped my price significantly, and I don't want to risk ending up with a price that's too low for me.  It's better to sell to John and get the full $10,000."
