{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts with a high price, acknowledging that you don't know Bob's value for the product. It also encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation, leaving room for him to counteroffer. It is important to note that this is just the initial offer, and you will need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum value. While he shows interest, it's not worth selling at this price. Rejecting allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, considering your enthusiasm.  Let me know if that's a number we can work with."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still very interested in the product, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below your minimum value of $12,000, but it's closer than before. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $9000 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Would that be something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to your minimum value, it's still not worth risking further negotiation. The negotiation process has taken multiple rounds, and Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees you the minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
