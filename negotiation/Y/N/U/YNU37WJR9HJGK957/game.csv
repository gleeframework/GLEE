"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $12,000 for the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at that price. I'm willing to consider a compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale. My next offer is $11,500 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the fact that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not sure $10,250 is quite enough for me to make it worth my while. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My next offer is $11,750 for the product. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",11750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come up a bit, how about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $10,500, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My next offer is $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can finally meet in the middle.",12000.0,Alice,7,
