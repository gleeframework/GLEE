It's clear Alice is very slowly coming down from her initial offer, and we're getting close to the point where further negotiation is unlikely to get us significantly closer to John's price.  Since we have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, it's strategically better to secure that price rather than risk Alice not going any lower."
