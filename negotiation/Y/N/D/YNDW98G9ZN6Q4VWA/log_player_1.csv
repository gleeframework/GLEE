Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product that I know you're interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. This is a limited-time offer, so don't miss out!"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she needs to offer Bob an incentive to buy. 
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so Alice needs to offer it for less than that to make it appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer is a strong starting point, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, allowing Alice to potentially earn even closer to her desired amount.

By starting at $11,500, Alice is aiming for a significant profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
