{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It allows for some room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob.  By offering a price that is closer to my minimum value, I can potentially close the deal sooner, minimizing the risk of Bob walking away. However, I am still open to counteroffers and further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not meeting my expectations. I am going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'm aiming to get as close to my $1,500,000 value as possible, without risking losing Bob completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I need to stay closer to my initial price point. How about we settle on $1,250,000? This is a significant discount from my original offer and still allows you to get a valuable product at a great price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still looking to keep the price within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $1,225,000 for the product? I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject it and try to close the gap a little more with a counteroffer. I'm hoping to get closer to my $1,500,000 goal without pushing Bob away completely."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a compromise. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,235,000.  This price reflects the value of the product for you, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. Let's finalize this deal and make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 1235000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my financial constraints, could we possibly agree on $1,230,000 for the product? I believe this price strikes a good balance between the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,230,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiation has gone on for a few rounds, and while Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. At this point, the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially resulting in a lower final price outweighs the potential benefits.  I'm going to take the sure thing and sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
