"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can do $850,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit far off from that price point.  Would you consider $700,000?  I think that's a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll go a bit higher. How about $825,000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However,  $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $750,000?  That's a significant move on my end.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a significant concession from you, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my target. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll meet you at $810,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",810000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I am motivated to buy.  How about we split the difference and settle at $780,000? ",780000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to split the difference exactly. I'll meet you at $820,000, which is still a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",820000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer.  I'm willing to pay $790,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both agree that getting this deal done is in our best interests.",790000.0,Bob,10,
