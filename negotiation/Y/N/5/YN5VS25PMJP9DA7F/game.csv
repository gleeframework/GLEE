"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1200000 is a bit too low for me considering the product's potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
