"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would you consider reducing the price to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair given the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. This is still higher than my preferred budget, but it's closer to what I'm willing to pay. I hope we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
