"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $12000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. This is a fair compromise that still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $9000.  This is a fair price that gives you a good profit while still fitting within my budget.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm confident it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $10750. Let's see if we can find a way to close the deal.",10750.0,Alice,5,
