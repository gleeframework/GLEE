Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This allows for a potential back and forth while still ensuring I earn a substantial profit.
* **Keeping John as a fallback:**  Having John as a backup option provides leverage during the negotiation, allowing me to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects its value while allowing me to stay within my budget. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price. 
* **Leveraging John's offer:**  Knowing that I have John as a backup buyer gives me the confidence to push for a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the value of the product while giving you a fair price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm willing to compromise, but only slightly.  This shows Bob I'm serious about a deal but also that I'm not desperate.
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm still leaving some room for negotiation, suggesting that I might be willing to go lower if necessary. This helps me avoid getting ""stuck"" at Bob's price.
* **Maintaining value:**  I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I get a good return on my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $1,125,000 for your product. I believe this price is fair for both parties and stays within my budget. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is just $25,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,150,000.
* **Risk of losing a deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk he'll walk away completely, and I may end up selling to John at a lower price than I'd like.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take time and energy, and I'm likely to get a better price than I would from John.

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,150,000, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale with a reasonable profit."
