"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  It's the absolute maximum I can do.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $9,000, but I'm not willing to accept that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $9,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise considering its value to you.",9800.0,Alice,5,
