"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a rare opportunity to own this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,800,000."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting with a high number, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and make your eventual target price seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Concessions:** Offering a price of $1,800,000 allows for significant concessions in subsequent rounds while still aiming for a final price above your minimum. 

**Important Note:** I'm aware that I can sell the product to John for $1,000,000. However, in the first few rounds, I'm primarily focused on maximizing profit with Bob, as there's a good chance of exceeding John's offer. I will carefully evaluate Bob's responses and consider John's offer if negotiations don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is a significant step closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll counter with a price closer to my target, aiming to secure a higher profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,500,000 is still lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer signals a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position. By suggesting a price halfway between our previous positions, I'm aiming for a compromise that feels fair to both parties. 
* **Maintaining a Profit Margin:** $1,650,000 is still a significant profit over John's offer, and it allows for some potential concessions in later rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I still believe I have leverage. We are only in round 4 out of 10, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll make another counteroffer, but I'll be cautious about going too low too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is a significant drop from my previous offer. Let's find a middle ground.  Would you consider $1,550,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Down Concessions:**  I'm reducing the size of my concessions to signal that I'm getting closer to my limit. 
* **Finding a Balance:**  The price of $1,550,000 maintains a reasonable profit margin while still showing Bob that I am willing to negotiate.
* **Time Consideration:** We are approaching the halfway point in the negotiation rounds.  I want to apply a bit more pressure while I still have the option to work with John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the negotiation is getting tougher, I'm not ready to settle just yet.  Here's why:

* **Profit Margin:**  $1,350,000 is a significant profit, but I still believe I can get closer to $1,500,000.
* **Rounds Remaining:** We still have 4 rounds left, giving us time for a few more counteroffers. Bob's consistent engagement suggests he's still interested, so I'll apply a bit more pressure.

I'll make one more counteroffer that is closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum. If he rejects this, I'll seriously consider accepting his next offer, or walking away to John's deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're nearing a deal here. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,475,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber, and I'm confident you won't regret this investment.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1475000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession ($75,000) to signal that I'm reaching my lower limit. This keeps the price above $1,400,000 but shows flexibility.
* **Urgency and Value Emphasis:** I'm creating a sense of urgency while reminding Bob of the product's value. This might encourage him to accept before the price potentially goes up again (if I decide to take a harder line in later rounds).
* **Preparation for Future Rounds:** This offer sets the stage for the remaining rounds.  If Bob rejects it, I'll be ready to either accept his counteroffer (if it's reasonable) or seriously consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to get as close to my target as possible. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has dropped significantly, and it's now below my acceptable profit margin. Here's why I'm choosing to sell to John:

* **Profit Protection:** While $1,250,000 is still a profit, accepting such a low offer sets a bad precedent and might lead Bob to believe I'm desperate to close the deal.  John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 protects my minimum acceptable profit.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him further lowering his offer or the negotiation reaching a stalemate. Accepting John's offer provides a guaranteed sale and allows me to move on to other opportunities.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only two rounds left, Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer, especially after seeing my willingness to negotiate down to $1,475,000.

It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
