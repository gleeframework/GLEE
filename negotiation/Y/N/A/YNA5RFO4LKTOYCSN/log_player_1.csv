Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $18,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By starting at $18,000, I can gauge Bob's level of interest. If he accepts immediately, I've maximized my profit. If he counteroffers, I know he's serious but wants to negotiate.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm secure knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 if Bob rejects the offer. This knowledge allows me to be more confident in my initial high offer."
