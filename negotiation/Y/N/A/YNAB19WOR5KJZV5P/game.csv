"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but this product is truly exceptional. It's worth more than just the price tag. I'm willing to come down to $10,250, which is a significant concession.  This reflects the value you'll get, and it also shows my commitment to making this deal work. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's make this happen.",10250.0,Alice,5,
