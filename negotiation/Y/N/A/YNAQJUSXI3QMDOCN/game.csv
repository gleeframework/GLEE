"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product has potential, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand we're close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'll offer you a compromise: $825,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
