Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value but lower than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great price"" to entice Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm not being aggressive, I'm inviting Bob to discuss. 

This approach allows me to maximize my earnings while also keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  While I want to sell the product,  accepting his offer would be a significant loss for me. Rejecting his offer allows me to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is too low. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm not shutting the door completely.  I'm offering a counter-offer to show flexibility and keep the negotiation moving.
* **Compromise:** I'm suggesting a compromise price ($11,000) that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial proposal.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using phrases like ""fair price"" and ""compromise"" to keep the conversation positive. 

This approach aims to bridge the gap with Bob while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my desired price, but it's getting close to my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject his offer, there's a risk that he'll walk away from the deal altogether.  It's possible he'll be unwilling to negotiate further. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, selling to Bob at $10,500 is still a better outcome than selling to John at $15,000.  There's less profit, but I'm also saving time and energy on further negotiations.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice in this situation."
