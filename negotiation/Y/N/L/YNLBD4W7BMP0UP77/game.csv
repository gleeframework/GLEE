"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is significantly lower than the value I see in this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated for the potential it offers. Let's meet in the middle at $1500000.  This would still be a great deal for you and would allow me to make this transaction worthwhile. What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to agree on a price.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000, but this is really my final offer.

"Bob,  I'm starting to run out of time here, and it's becoming clear that we may not be able to reach an agreement.  To be upfront, my absolute minimum for this product is $1300000.
