"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. This allows me to explore if Bob is genuinely interested in the product at a price that's still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initially stated value of the product, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's important to remember that I can sell to John for $1,500,000 at any time. Therefore, I need to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price range before considering his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $1,200,000? This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to recoup some of the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to be more reasonable while still maintaining a significant profit.  My new offer is closer to Bob's offer, signaling my willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still too high.  I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows you to make a decent profit.  Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000. I have 6 more rounds to push Bob closer to my asking price, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. How about $1,150,000?  That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm offering a slight counter-compromise to Bob. It's a good middle ground between my last offer and his offer. I'm hoping that this small adjustment will be enough to convince Bob to accept. We are running out of rounds, but I'm still hopeful I can secure a better deal than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still slightly out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. I believe this offer reflects the value of the product for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe there's room for improvement. I have 4 more rounds to negotiate, and I'm determined to get as close to my target price as possible.  I'm confident that with a bit more persuasion, I can convince Bob to pay a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I understand your budget constraints.  How about $1,140,000? This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product for both of us. It's a win-win situation.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1140000}
```

I'm offering a small compromise, acknowledging Bob's budget while still staying close to my desired price.  I'm emphasizing the win-win aspect of the deal and expressing confidence in reaching an agreement. With only 3 rounds left, I'm pushing for a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,140,000 is still slightly higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $1,130,000. This is a fair price, and we're just a small step away from a deal. Let's find common ground and close this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,130,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,130,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $1,130,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering we're in the final rounds. It's also closer to my minimum acceptable price than selling to John for $1,500,000.  I've successfully negotiated a fair price, and I'm confident that this is the best outcome for me."
