Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500.  I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but still make the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than $15,000. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 gives us leverage. We're not desperate to sell to Bob below our minimum.

This strategy aims to find the sweet spot between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob."
