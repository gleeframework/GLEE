Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $15,000, but am open to discussing a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and might even surprise you. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  By saying you are ""open to discussing,"" you signal to Bob that you're willing to negotiate.
* **Highlight Value (but not desperation):**  Mentioning the product's benefit to Bob emphasizes its worth without revealing your guaranteed sale to John. 

**Important Note:** While John represents a safety net, the goal is to maximize profit. This offer aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob."
