"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my price point.  To be honest, my budget caps out at $1,000,000. If you're willing to make a deal at that price I'll take it, otherwise I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, I'm open to discussing further. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
