"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, I'm open to discussing further. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.

Alice is unwilling to meet my maximum budget. It's not worth continuing the negotiation as I have a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000."
