"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and it's not worth risking the extra $50,000. Buying from John guarantees the best price for me."
