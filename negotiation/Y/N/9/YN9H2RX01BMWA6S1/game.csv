"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $900,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $900,000 is higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm happy to offer $800,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's above your estimated value and significantly lower than my initial target.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value I believe the product is worth to me. I'm counteroffering at $920,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $920,000 is still a bit higher than I can justify.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to increase my offer to $850,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920,000 and $850,000, which would be $885,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I believe the product has, and I'm hoping we can agree on this.",885000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $885,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $870,000.  This is a very reasonable price, and I hope we can close the deal here. Let's finalize this and avoid going back and forth any longer.",870000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to finalize the deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $900,000. I'm willing to make one last concession, and I'll meet you at $880,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can agree on this.",880000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort, but $880,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $875,000 as my final offer. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",875000.0,Bob,10,
