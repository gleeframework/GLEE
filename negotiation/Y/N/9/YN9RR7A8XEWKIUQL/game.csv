"I appreciate the details about the product, but I'm on a budget. I'm willing to consider purchasing it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I believe that's a fair price considering the features and quality you mentioned.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest in our product. However, after careful consideration, I must respectfully decline the offer of $120. Our product's unique features and high-quality craftsmanship justify a price closer to the original offer of $200. I am open to discussing a compromise that respects both the value we place on our product and your budget. Would you be willing to consider an offer between $150 and $180?",165.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget with your new offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $150. Would you be willing to consider that price?",150.0,Bob,4,
