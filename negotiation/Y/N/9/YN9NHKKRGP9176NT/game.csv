"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? It's a fair offer considering its age and the current market.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $5,000 is a significant discount, but I'm afraid I can't accept it. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $9,000 is still a little steep for me.  How about $6,500? I'm serious about buying this product, and I think this offer demonstrates that.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $7,800. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. I'm eager to finalize the sale and move forward.",7800.0,Alice,5,
