"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $1,400,000. It's a significant investment with great potential, and I believe it will be a worthwhile addition to your assets. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's more than your maximum budget and more importantly, it's more than John's offer. You can save $200,000 by going with John."
