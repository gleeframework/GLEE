(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $1,200,000.  This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

Bob is starting with a low counteroffer, hoping to find a middle ground.  $850,000 is still significantly below Alice's asking price, but it's a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price.  There's still room to negotiate further, so rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it below $1 million.  This shows he's willing to negotiate, but is also trying to keep the price as low as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, there's still a considerable difference. There are still rounds left, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to keep pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing his willingness to compromise.  $1,000,000 is a significant jump from his previous offer, and it's closer to Alice's most recent offer. This could be a good point to reach a deal, but Bob still has room to negotiate if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, there are still a few rounds left. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if a better price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1020000}
```

Bob is increasing his offer once more, but only by a small amount. This demonstrates his willingness to negotiate, but also his desire to keep the price as low as possible.  He's aiming to reach a compromise close to the midpoint between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,140,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,140,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

With only one round remaining, there's a high chance that Bob won't be able to get the product for his desired price. Alice's offer is still higher than his target, and there's no guarantee she'll accept a counteroffer.  It's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John at his guaranteed price of $800,000."
