"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial price, it's still more than your maximum budget.  Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,500. This is a significant drop from Alice's offer and closer to my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to my budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I will continue to negotiate with Alice, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $8,750.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still emphasizes that I'm not willing to go beyond my maximum budget.  It's a compromise, but it still leaves room for Alice to come down a bit more if she's serious about selling."
