While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to drop my price significantly.  $9000 is a fair compromise, and I believe Bob will accept it."

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not enough for me. I'm willing to walk away and sell to John, as I'm confident I can get my desired price from him."
