Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is quite a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the product's value. While I'm confident in its potential to yield even greater returns, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,750,000?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,750,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he will reach my minimum. Selling to John guarantees I get my desired price without further negotiation."
