"Alice, your offer is quite a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the product's value. While I'm confident in its potential to yield even greater returns, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,750,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's true worth.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,750,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.  Let's meet in the middle.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
