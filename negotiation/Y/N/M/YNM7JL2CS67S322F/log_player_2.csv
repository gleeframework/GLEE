"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'd really be interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $115. This is a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** The product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $115.
* **John's Price:** John is selling the product for $120.

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob saves $5 compared to buying from John.  Even though Alice's offer is higher than her own valuation of the product ($100), it's still a better deal for Bob than buying from John."
