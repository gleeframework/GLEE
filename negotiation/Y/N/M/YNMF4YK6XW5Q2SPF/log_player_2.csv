"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than John's price of $120, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  There's room for negotiation, as the product is worth $80 to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  $100 is still a good price, as it's $20 less than John's offer.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject further counteroffers, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer secures a good deal and avoids potential delays."
