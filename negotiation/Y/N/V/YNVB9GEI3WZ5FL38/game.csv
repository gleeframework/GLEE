"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price of $1,050,000 reflects that more accurately.  Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still think $950,000 is a reasonable price. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go up to $1,050,000. How about we meet at $980,000?",980000.0,Bob,4,
