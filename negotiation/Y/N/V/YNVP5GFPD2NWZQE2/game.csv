"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you're excited about the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested, but I'm only able to pay $120 right now. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $160.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $140? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you at $155, which is still a good deal for both of us.",155.0,Alice,5,
