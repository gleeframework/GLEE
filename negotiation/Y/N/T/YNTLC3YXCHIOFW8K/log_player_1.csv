Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product is worth a significant amount to both of us. I'm offering it to you for $950,000.  I think this price reflects its value while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $950,000 is well above your $800,000 minimum, so you're already in a good position.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $950,000 is still less than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This gives you flexibility to adjust the price based on Bob's response.

Remember, you can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a price closer to $850,000.  I believe that's still a fair price for both of us, considering its value to you.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still above your minimum, it's significantly lower than your initial offer and leaves less room for potential profit. You should reject his offer and see if you can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000,  which is a significant concession on my part.  This price still allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:** $900,000 is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Highlight your willingness to negotiate:** This shows Bob that you're serious about selling to him but won't settle for a price too far below your desired value.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:** You can still adjust the price if Bob isn't satisfied with this counteroffer. 

Remember, you can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $875,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while saving me a significant amount. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $875,000 is a good deal. It's closer to your desired price than John's offer, and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go higher.  Accepting his offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a failed deal."
