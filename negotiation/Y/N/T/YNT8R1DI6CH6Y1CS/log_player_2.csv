# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's a great deal for you and I think you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $115, especially since you have a fallback option with John."

Alice's offer:

You're still $10 above your ideal price. Keep trying to negotiate with Alice. You're closer to your desired price point, and you have the option of buying from John as a safety net."
