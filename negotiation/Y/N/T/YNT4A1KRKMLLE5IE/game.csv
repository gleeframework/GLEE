"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point that works for me.  How about we settle at $750,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product while working within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to your target, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $750,000. I can offer you the product for $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",950000.0,Alice,5,
