"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $600,000?"", 
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone throughout the negotiation is important to foster a positive relationship and increase the chances of a successful outcome. 
* **Anchoring:** By offering $600,000, I'm attempting to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range. Even if Alice doesn't accept this offer outright, it shifts the focus away from her initial high price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  While $900,000 is closer to my target price, it's still above my $800,000 maximum. There's room for further negotiation.
* **Downward Trend:** Alice significantly lowered her initial price, indicating she's willing to negotiate. I want to see if I can push the price down further.
* **Backup Option:** I have the security of buying from John for $800,000 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't reach an acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point that works for me.  How about we settle at $750,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product while working within my budget."", 
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** This offer splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($900,000) and my previous offer ($600,000), showing a willingness to compromise while still moving closer to my target.
* **Justification:** I've provided a reason for my counteroffer (""reflects the value while working within my budget""), which can make it more persuasive. 
* **Approaching the Limit:**  I'm getting closer to my upper limit of $800,000. If Alice rejects this offer, I might need to consider accepting a price slightly above my target or going with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your target, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $750,000. I can offer you the product for $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice has increased her offer from $900,000 to $950,000, indicating she's unlikely to go much lower. 
* **Over Budget:**  Even with further negotiation, it's doubtful I can get the price down to my $800,000 limit.
* **Secure Alternative:** I have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for my target price. There's no need to risk overpaying at this point."
