"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $950000.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1100000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm happy to meet you halfway again.  I'll offer $1025000.  This price reflects the value I place on the product and would allow us both to walk away happy.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1025000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $1075000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
