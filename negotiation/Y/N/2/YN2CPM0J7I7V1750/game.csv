,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850,000, but I'm still a bit shy of that number. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $775,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is closer to your last offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement this round.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $825,000, but I'm still not sure that's the best value for me. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can we make a deal at this price?",800000.0,Bob,6,
