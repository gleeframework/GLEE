"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to start at $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,500. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, considering the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit steep.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $8,250 is still a bit below what I can accept. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,625? This would be a fair price for both of us.",8625.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very fair, and I appreciate that. $8,625 is close, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Would you be willing to do $8,400?  That's my final offer. ",8400.0,Bob,6,
