"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering its worth to me and the potential benefits it offers you.  Let me know your thoughts.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $8,500? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,750 is still too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.  How about $8,250? This is a significant drop from my original offer and still allows you to get a great deal on a product that's worth a lot to you.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the continued negotiation.  I appreciate you trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $7,900.  I believe this is a fair offer considering John is also offering me the product.",7900.0,Bob,6,
