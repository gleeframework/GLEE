Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $150 to me. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm aiming to get as close to $150 as possible, as that's the price John is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$120 is far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price to $140, which is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate. This is also a good middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $150, Bob's offer of $130 is only $20 below that. It's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely by continuing to negotiate."
