"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. This will give me a good starting point to see if Bob is interested in the product at a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $120. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm countering with $130, which is still above my minimum value of $120 but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still ensuring I get a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with another counteroffer. I have several rounds left and want to try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering $125, which is a further compromise and only $5 above my minimum acceptable price. This is a strong signal that I'm close to my lower limit, but still hoping for a better deal."
