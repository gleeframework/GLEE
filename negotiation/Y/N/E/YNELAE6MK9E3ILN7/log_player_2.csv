# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value to you, I propose a price of $12,000. This is a special offer considering its worth to you, and I believe it strikes a fair balance between our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. However, $12,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which still represents a good profit for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}

# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider a compromise. I would like to offer the product to you for $11,000. This proposal aims to be fair to both parties, taking into account the product's value to you and my need to achieve a satisfactory profit.
