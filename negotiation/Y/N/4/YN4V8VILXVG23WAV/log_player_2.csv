"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is higher than her minimum price ($1,000,000), so there's room for negotiation. There's no point in buying from John at this stage.  A counteroffer gives you a chance to get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the value this product brings is truly significant.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? I believe that's a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $1,350,000 to $1,225,000, which is getting closer to my desired price point. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product at a good price while saving money compared to buying from John."
