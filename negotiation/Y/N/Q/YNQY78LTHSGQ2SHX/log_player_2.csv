"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's always good to try and negotiate, especially when there's room for a better price.  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, we can aim for a lower price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I have to balance that with the value I'm willing to accept. Let me see what I can do. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,150,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

We're still in a good position to negotiate. Alice's offer is better, but we can likely get a better deal by continuing to counter."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to go up to $1,100,000, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000. It's a fair price, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is within our budget and a reasonable compromise. We've saved a significant amount compared to buying from John, and we're still getting a good deal considering the product's value to Alice."
