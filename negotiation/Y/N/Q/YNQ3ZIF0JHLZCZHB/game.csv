"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,600,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but  $1,600,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your initial offer.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $2,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000, which is a fair compromise given our positions.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
