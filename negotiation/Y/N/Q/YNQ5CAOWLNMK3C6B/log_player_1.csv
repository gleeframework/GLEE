Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I have leverage to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Starting with a significantly higher offer ($14,000) allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential price ceiling.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  If Bob rejects the initial offer, I can gradually lower the price during negotiation, knowing my fallback option with John.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while minimizing the risk of losing out on a sale altogether."
