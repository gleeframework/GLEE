Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Acknowledging Value:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing your absolute bottom line. 
* **Leaving Room:** Offering at $1,100,000 leaves space to negotiate down towards Bob's perceived value of $800,000 while staying well above your own minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Gap:** Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is still a substantial $150,000 away from your starting price and $250,000 away from your ""ideal"" price. 
* **Room to Negotiate:** There's a good chance you can negotiate Bob up further, especially since his offer acknowledges the product's value. 
* **John as Leverage:** You can use the guaranteed offer from John as leverage in your negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your perspective on the market. While I'm motivated to find a deal, that price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I could consider $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:**  The message starts by acknowledging Bob's offer and seeking common ground. 
* **Strategic Movement:**  Coming down $50,000 shows willingness to negotiate but holds firm above the $1,000,000 mark. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product might be worth more elsewhere (""true value"") without directly invoking John.
* **Questioning for Engagement:** Ending with a question encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $950,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,025,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Compromise:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's only $75,000 less than your last counteroffer and significantly closer to your initial asking price. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains, while risking Bob walking away.
* **Strong Profit:**  A sale at $1,025,000 still represents a substantial profit margin, even if it falls short of your ""ideal"" price. It's better to secure a good deal than risk losing it altogether."
