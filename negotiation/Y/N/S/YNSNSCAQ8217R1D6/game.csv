"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe the product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is considerably below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This reflects its value while still leaving you with a significant potential return.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $925,000?  This price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
