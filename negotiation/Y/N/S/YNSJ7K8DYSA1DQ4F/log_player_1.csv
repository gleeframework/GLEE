Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product. Considering its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,000,000. I'm confident that this investment will yield significant returns for you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and the potential returns. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches John's standing offer, it's important to remember your product's worth to you is at least $1,500,000. Continuing negotiations with Bob might yield a higher price, but there's no guarantee, and it introduces the risk of ending up with a lower offer or even no deal at all. 

John's offer represents the guaranteed maximum value for your product, and accepting it eliminates uncertainty and potential negotiation fatigue."
