"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I am interested in the product, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you a price of $9,000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget.  How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're getting closer to a number I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is the lowest I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and what you're willing to pay. Let's make a deal!",8000.0,Alice,5,
