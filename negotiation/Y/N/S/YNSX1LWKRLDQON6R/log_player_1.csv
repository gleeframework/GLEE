{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $80.
* **Maximize Profit:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation ($150) maximizes your potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $120 is a strong starting point, there's a chance Bob might negotiate down. This price gives you some wiggle room while still aiming for a significant profit."
