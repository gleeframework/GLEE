"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $12,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get a better price. $13,000 is closer to my minimum but I'm not desperate to sell yet. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm going down slightly from my initial offer, but still staying above Bob's counteroffer. I believe this demonstrates I'm open to negotiation while still trying to secure a decent price."
