{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I could continue negotiating, Bob is consistently moving upwards and we are getting close to the point where the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of him lowering his offer or me pushing him away. Accepting his offer of $1,400,000 guarantees a significant profit above my minimum."
