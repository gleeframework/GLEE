"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $1100000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1250000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you can live with.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $1200000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm not comfortable going above that.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
