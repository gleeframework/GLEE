"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your valuation.  I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.  This is my final offer.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product's value is high, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
