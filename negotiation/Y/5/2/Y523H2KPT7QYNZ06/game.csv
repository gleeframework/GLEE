"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This is a very competitive price for what you're getting.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, we're still quite far apart on price. To be frank, anything over $1,500,000 is pushing my budget. I could go up to $1,300,000 if that would get this deal done.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
