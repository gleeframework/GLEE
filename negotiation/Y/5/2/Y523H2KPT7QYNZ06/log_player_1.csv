Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, we're still quite far apart on price. To be frank, anything over $1,500,000 is pushing my budget. I could go up to $1,300,000 if that would get this deal done.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer.  I appreciate the movement.  How about we split the difference on our last two numbers - would you do it for $1,475,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000.

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, it's clear he's very focused on staying under $1,500,000.  At this point, the potential gains from continuing the negotiation with Bob are outweighed by the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
