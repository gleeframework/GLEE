"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $15,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $13,000. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get great value from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $12,000, which is lower than what John is offering.**  
* **This is a good deal for Bob**, saving him $3,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **There's no need to risk further negotiation** as Alice is already closer to Bob's desired price."
