"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $119 is close to your maximum budget, you can do better. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price in the next round. You can always buy from John for $120 if needed."
