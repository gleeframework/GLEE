Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $880,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and $880,000 is a solid profit. It's time to accept and close the deal."
