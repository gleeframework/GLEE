"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. How about $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a great deal for you, and still allows me to get a fair price for my product.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $90. This will allow us both to get a fair deal.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a good price here. Let's meet in the middle at $92.50.  This would give us both a fair deal, and we can close this negotiation.",92.5,Alice,5,
