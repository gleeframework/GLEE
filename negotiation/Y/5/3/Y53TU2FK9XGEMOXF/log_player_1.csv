Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. To kick off the negotiations, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground - how about we agree on $16,000?  This would be a fair price reflecting the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $8,000 is a fair price given my current budget. I would like to stick to this figure. If you could meet me halfway, that would be great. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be upfront.  $8,000 is simply too low, and I wouldn't be doing myself justice selling it at that price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see some movement on your end. How about $14,000? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I've considered your proposal, but I still feel that $8,000 is the most I can realistically afford. I hope you can meet me at this price point. If not, I will consider purchasing the product from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is clearly not budging from his $8,000 offer, and it's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed $15,000."
