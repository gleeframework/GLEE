"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $16,500?",16500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $17,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $17,500 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  Let's split the difference again and I'll do $17,000.  That's a fair price for both of us.",17000.0,Bob,4,

"I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $17,000, but I'd like to get a bit more. How about we do $17,250? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",17250.0,Alice,5,
