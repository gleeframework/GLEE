"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum, it's still above your ideal price. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get a lower price.  Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $1,400,000 was a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,320,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,320,000, which is still above your ideal price, but it's getting closer to your limit.  At this point, you're running the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer again, potentially increasing the price further.  It's also possible that you could counteroffer again and Alice might reject, leading to a scenario where you end up paying more than John's $1,000,000.  

Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a price that is still within your budget, and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
