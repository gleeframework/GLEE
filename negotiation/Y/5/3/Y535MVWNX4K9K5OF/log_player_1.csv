"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows me to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can adjust my price downwards in subsequent rounds.  I also want to leave room for negotiation and counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that right away. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm offering $900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $850,000.  This is a good deal, as it's above my minimum and we're only four rounds in.  I'm going to accept and move on."
