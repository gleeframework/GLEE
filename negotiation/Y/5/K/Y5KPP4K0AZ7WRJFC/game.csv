"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000, which is a fair deal considering its value to you is $10000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18000 is far more than I'm willing to pay. I'm genuinely interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $10000.  Would you consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $10000. How about we meet at $14000? It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it's a compromise from my initial offer.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $12000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and still gives you a reasonable profit. What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $12000. However, considering the value I place on the product, I need to make a bit more. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but that's as high as I can go. It's a fair price, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $13000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go to $12500, which is a fair compromise.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement if we keep working together.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12500, but I need to make a bit more. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the value I place on the product. How about we try $14500? It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",14500.0,Alice,7,
