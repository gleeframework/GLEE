Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer is still higher than your desired price, and you've already had several rounds of negotiation without significant progress. You're getting close to your maximum budget, and further negotiation might not yield a better price. It's now more efficient to buy from John, who offers a predictable price within your budget."
