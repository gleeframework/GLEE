"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth exploring potential savings. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, we open the door to potentially negotiating a lower price. Even if we don't get a better price from Alice, we can still choose to buy from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price is a strong negotiating tactic. This shows Alice we're serious about getting a good deal and encourages her to consider a lower price. We'll adjust our strategy based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, it's still above our desired price point. We've already established a willingness to negotiate and are in a good position to push for a lower price. Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice to meet our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're aiming for a gradual decrease in price, showing Alice we're serious about negotiation.  A counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a reasonable compromise, demonstrating our willingness to meet halfway while still trying to secure a better price. This strategy avoids abrupt jumps in price and keeps the negotiation moving smoothly."
