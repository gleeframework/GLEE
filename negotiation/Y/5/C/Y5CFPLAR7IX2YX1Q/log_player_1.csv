"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. It's worth $120 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $115. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what Bob is willing to pay, but still below my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate and encourages Bob to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $120.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a bit too low for me, though. How about we split the difference and go with $110? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. Can we try to find a middle ground? How about $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  $108 is closer to my target, but it's still below my minimum. I'm hoping I can get him to go a bit higher.  We're at the halfway point of our negotiations, so I need to start thinking about the possibility of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $108 is getting closer, but I'm still stuck at $110.  It's my last offer.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm sticking to my last offer of $110. I'm hoping the pressure of potentially losing the deal will encourage Bob to accept. I'm running out of time, so I need to start making decisions that are in my best interest."
