# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else.  Given its value, I'm setting the price at $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer of $20,000 is too high. You know you can get the product for $15,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move on to a better deal."
