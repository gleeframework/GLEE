"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you a price of $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still above my limit. I'm prepared to pay $900000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $900000. I'll make one more concession and offer you a price of $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
