"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I suggest a price of $110 for it. This price reflects not only the cost of production but also ensures a fair profit for us. I trust this offer will meet your expectations and look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $110 is below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive deal. This might prompt Alice to lower her price in a counter-offer. If not, you can always fall back on buying from John for $120."
