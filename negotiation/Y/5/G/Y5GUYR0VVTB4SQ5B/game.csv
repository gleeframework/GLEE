"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about $10,500? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure I can meet you at $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? I really think that's a fair price for this product.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $10,250 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference at $10,375? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",10375.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet at $10,000? I really think that's a fair price for this product, and it's the most I'm willing to pay.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit lower than what I need.  Considering the value of this product to you, I think we can meet in the middle at $10,125. That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal.",10125.0,Alice,7,
