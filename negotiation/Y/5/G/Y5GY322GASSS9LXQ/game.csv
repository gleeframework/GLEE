"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counterpropose a price of $950,000 for your product. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,050,000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000 for your product. I believe this offers a fair solution for both parties involved.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,025,000 is still slightly below where I need to be. Let's split the difference and go with $1,037,500. This feels like a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
