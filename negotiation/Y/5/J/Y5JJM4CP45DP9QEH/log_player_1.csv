"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe we can come to an even better agreement. How about $13000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $12,000. I have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, so there's still room to potentially get a better deal. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I think we can do better. How about $13200 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,200 is now above my minimum desired price of $12,000.  Even though I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I've already gone through 3 rounds of negotiation, and accepting this offer will allow me to finalize the deal.  There's no guarantee that we'll reach a higher price in the remaining rounds, so it's time to secure this deal and avoid the risk of Bob walking away or me having to sell to John for a lower price."
