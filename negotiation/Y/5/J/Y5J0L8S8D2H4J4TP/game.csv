,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $85? I'm really interested in this product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a deal, but $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, how about $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $115 is still a bit too high for me. How about $95? I think this price is fair and allows us both to get a good deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. How about we meet at $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
