"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. I think it's a great deal, considering its value. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. That's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $105 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $92.50. Can you consider that?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $92.50 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $97.50, which is closer to your offer.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from $97.50. I'm willing to meet you at $95. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,6,
