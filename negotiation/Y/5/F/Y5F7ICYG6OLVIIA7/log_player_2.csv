"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further in a subsequent offer to avoid losing the sale. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal."
