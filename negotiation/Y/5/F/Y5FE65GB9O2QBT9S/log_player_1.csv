"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to consider a price of $850,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Alice. However, $925,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, which is $875,000. I'm willing to go up to $887,500, which I believe is a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested in the product and is incrementally increasing his offer. We are still above Jhon's offer, and with 5 rounds remaining, we have room to negotiate further and try to secure a higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your negotiating skills and am eager to find a point where we both feel good.  To show my commitment, I'm willing to come down to $893,750.  This represents a significant move on my part and demonstrates my willingness to close this deal."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. However, $893,750 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, which is $887,500. I'm willing to go up to $890,000, but I think we're getting close to a fair price. Can we meet at $890,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is consistently increasing his offer, and we are now at $890,000.  While we could push for more, the increments are getting smaller, and we risk Bob losing interest. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
