Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $20,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $14,000 is still out of my budget. I'm happy to pay $13,000, and I think that's a fair compromise. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach $15,000. Taking the guaranteed $15,000 from John is the best move to maximize profit."
