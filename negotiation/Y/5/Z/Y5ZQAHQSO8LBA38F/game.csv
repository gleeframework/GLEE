"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, $20,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $12,000 is still a significant way off from what I need.  Would you be willing to consider $14,000? I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $14,000 is still out of my budget. I'm happy to pay $13,000, and I think that's a fair compromise. What do you say?",13000.0,Bob,6,
