"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price given the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'd like to propose $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price. While $1,250,000 is closer to the mark, I'm aiming for a slightly higher figure. Would you consider $1,275,000?  This offer reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your interest.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit away from $1,275,000. I'd like to propose $1,225,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position.  It seems we're getting close. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,260,000? This is my final offer.",1260000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit away from $1,260,000. I'd like to propose $1,230,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",1230000.0,Bob,8,
