# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fantastic price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $900,000, which is $300,000 less than John's price.
* **The product is worth more to Bob than Alice:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, while Alice values it at $800,000. This means Bob can pay more than Alice and still save money.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option for Bob, as it allows him to save money compared to buying from John."
