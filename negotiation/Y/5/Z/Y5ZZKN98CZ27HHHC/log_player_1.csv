Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to get as much as possible, but also want to keep Bob interested in buying from me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I am looking to stay within my budget of $120 for this purchase. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but still above his offer, to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $130.  Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I'm still hoping to find a way to make this work within my $120 limit. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is very close to my minimum price, and I'm confident I can't get any higher. It's better to close the deal now than risk losing him and having to settle for John's offer of $120."
