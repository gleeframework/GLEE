"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that holds significant value, potentially far exceeding $1500000.  While I can't disclose specifics at this time, I'm confident it would be a valuable addition to your portfolio. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $2000000.  This is a chance to acquire something truly special, and I believe the potential returns would justify the investment.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above Bob's budget of $800,000.  Even though Alice claims the product's value is potentially much higher, Bob has no way to verify this.  It's safer to reject the offer and buy from John, who is offering a price within Bob's budget."
