"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $850000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $650000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for some room for negotiation.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $650000. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $725000. This price still reflects the product's value, but also shows my willingness to compromise and find a mutually beneficial agreement.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $725000 is still a bit high for me. I believe a price of $675000 would be more fair, considering the value I see in the product and the price range we're both aiming for. I'm confident this price reflects a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work towards closing this deal.",675000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $675000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering $700000. This price still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $700000 is still above my budget.  I'm feeling confident that we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $685000. This price is a good compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize this deal soon.",685000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your desire to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $685000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm counteroffering $695000. This price is still a compromise, but it's the lowest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",695000.0,Alice,7,
