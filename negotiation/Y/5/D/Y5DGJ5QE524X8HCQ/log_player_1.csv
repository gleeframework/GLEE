Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you would find very valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering a price closer to $150 maximizes your potential profit. However, going too high risks Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Chosen Price:** $130 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit margin for you. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your earnings and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
