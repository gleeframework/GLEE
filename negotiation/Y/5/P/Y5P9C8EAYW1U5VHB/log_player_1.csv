We're getting closer, but I'm still not willing to go that low yet. Let's see if we can meet closer to the middle in the next round."

It's time to cut bait. Bob is clearly trying to haggle me down, and while he might eventually go higher, it's not worth the risk of him lowballing further. John offers a guaranteed $800,000 which is my minimum acceptable price. It's better to take the sure thing at this point."
