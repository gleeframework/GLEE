"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value proposition. However, $120 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $80? I believe it's a fair price that reflects my willingness to buy while still acknowledging the product's quality.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to counter your offer by suggesting a price of $95 for the product.

Let me know if we can move forward with this arrangement.",95.0,Alice,3,
