"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get a better deal. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get a better deal, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to lower my price to $9,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows you to get a good deal. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above your new offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $8,750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,
