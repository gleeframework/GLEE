"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product could bring to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $900,000 is slightly below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to come down from $1,100,000, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that takes into account the value you've mentioned the product has. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
