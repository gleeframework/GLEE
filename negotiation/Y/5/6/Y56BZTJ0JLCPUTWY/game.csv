"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider a price of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,300,000 is a bit below my minimum acceptable price. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price is still very fair, considering the value this product brings to your business.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the current market conditions and my financial situation, I am unable to meet your price of $1,350,000.
