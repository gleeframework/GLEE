Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. Given its worth to you, I believe a price of $1,400,000 would be fair for both of us. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the value it brings."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider a price of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still aiming for a higher amount.  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,300,000 is a bit below my minimum acceptable price. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price is still very fair, considering the value this product brings to your business."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the current market conditions and my financial situation, I am unable to meet your price of $1,350,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,320,000. I hope this proposal will be more in line with what we can agree upon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is still a bit below my preferred price, it's getting close. We're only $30,000 apart, and I don't want to risk losing a deal altogether.  With only 6 rounds left, accepting this offer is the most logical choice to secure a decent profit."
