Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. While I appreciate its value, I believe $900,000 would be a fair price for me to invest in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I still feel that $850,000 would be a fair price for me to acquire it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

At this point, Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than risk getting stuck in a protracted negotiation with Bob."
