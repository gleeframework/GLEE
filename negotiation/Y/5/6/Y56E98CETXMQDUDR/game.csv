"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, and I know it will be just as valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This reflects the product's unique value and the potential benefits you'll realize. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider a counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While I value this product highly, I'm also realistic about finding a fair price for both of us. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll consider it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the compromise, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,050,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you consider another counteroffer?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I can't go below $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value this product holds.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable paying $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $975,000. This is my final offer. Can you consider it?",975000.0,Bob,6,
