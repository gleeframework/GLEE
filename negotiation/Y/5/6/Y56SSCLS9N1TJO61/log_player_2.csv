Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. Bob should reject this offer and try to negotiate further. There's still potential to get a better price from Alice, as her value for the product is significantly lower than Bob's."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to John's price. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a high chance Alice will refuse to go lower, and Bob might end up paying $1,000,000 anyway. 

It's better to cut losses and buy the product from John at $1,000,000. It's still within Bob's budget and ensures a quicker purchase."
