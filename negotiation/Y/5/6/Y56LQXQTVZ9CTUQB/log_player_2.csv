"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. It's a great value considering its worth to us and its high quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You can get the product for $100 from John, so it doesn't make sense to accept Alice's offer of $120.  You should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, I'm only willing to pay $100 for it at this time.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm unable to meet you halfway on this one. I would like to offer the product to you for $110, which is still above its perceived value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice has already rejected your counteroffer of $100, and is now offering $110.  Since you can get the product from John for $100, it's better to go with John."
