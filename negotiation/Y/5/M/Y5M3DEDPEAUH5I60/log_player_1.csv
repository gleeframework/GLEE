Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's a valuable piece, and I'm confident this price is fair. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially getting closer to my desired price. 
* **Positive tone:** Using a friendly tone helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Highlighting value:** Mentioning the product's value reinforces its worth and justifies the price.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message explicitly invites Bob to discuss the offer, signaling flexibility. 

This approach aims to find a balance between maximizing my profit and keeping the negotiation open and amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  It also doesn't leave much room for further negotiation to reach a price closer to my goal.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try and counteroffer, potentially pushing the price higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $8,500 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This reflects the value of the product and is still a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $10,000 is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify the price, keeping in mind Bob's initial statement about appreciating the product's worth.
* **Staying firm:**  I don't go all the way down to Bob's offer, indicating that I'm not desperate to sell and have a clear idea of the product's worth. 
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone keeps the conversation open and encourages Bob to consider my counteroffer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although $9,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, I'm still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. Given the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob, potentially leading to a lower price or a stalemate, I've decided to cut my losses and sell the product to John. This guarantees me my minimum desired profit and allows me to avoid further uncertainty with Bob."
