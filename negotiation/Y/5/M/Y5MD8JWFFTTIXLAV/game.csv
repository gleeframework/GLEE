"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your response, Bob.  I understand your perspective on the value.  To be candid, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring the deal remains beneficial for both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to consider $1,225,000? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
