"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation. Since I don't know Bob's value, I'll see if he's willing to bite at a price significantly above my minimum. If he doesn't, I'll adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $18,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for more. I have 8 rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price range. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm going to counter with $19,000. This is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still keeping a good profit margin. I'll see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $17,500 is getting closer to my minimum, and we're already halfway through the rounds.  It's a good deal, and I'm not sure I'll get a better one.  I'll accept and move on."
