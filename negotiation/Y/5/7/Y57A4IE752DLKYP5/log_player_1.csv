Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the dynamics:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. The $1,000,000 offer aims to test his upper limit and potentially secure a significant profit.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity,"" ""value,"" and ""potential,"" the message subtly justifies the high price without explicitly stating why it's worth that much to Bob.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer. It doesn't sound like an ultimatum, allowing for a more natural negotiation flow.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., very price-sensitive, open to high-value propositions), adjust the message and price accordingly.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John's offer. Use this to your advantage, but be prepared for the possibility of him rejecting the offer.
 
Let me know if you'd like to explore other strategies or adjust the offer!"
