"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a discounted price. I'm asking $10,000 for it.  This is a great deal, and it's less than what I would get from another buyer.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
