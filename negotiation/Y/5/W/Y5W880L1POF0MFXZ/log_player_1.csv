Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $120.  I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll try to counteroffer one more time and see if we can reach a compromise.  If Bob isn't willing to budge, I'll consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $105?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.
