"I understand you're interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to meet you halfway just yet. I'm willing to consider a compromise, but I need to get a bit closer to my initial offer. How about we meet at $105? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to sweeten the pot.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $95? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
