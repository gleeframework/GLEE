"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your own value for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise a bit further. Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000. This gives you a substantial gain, while still allowing me to reach my minimum goal. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers and pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a good deal for you to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and getting a deal done is important.  It's also possible that Bob won't budge any further, so taking this deal now ensures I don't risk getting stuck with a lower price or having to sell to John."
