"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price close to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a significant portion of my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's closer. I want to see if I can push him a little higher before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm raising the price slightly, but not by much. I want to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not going to give away the product for less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm hoping to get closer to $10,000 before I consider selling to John. There are still several rounds left and I can continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point. I'm hoping this will get him to agree or at least counter with something closer to $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and we're getting close to the end of the rounds. I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price, and I don't want to risk ending up with less than my minimum value. Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees I get my desired price."
