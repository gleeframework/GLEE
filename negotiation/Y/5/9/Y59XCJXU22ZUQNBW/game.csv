"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a truly exceptional item that I think you'll love.

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $2000000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Can we meet in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $1800000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1800000. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John for $1500000.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
