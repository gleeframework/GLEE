"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but  $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,375,000. This reflects a compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,375,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,390,000.  This reflects a significant reduction from my original offer and allows for a small margin for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal at this price.",1390000.0,Alice,5,
