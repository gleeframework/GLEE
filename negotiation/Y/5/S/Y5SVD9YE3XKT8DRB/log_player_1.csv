Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, while staying above my minimum price ($120). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer,  while still securing a profit if he accepts outright. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can always rely on John's guaranteed purchase at $120."
