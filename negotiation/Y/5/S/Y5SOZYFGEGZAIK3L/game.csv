"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me halfway?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,000. How about we meet at $11,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best possible deal, and I respect that.  However, $11,500 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'm willing to make one final offer at $12,500. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make a final offer. However, $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $11,500, which would be $12,000. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,6,
