"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $900,000.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,100,000. This offer reflects its worth while still providing you with a good deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price.  Let's meet in the middle a bit - how about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground. How about we split the difference from our previous offers and settle at $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, that's getting closer.  I'm willing to go up slightly to $1,000,000 even.  That's the best I can do.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
