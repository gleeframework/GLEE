Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $900,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,100,000. This offer reflects its worth while still providing you with a good deal."",

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

While Bob is moving closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. We're early in the negotiation, and I'm willing to hold firm for now."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's getting closer.  I'm willing to go up slightly to $1,000,000 even.  That's the best I can do.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Bob has now met my minimum acceptable price. While I could potentially push for more, there's a risk he walks away. Accepting this offer guarantees I make a good profit."
