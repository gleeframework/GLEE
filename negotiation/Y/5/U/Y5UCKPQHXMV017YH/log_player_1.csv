Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,000. It's a great deal on a product I know you'll value."", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Knowing Bob's Value:** Since you know the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, starting at $9,000 gives him some room to negotiate down while still staying above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John, so you can afford to be a bit bolder in your initial offer to Bob."
