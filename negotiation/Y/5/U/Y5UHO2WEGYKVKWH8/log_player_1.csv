Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer. While we're moving closer to a potential deal with Bob, it's important to keep negotiating to maximize our potential profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's try this â€“ $1,975,000. It's a small adjustment, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value and keeps us moving towards a deal."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer at $1,925,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,925,000. 
You have three options:

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is consistently increasing his offer, and we are now at $1,925,000. This is significantly higher than John's offer of $1,500,000.  While there's a chance Bob might go slightly higher, the risk of him walking away versus the potential for a small increase isn't worth it at this point. It's better to secure a good deal now."
