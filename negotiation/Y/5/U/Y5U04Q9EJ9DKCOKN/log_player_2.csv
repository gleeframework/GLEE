"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $14,000. I think this is a great price considering the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You can save at least $1,000 by negotiating with Alice.  Since you are willing to pay up to $15,000, there is room for a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $13,800. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800

Alice's offer of $13,800 is within your budget and still saves you money compared to buying from John.  It's a good deal, and it's worth accepting to finalize the purchase."
