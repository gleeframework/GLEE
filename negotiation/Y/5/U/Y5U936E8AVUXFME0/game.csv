"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to pay closer to $500,000, but I'm still hoping to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $550,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",550000.0,Alice,3,
