Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  It's a fair price, and it gets us both closer to our goals. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $11,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit too far from my goal.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.
