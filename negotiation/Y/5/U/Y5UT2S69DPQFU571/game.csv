"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point. I'm really interested in this product, but $9000 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $8500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9250. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $9250 is still a bit above my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9000? That's a fair compromise and a great price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to the original offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway from the last offer, which was $9250. I'll offer you $9375. This is my best compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",9375.0,Alice,5,
