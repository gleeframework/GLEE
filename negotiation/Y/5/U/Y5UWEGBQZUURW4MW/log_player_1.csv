Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Aiming for the highest price Bob might accept maximizes potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $12,000 is Bob's perceived value, he'll likely try to negotiate down. Starting at $10,000 allows room for this.
* **Above Reserve Price:** The offer is significantly above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($8,000), ensuring a good profit even if Bob negotiates.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiation style or how badly he needs the product.  If she had more information, a different approach might be optimal."
