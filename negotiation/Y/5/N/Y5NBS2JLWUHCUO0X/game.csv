"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I know it's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I believe this is a fair price considering your specific needs. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay full price. ",900000.0,Alice,1,
