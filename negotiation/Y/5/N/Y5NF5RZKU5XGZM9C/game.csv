"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? It's a win-win that reflects the value this product brings.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
