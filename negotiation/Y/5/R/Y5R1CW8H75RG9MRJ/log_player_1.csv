Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also leaves room for a counteroffer from Bob, keeping the negotiation going.  

However, I'm also aware that John is willing to pay $12,000. So, I'll be keeping a close eye on the negotiations and might choose to sell to John if Bob doesn't accept a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $12,000. While it's tempting to accept his offer, I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price. 

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value, hopefully finding a middle ground between our expectations. However, I'll keep John's offer in mind and might choose to sell to him if negotiations with Bob become too difficult."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,500 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,500. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price of $12,000, Bob's offer of $10,000 is close enough to my minimum desired value.  I'm concerned that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate, and I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a reasonable profit."
