I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This gives Bob a good incentive to negotiate, but still leaves me with a profit over my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to $850,000, which is still above my minimum but shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate."

Bob has offered my minimum price. I don't want to risk losing him and potentially getting a lower price later, so I'll accept his offer."
