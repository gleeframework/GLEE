"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Value Proposition:** I mention the product's value to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Open Ended Question:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I am interested in purchasing it, but my budget is limited. Could we negotiate the price down to $17000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value & Potential:** While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000. I believe there's room for further negotiation to reach a price closer to my target. 
* **More Rounds:** We have 9 rounds left, providing opportunities to negotiate further and potentially secure a better price.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John guarantees $15,000, rejecting Bob's offer keeps the possibility of earning more open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $17,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 18500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a counteroffer that shows I'm willing to compromise, but still maintains a price above my minimum value.
* **Middle Ground:** The counteroffer of $18,500 is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Fairness:** I emphasize the ""fairness"" of the price for both of us to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $16500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value of $15,000. However, there's still a gap.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I've already demonstrated flexibility and willingness to negotiate. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to potentially get a better price.
* **Remaining Rounds:** With 6 rounds left, I still have time to push for a higher price. 
* **John's Offer:** While selling to John for $15,000 is a safe option, it's not the most profitable. I'm still hoping to get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $16,500 is still below my minimum value.  Given the product's unique qualities and our ongoing negotiation, I'm willing to come down to $17,000 as a final compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I emphasize this as a ""final compromise"" to signal that I'm not willing to go lower.
* **Value Justification:**  I remind Bob of the product's unique qualities to justify the price point.
* **Pressure:** I use a question (""What do you think?"") to pressure Bob into making a decision and potentially accept the offer.
* **Minimizing Loss:** While $17,000 is not ideal, it's still higher than John's offer and closer to my desired range."
