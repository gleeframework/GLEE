"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly higher than her value of $800,000. There's a lot of room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob's offer is a significant decrease from Alice's opening price, indicating his seriousness about negotiating.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $900,000 is still a profit for Alice, but it also leaves room for further negotiation in the following rounds.
* **Openness to Compromise:** The message emphasizes Bob's willingness to find a mutually acceptable price, keeping the negotiation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Improvement:** While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's counteroffer. There's still room for further negotiation, especially since Bob has a clear limit of $1,500,000.
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Accepting the offer would mean Bob pays more than his target price. By rejecting, he keeps the possibility of getting a better price open.
* **Maintain Leverage:** Continuing the negotiation shows Alice that Bob is serious about finding a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we settle on $925,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Change:**  The counteroffer is a smaller step down from Alice's last offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway while still maintaining leverage.
* **Fairness Focus:** The message highlights the benefit for both parties, emphasizing a fair and mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Building Momentum:** Bob's counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while remaining within his budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $935,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $935,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $935,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Alice's offer of $935,000 is just a small step away from Bob's last counteroffer of $925,000. This indicates a strong likelihood that further negotiation will only result in minor adjustments.
* **Avoiding Risk:** With only 5 rounds remaining, continuing to reject and counteroffer risks Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further. It also increases the chance that Bob might have to buy from John at a much higher price.
* **Acceptable Price:** While $935,000 is not ideal for Bob, it's significantly lower than his $1,500,000 limit and represents a good deal considering the potential risks of continuing negotiation."
