Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $11,500, which is $12,750. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $12,750. It's time to cut your losses and go with your guaranteed option of buying from John for $12,000."
