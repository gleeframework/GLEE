"Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a better price. There's no guarantee of success, but it's worth trying to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount from Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it shows Bob is serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if necessary. This approach aims to get Alice to consider a lower price quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's counteroffer. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or refusing additional counteroffers increases. Accepting the offer at $700,000 saves Bob $300,000 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially advantageous choice at this point."
