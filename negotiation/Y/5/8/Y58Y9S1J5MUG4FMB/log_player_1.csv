Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a better agreement. How about $12,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I understand his position, I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for the same amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $12,000 just doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $12,500? This is a fair price considering its worth to both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I've done some research and I believe $12,000 is a fair price given the market value of the product. I hope we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is insistent on $12,000, and I've already made a concession in the previous round.  While I could keep negotiating, the risk is that the rounds will continue, and I may end up with a lower price or no deal at all.  John offers a guaranteed $12,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to move on and secure the deal."
