Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you and a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $10,000 is higher than Bob's $8,000 valuation, giving him room to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  $10,000 is still above your minimum of $12,000, ensuring you make a profit. 
* **It's a reasonable first offer:**  It's not too aggressive, giving Bob a chance to feel like he can get a good deal. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to maintain your position and potentially negotiate a better deal.  You have a backup option with John, so there's no rush to settle for less than you're comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250, which is a fair compromise. Let's try to work this out."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:**  This counteroffer shows flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Still above your minimum:**  $9,250 is still above your minimum of $12,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is a compromise by meeting halfway between your previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. 
* **Positive language:** The message emphasizes a desire to find a solution and maintain a positive tone.

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet you in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,000? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:**  While $9,000 is still below your desired price, it's very close to your minimum of $12,000, making it a reasonable compromise. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Accepting Bob's offer now doesn't preclude you from potentially negotiating further with him in the future if opportunities arise.
* **Time is money:**  Prolonging the negotiation with Bob could risk losing him as a buyer and potentially losing your backup option with John.

This offer allows you to secure a sale and make a reasonable profit while minimizing the risk of losing both buyers."
