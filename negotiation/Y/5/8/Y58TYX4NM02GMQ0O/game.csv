"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint. While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop the price to $900,000. This still allows you to get a great deal while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the compromise, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $900,000. Can you consider $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $875,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit too low. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $887,500.  This would be a win-win for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",887500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider one more concession? I'm willing to meet you at $882,500?",882500.0,Bob,6,
