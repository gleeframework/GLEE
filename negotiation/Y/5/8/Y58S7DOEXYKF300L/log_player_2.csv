"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal is to save as much money as possible.**  $120 is still too high for you, as your maximum is $150.
* **You have 10 rounds.** This gives you room to negotiate.
* **You can buy from John for $150.** This acts as a safety net, so you don't have to accept an unreasonable price from Alice.

By rejecting the offer, you can start the counteroffer process and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm offering $105, which is a significant decrease from Alice's $120. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not going too low initially, as I want to give Alice room to counter without feeling pressured. 
* **Considering my max:**  $105 is still within my acceptable range ($150), but leaves me some room to negotiate further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** $130 is closer to my maximum, but I'm still aiming to save more.
* **We have 7 rounds left.** This gives me time to negotiate further. 
* **I have the option to buy from John.** This means I'm not desperate to close the deal with Alice immediately.

I'll continue to reject offers that are too high and try to get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progressing toward a deal:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from $105 to $115, showing that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Staying within my budget:** $115 is still within my maximum budget of $150, and leaves room for a potential middle ground.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer lets me see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** Although it's lower than her previous offer, $135 is still outside of my desired price range.
* **We have 5 rounds left.**  This gives me time to negotiate further and push for a better price.
* **I can still buy from John.** This means I'm not forced to accept Alice's offer if it's not beneficial to me. 

I'll continue to reject offers that are too high and try to get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm increasing my offer significantly to $120, which is halfway between my previous offer ($115) and Alice's last offer ($135). 
* **Signaling willingness to compromise:** This shows Alice that I'm serious about closing the deal and willing to meet her halfway. 
* **Still within budget:** $120 is still within my acceptable range, but it's getting closer to my maximum. 
* **Limited rounds:** We only have 4 rounds left, so I need to find a middle ground soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  $140 is getting dangerously close to my maximum budget of $150. 
* **We only have 3 rounds left.**  Time is running out, and I need to be strategic.
* **I still have the option to buy from John.** This gives me a safety net if we can't reach a mutually agreeable price. 

By rejecting this offer, I can make one last counteroffer to try and secure a better deal. If that fails, I'll have to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** With only 2 rounds remaining, I need to make a strong final counteroffer. 
* **Balancing risk and reward:** $125 is a compromise between my previous offer of $120 and Alice's last offer of $140.
* **Potential for acceptance:**  I'm hoping this offer is appealing enough for Alice to accept, considering the limited time and the fact that she's already lowered her price significantly. 
* **Back-up plan:** If Alice rejects, I'll likely have to buy from John for $150, as this is my final round to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** This is the final round of negotiation.
* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $145 is only $5 lower than John's price, which is my maximum limit.
* **No room for further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that Alice will accept my counteroffer in the final round, and even if she does, it's unlikely to be at a price that is significantly lower than her current offer.

It's more beneficial to buy from John for $150, even though it's my maximum, because I'm guaranteed a deal, and I don't risk wasting this final round with no outcome."
