Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120). This gives Bob a sense of a good deal and encourages negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $100, I leave room for counteroffers and potential compromises.  
* **John as a Backup:** The presence of John as a buyer willing to pay my minimum price provides me with a safety net, allowing me to walk away if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I can only pay up to $90 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's not profitable enough for me.  I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price through further negotiation.
* **John as Backup:** The existence of John as a buyer willing to pay $120 provides me with the security to continue negotiating with Bob without losing out entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $95?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing $95 as a ""fair price for both of us"" to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob gets by highlighting the ""great deal"" he's receiving.

**Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to:

* Push Bob closer to my desired price range.
* Maintain the negotiation process, keeping the door open for a potential agreement.
*  Show flexibility without sacrificing too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate it. I'm still not able to go above $90 for the product. Would $92 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While $92 is still below my ideal price, it's only $8 less than my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away entirely, leaving me with only John's offer of $120. Accepting $92 guarantees a sale and reduces the risk of ending up with nothing. 
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing the negotiation could be time-consuming, potentially delaying the sale and potentially leading to a lower offer from Bob.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer at $92 is the most sensible decision at this point. It's a reasonable compromise, and the risk of continuing to negotiate outweighs the potential reward of a few more dollars."
