"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, but $13,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go to $9,500. If you're not interested, I'll have to go with John's offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll make a counteroffer of $11,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm still confident it's a fair price for the product.",11250.0,Alice,5,
