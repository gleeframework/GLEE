"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,750,000, knowing it's higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high as to instantly scare him off. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price leaves space for negotiation and allows for potential counteroffers from Bob.
* **Positive message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob. 
* **Focus on the deal:** I'm not mentioning John or the fallback option at this stage to avoid putting unnecessary pressure on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is key:**  There are still 9 rounds left, and I believe there's room for a more favorable deal with Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if we can find common ground. 
* **John is a backup:** While John's offer of $1,500,000 is tempting,  I'm not ready to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me at this stage. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a lower price:** I'm dropping my price by $150,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintain a high price:** The counteroffer of $1,600,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't sell below my own value.
* **Focus on the deal:** I'm highlighting that this price is a good deal for both of us, creating a sense of mutual benefit. 
* **Bridging the gap:** The message emphasizes a desire to find a compromise and encourages Bob to consider my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1300000. Can we discuss further?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and significantly lower than my starting price. 
* **Negotiation continues:**  There are still 6 rounds left, and I believe we can reach a more agreeable price.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going.
* **John is still a backup:** John's offer of $1,500,000 is a strong fallback, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better deal from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is simply too far below my bottom line.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a significant opportunity.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm stance:** While showing willingness to negotiate, I'm emphasizing that $1,300,000 is unacceptable.
* **Compromise with a limit:** I'm lowering my price again to $1,550,000, demonstrating flexibility while staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Appeal to value and opportunity:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and highlighting the potential benefits he could gain from the deal.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $1200000. Can we discuss further?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too many concessions:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've already made significant concessions and I'm not willing to go any lower.
* **Time is running out:** We're halfway through the negotiation rounds, and the risk of getting a worse deal or no deal at all is increasing.
* **John is the safe bet:** John's offer of $1,500,000 is guaranteed and meets my minimum requirement.  It's time to secure this deal and avoid further potential losses."
