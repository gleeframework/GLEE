Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is above Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Encouraging acceptance:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, highlighting the potential benefit to him. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not going for a hard-line approach, allowing for the possibility of Bob making a counteroffer. 
* **Keeping John as a safety net:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm not overly pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While it's closer to my target, $1,100,000 is still less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push for a higher price in the next round.
* **John is a valuable backup:**  Having John as a potential buyer gives me leverage in negotiations. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's try to find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,150,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Still above my minimum:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I'm not selling below my desired threshold.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  I'm reframing the negotiation by emphasizing the benefit for both of us.  This could encourage Bob to see the value in accepting a slightly higher price. 
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** I'm not giving in completely, but I'm also showing I'm open to negotiation.  This creates a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position and am willing to consider a price of $1,125,000 for your product. I hope this proposal helps us reach an agreement that is satisfactory for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob has moved closer to my target, $1,125,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** I believe there's still room for improvement. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push for a higher price in the next round.
* **John is a secure fallback:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay my minimum price gives me confidence to hold out for a better deal from Bob. 

I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what John is offering, so I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,137,500.  This price is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can offer.  Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 1137500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm not giving in entirely. This shows I'm serious about negotiation, but I'm also not desperate to close the deal.
* **Still above my minimum:** $1,137,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This ensures I'm not losing money on the deal.
* **Creating urgency:**  I'm stating this is my ""best offer,"" creating a sense of urgency for Bob to decide before the opportunity passes.
* **Focusing on fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect of the offer to make it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts, Alice. Considering the negotiations we've had, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,130,000 for your product. I believe this price is fair for both of us and brings us closer to reaching an agreement.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation stalled:** Bob's offer is only $2,500 higher than my last counteroffer.  It seems unlikely that we'll reach a mutually agreeable price through further negotiation. 
* **John's offer is significantly better:** John is willing to pay $1,500,000, which is a much more profitable deal for me. 
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and ultimately resulting in a lower price than I could get from John.

It's time to cut my losses and move on to the more lucrative option with John."
