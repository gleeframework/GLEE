Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Acceptable Price:** You need to make at least $120, so offering it for less is not an option.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100, so you need to offer a price that's attractive to him but still profitable for you.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $115 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 

By offering the product at $115, you maximize your chances of making a profit while still making the offer appealing to Bob."
