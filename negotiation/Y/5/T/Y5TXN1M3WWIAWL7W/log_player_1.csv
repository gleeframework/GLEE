This offer gives me a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a price above my minimum.  I've left room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal, while still getting a significant profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $8,500 is above my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Bob's offer is still below my preferred price, but it's only slightly below my minimum and represents a significant profit.  It's better to accept and avoid risking further negotiation.  There's always a chance Bob will walk away, and selling to John for $8,000 would be a significant loss."
