"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Can you meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, though.  How about $9000? It's still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $10000.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $8200? It's still a good deal for me, and I'm willing to compromise.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8200 just isn't going to work for me.  Let's try to split the difference again.  How about $8600?  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the sale.",8600.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $8300? It's still a bit above your original price, but I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us.",8300.0,Bob,6,
