Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,500 is too low for me, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not comfortable with $9,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,800 is pretty close to my minimum price.  Since I only have 6 rounds left and John is always an option, I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
