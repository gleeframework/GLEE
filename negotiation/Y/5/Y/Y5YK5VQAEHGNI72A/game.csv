"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. While I appreciate the value of the product, I'm only able to offer $800000 right now. This is my best and final offer. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value and rarity, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still outside of my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $800000. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
