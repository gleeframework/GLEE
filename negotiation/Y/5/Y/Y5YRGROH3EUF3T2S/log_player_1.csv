Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $18,000. This is a good starting point because it allows for some room for negotiation and potentially gets Bob to reveal some information about his value of the product. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value, and selling to John would net me a better price. However, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to counter with $15,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's a significant increase from his offer, but it's still lower than what I ideally want. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to increase his offer further or at least reveal more about his value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but it's the same as what I can get from John. Since there is no potential for further negotiation to increase the price, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John immediately."
