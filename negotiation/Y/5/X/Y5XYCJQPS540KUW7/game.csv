"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the opportunity it presents. Let's see if we can close this deal. ",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay and the value you're placing on the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the fact that we're getting closer. $900,000 is a good offer, but I'm still holding out for $925,000. This price reflects the significant value of the product, and it's a great opportunity for you to secure it. Let's work together to finalize this deal!",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still slightly above what I can afford right now. I'm willing to meet you at $910,000. This is a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. Let's make this deal happen.",910000.0,Bob,6,
