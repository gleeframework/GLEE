"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is cheaper than John's price, it's still above Bob's ideal price. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to Alice's minimum price as possible.  $12,500 is a good starting point for the counteroffer, as it is halfway between Bob's maximum and Alice's minimum. This shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good compromise. It's lower than John's price and closer to Bob's ideal price. Further negotiation might get a slightly lower price, but it's not worth the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and potentially leading to a higher price or losing the product.  Accepting this offer ensures a good deal for Bob."
