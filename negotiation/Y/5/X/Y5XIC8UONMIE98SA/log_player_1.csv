Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $16,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's my final offer. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that $14,000 is his absolute limit. While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll get a better offer from him. Accepting his offer would mean a $1,000 loss compared to John's offer.  It's in our best interest to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
