Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $9,500 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm very interested in your product, but I'm only able to go up to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and allows for some profit for you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
