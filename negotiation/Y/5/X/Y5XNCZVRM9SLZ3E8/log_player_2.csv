"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. I'll sell it to you for $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still save $100,000 by rejecting her offer and negotiating with John. There's a chance John will be willing to lower his price to beat Alice's offer, or at the very least, you can try to negotiate a better price with him."
