"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth exploring negotiation before accepting the initial offer. There's a chance Alice is willing to lower the price, and even a small discount can save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have to consider my minimum selling price, and $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved from her initial price of $1,200,000 to $1,050,000, which is a significant discount. Accepting her offer saves $150,000 compared to buying from John and is a good deal considering there are only 7 rounds left.  Further negotiation might yield a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to another buyer or running out of rounds outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal."
