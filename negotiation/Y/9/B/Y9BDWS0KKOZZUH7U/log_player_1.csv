Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with some further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  It's a fair price considering the value to you, and it gets us both closer to our goals."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 4

While $11,500 is getting closer, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I believe with a little more negotiation, I can secure a better price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob's offer of $12,200 is very close to my target price. It's better than my last counteroffer and significantly higher than selling to John.  I'll accept this offer to secure the sale."
