Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a strategic compromise:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000),**  showing Bob the potential for a good deal.
* **It's lower than the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000),**  giving him room to negotiate and still feel like he's getting a good price. 

By aiming for a middle ground, you increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer while still securing a profitable sale."
