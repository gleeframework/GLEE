"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1,350,000? This price allows me to reach my desired profit margin while still providing you with a significant value for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,300,000? This price seems more reasonable to me, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
