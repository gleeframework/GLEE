,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $95. That's still a great deal for you and it's closer to what I need. Let me know if that works for you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
