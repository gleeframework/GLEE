"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While the product looks great, $150 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $130. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $15. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal!",125.0,Alice,5,
