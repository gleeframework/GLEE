"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good deal compared to John's $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $8,500? It's still a good price for you, and a good deal for me. "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, but it's still within the range of what's potentially acceptable to both parties. He's emphasizing the value of the deal for Alice, hoping to encourage her to accept the counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000.  This still gives you a great deal, as the product is worth $10000 to you.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. While $9,000 is closer to his goal, he can likely still get a better deal. There are still several rounds left, and he can continue to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue the bargaining process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $9,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,800, which is still a good deal for you. This shows I'm serious about buying the product and we can close this deal. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a more moderate counteroffer, closer to Alice's last offer, but still pushing for a lower price. He's trying to strike a balance between getting a good deal and not risking losing the sale to John. By emphasizing the value of the deal for both parties, Bob hopes to encourage Alice to accept the counteroffer."
