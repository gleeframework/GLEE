"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable piece and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about $850,000? This price is still fair considering the product's value, and it gives you a good deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $700,000. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you want to meet in the middle, but $775,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  How about $812,500? This price reflects both our desired values, and it allows us to finalize this deal.",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $812,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $810,000, but no higher. I'm really interested in making this deal happen, but I need to stay within my budget.",810000.0,Bob,6,
