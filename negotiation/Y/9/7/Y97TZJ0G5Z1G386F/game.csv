"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product,  $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product.  This price is fair considering the value to me and allows for a healthy profit for you. I'm open to further discussion.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850000.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further.  While $880000 is closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that's more in line with my initial offer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $860000. This reflects a genuine desire to find a deal that works for both of us.  Let's close this gap and finalize the agreement.",860000.0,Bob,6,
