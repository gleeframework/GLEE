"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to initiate a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better deal, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm not yet ready to accept, but I'm hopeful we can reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  However, I'm still aiming for a lower figure. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product.  Let's work together to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $825,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $835,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $835,000 is very close to my desired price.  With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice is increasing.  While I could try to push for a lower price, there's a chance she'll become less flexible and I may end up paying more than $835,000.  Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a good price and avoids the potential of a stalemate."
