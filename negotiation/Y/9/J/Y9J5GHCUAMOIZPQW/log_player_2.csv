"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can negotiate a better price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price, especially if she values a deal more than getting the full $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it signals my serious intent to buy while also establishing a strong negotiating position.  I'm hoping to get a deal closer to my budget, but I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at my maximum budget.  While I'd prefer to pay less, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation. If I reject, Alice might raise her price again, or I could end up buying from John at the same price. It's better to accept this offer and secure the product."
