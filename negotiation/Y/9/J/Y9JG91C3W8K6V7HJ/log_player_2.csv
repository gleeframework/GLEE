Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $11,250. This is a fair price that still benefits both of us.
