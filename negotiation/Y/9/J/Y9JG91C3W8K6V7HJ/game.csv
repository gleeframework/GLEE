"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it, which is still a good price for you considering your valuation. Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,500. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I'm still a little out of my range at $11,500.  Let's split the difference and meet at $11,000. It's a fair price for both of us and keeps the deal moving forward.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $11,250. This is a fair price that still benefits both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
