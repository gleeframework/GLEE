"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,750,000. It's a steal at this price, considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a range that might be enticing given the potential benefit he sees in the product. 
* **Creating urgency:**  The message highlights the ""steal"" aspect, pushing Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counter, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit. By starting high, I can see if I can get close to my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).  If Bob rejects, I can analyze his counteroffers and adjust accordingly.  I also have the option to sell to John at any point, which acts as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would mean losing out on a considerable amount of money.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, he clearly expressed interest in the product. This presents an opportunity to negotiate further and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Utilizing the safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me the leverage to hold firm and push for a higher price from Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will counter with a price that's more in line with my expectations. My goal is to slowly bring the price closer to my desired range without risking selling at a significantly discounted rate.  I'm confident that the potential for a deal with Bob and the safety net of John's offer will allow me to achieve this."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for this exceptional product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price still reflects the significant value this product brings, while being more attainable for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Leverage:** I'm making a compromise by reducing my price, but I'm still significantly above Bob's last offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also highlights the value of the product.
* **Clear Communication:**  I reiterate the product's value and offer a specific price to avoid endless back-and-forth.
* **Maintaining the safety net:**  Knowing I can still sell to John for a higher price gives me confidence in my counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strategic step towards my desired price range. I'm testing the waters and seeing how receptive Bob is to a higher price. If he rejects again, I'll adjust my counteroffer in the next round, always keeping my minimum acceptable price and John's offer in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000? I think that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Bob has shown some flexibility by moving closer to my price. This indicates there's still room for negotiation.
* **Safety net still in place:**  I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, allowing me to continue pushing for a higher price from Bob.

**Strategy:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not acceptable. I will reject his offer and continue the negotiation. In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer slightly closer to Bob's offer but still ensuring a profit. My goal is to maximize my earnings while being aware of the time limit and the option to sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction, but we're still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which represents a fair compromise for both of us. This product is truly exceptional, and I believe this price accurately reflects its value.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by reducing my price further, but it's still closer to my minimum acceptable price than Bob's offer.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate the product's exceptional qualities, subtly reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Closing the Gap:** This offer aims to narrow the gap between our positions and nudge Bob towards a more favorable price for me.
* **Urgency Implied:** My message subtly implies that this might be my final offer, creating a sense of urgency.

**Strategy:**

I'm cautiously moving closer to Bob's offer, but not sacrificing too much. I want to see if this counteroffer is enough to convince him. If he rejects, I'll have to consider a more significant compromise in the next round, while still ensuring I can meet my minimum profit. My safety net with John gives me the freedom to negotiate more aggressively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to save some money. How about $1,250,000? I think that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I cannot afford to sell at this price.
* **Limited Time:** We are now nearing the halfway point of our 10 rounds, emphasizing the need to be strategic.
* **Potential for a deal:**  While Bob's offer is still too low, he is clearly interested in the product and has shown a willingness to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation.  While I'm not comfortable selling for $1,250,000, I believe we can reach a deal if I make one final counteroffer that shows compromise but still protects my profit margin. My safety net with John allows me to take a calculated risk and continue pushing for a better price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close to a deal. While I appreciate your budget constraints,  $1,250,000 just won't work for me.  I'm prepared to make one final concession - how about $1,325,000? This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it represents a fair price considering the value this product holds for you.  Let's finalize this agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  This counteroffer signals my final willingness to compromise.  While it's still above Bob's offer, it's a significant move towards his position.
* **Urgency and Finality:**  The message emphasizes this as a final offer, creating pressure on Bob to accept. 
* **Fair Value:**  I reiterate the product's value to Bob, reminding him that this price still offers significant benefit.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a calculated risk. I'm pushing for a deal close to my minimum acceptable price while still leaving some room for negotiation. The urgency I've injected could prompt Bob to accept. If he rejects, I'll have to evaluate my options carefully, considering the time limit and my safety net with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but no lower. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm getting a bit concerned that I might be leaving money on the table if I go any lower. Can you meet me at $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $1,300,000 is only $200,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's within a reasonable range.
* **Limited Time:** We are now in round 8, and there are only a few rounds left.  Time is becoming a factor.
* **Potential for Deal:**  Bob has shown a strong interest in the product, and this offer indicates a willingness to reach a deal.

**Strategy:**

Given the limited time and the potential to lose out on a deal altogether, I've decided to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a solid deal that allows me to secure a sale within a reasonable timeframe.  The risk of waiting for a higher offer is too great, as I may end up with no deal at all."
