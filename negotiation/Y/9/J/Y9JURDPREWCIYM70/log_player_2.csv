"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $15,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond your initial assessment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point to see how Alice reacts. It's significantly lower than her asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is considerably higher than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to your acceptable price range, $11,000 is still above your limit. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $11,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counteroffer moves closer to your maximum price but stays below it.  It aims to find a price point where you get a good deal and Alice still makes a reasonable profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a fair price, but $7,000 is too low.  My final offer is $9,500.  I believe that's a very competitive price for the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting very close to your maximum price, but you can still try one more time to get a slightly better deal.  It's worth seeing if she'll budge those last few hundred dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand this is your final offer, Alice, and it's close to what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to settle at $8,000?  That's the absolute highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

This counteroffer makes it clear to Alice that $8,000 is your absolute limit. It's a firm offer but presented politely to maintain a good negotiating relationship.  Let's see how she responds!"
