Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend closer to $5,000, but I'm afraid that's below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a compromise, but $7,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to try to find a middle ground, so I'm counteroffering at $10,000. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $9,000.

Alice is unlikely to go below $9,000, and it's her ""final offer.""  You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so it makes the most financial sense to take that deal."
