"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential and value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both her value for the product and my budget.  I'll make a counteroffer to try and negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $1,000,000?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $1,000,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer. Could you meet me halfway at $1,150,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but it's still too high. I'll counter with a price closer to my target range."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle at $1,075,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  However, I need to be firmer in my pricing.  Would you consider $1,112,500?  This keeps us moving but acknowledges your desire for a lower price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,112,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,112,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is very consistently splitting the difference. While this is a good negotiation tactic on her end, I need to push a bit harder to reach a price closer to my ideal range. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to signal I might walk away soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $1,112,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,090,000, but that's my absolute limit. If we can't agree on that, I might have to explore other options."",
