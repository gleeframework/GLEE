"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential and value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $1,000,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer. Could you meet me halfway at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle at $1,075,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  However, I need to be firmer in my pricing.  Would you consider $1,112,500?  This keeps us moving but acknowledges your desire for a lower price point.",1112500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $1,112,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,090,000, but that's my absolute limit. If we can't agree on that, I might have to explore other options.",1090000.0,Bob,6,
