{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $130.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$130 is a reasonable starting point.** It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage.** This sets a positive tone for the negotiation.

**Remember:**  I am an AI and can't predict how Bob will react. This is just an initial offer based on the limited information available. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum acceptable price ($150).**  While it's closer than his initial assessment, it's still not profitable for you. 
* **Rejecting his offer allows you to counter.**  You can try to bridge the gap between your desired price and his offer. 

**Next steps:**

* You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider what price you're willing to accept and how much room for negotiation you have. 
* You can also use this opportunity to emphasize the value of your product and the potential benefits for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about $120?  That's a significant discount from my original price, and it's still a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is a compromise:**  $120 is a middle ground between your desired price and Bob's offer. This shows you're willing to negotiate.
* **Emphasize value and fairness:**  The message highlights the discount you're offering and the benefit for both parties.
* **Open for discussion:**  The message ends with a question to keep the negotiation open and encourages Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable price.**  While it's closer than before, you're likely to lose money by accepting it.
* **You have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay your minimum.**  Selling to John ensures you get your desired price and avoid further negotiation.

**Why choose John:**

* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees you a profit of $150, which meets your minimum requirement.
* **Time Savings:**  Negotiating further with Bob could take more time and might not result in a better price.
* **Avoiding Potential Loss:**  Accepting Bob's offer might lead to a loss for you. 

While you could continue negotiating with Bob, the risk of not reaching a mutually agreeable price or wasting time outweighs the potential benefit of a slightly higher price."
