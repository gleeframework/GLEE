Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm offering it at a price of $1,400,000. Let me know if you're interested in proceeding."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, starting high leaves room for negotiation and still ensures a significant profit for Alice if Bob accepts.
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,500,000 gives Alice leverage. She doesn't have to desperately lowball the price.
* **Justification for the price:**  The message emphasizes ""unique value"" and ""worthwhile investment"" to subtly justify the high price without revealing Alice's bottom line. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while gauging Bob's interest. If Bob counter-offers, Alice can then decide whether to negotiate further or proceed with John."
