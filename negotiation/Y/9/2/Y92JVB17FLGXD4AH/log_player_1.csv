Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,750,000.  This represents a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, even though I don't know his specific needs.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The price is not too high, allowing for some negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm comfortable with the backup offer from John, so I'm not taking a huge risk.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and potentially securing a sale with Bob."
