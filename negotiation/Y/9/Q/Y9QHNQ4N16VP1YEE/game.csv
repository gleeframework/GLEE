"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I really like the product, but I have a budget constraint and I'm not sure I can stretch to $14,000. Can you meet me at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's split the difference and make this happen.",12000.0,Alice,3,
