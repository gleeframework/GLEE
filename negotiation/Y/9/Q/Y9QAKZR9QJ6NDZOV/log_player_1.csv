Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
