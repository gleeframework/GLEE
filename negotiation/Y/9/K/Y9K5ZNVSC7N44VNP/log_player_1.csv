{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum desired price, but it still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in this deal and be willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. This is the maximum I am willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000 and even below the value the product has to him ($800,000).  I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I'll counter with a more reasonable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $900,000, so I'm offering $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd love to close a deal with Bob, his offer of $850,000 is still too low.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with an even lower offer. John is offering me my minimum desired price, and I can't afford to lose out on that opportunity."
