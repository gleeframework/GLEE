"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $16000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12000, which is my absolute maximum.  If that works for you, we have a deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but $12000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell it to you for $14000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase.",14000.0,Alice,5,
