"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product for $1,000,000.  It's a significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Let me know your thoughts, as I've got another interested party ready to buy at a lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and is using a bit of sales pressure by mentioning another interested party. By rejecting her initial offer, Bob might be able to get a better price closer to Alice's actual value of $800,000."
