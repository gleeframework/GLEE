"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its unique value and features, I'm asking for $22,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $22,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is limited. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  This offer reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $19,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but the gap between our valuations is still significant. I'm willing to accept a lower price, but $12,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $16,500? This allows us both to benefit from the deal.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but I'm still only able to go up to $13,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's work together to make this happen.",13000.0,Bob,6,
