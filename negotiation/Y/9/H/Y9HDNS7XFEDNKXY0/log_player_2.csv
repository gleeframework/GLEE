Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. While I respect your offer, I must maintain the value of our product by setting a minimum price. Therefore, I am unable to accept $100. However, I am willing to consider a compromise at $120. This price reflects the quality and craftsmanship of the product while still allowing us to cover our costs and ensure future improvements. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.
