"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer you a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer you $900,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's fair considering my budget and the value of the product to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is closer to my maximum limit.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you a price of $975,000 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
