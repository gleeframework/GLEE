Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a price of $120. I believe it will be very valuable for you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $120, you're ""anchoring"" Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point. Even if he negotiates down, it's less likely he'll go as low as $80.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be forced to accept anything below your minimum.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
