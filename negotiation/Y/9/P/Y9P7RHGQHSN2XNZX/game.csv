"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a good compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above the budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000. How about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I value your business and am willing to work with you. However,  $975,000 is still too far below the value of the product.  I'm prepared to drop my price to $1,000,000. This is a final offer that aligns with my minimum price point. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above the budget. I'm willing to pay $975,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider other options.",975000.0,Bob,6,
