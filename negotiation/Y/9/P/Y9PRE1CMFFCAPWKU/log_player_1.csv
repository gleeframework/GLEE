Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $2,250,000."", ""product_price"": 2250000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiations often benefit from starting with an ambitious offer. This anchors the negotiation at a higher point and leaves room for concessions.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer will help me gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. His response will reveal how much he values the product and how aggressively he's willing to negotiate.
* **Fallback Option:** I have a strong fallback position with John's offer of $1,500,000. This gives me leverage to walk away from a deal with Bob if it doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. It's clear we have a wide gap to bridge in this negotiation. I will counter-offer in the next round with a price closer to my target while still allowing room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, my original price takes into account the true value of this product. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,900,000."", ""product_price"": 1900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** I've made a substantial decrease from my initial offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming high to allow room for further adjustments. 
* **Signaling Value:** By holding firm above Bob's offer, I am reinforcing the idea that the product is worth significantly more than his initial valuation.
* **Maintaining Walk-Away Power:** I'm keeping my offer well above John's standing offer of $1,500,000, ensuring I have a profitable alternative if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still pretty far apart on price. I could potentially go up to $900,000, but that's my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased slightly, it remains significantly below my minimum acceptable price. His statement that $900,000 is his ""limit"" may be a negotiating tactic, and I'm not convinced he's reached his true maximum willingness to pay. However, his small concessions indicate that we might not be able to bridge the gap significantly. I will use my next counteroffer to test his resolve while keeping John's offer in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  While your offer is closer to my original thinking, I need to see a more significant step for us to reach a deal.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By stating this is my final offer, I am creating a sense of urgency and signaling my commitment to this price point. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** I've made a significant concession to show Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm holding firm above my guaranteed alternative with John ($1,500,000).
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** This offer will reveal whether Bob is genuinely interested in closing the deal or if he's unwilling to meet me closer to my valuation. 
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  I am prepared to walk away from the negotiation and accept John's offer if Bob does not accept this final price."
