Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  While your offer is closer to my original thinking, I need to see a more significant step for us to reach a deal.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and it's still significantly above your maximum price and your alternative option with John.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation if you are unwilling to meet her price. You can get the product for a much better price from John."
