"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $75 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. It's still a great price for a product that's worth $80 to you! Let me know if you're interested.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking to keep my costs down, so I would like to propose $80 as the final price for the product. This aligns closely with its value to me, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
