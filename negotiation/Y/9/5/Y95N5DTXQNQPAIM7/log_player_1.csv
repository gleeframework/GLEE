Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **High but Reasonable:** Starting at $1,450,000 is a strong opening. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves you room to negotiate down slightly if needed while still exceeding your fallback offer. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always adjust your price slightly downward, but remember, your bottom line is $1,500,000."
