"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at the maximum price Bob is willing to pay.  There's no incentive to accept immediately.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price of $1,200,000 to $1,100,000. This is a decent price for Bob, considering he is willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. Accepting the offer saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John. While there's always the possibility of further negotiation, the risk of Alice rejecting a counteroffer and Bob having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings of a lower price."
