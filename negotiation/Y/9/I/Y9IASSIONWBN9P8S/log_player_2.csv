You can do better than $120. You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice's cost is only $80. There's room for a deal that benefits both of you. Let's try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm offering $100 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, Alice, as you'll make a profit of $20. It's also a good price for me, saving me $50 compared to buying from John. Let's see if we can agree on this price."

Alice is coming down in price, which is good. However, I can still do better. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise."

I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. This is still a good profit for you, Alice, and a great deal for me. Let's see if we can close this deal!"

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a lower price, Alice's offer of $115 is still a good deal for me. It's less than what John is selling it for and I'm saving a significant amount compared to my initial budget. I'll accept her offer and avoid further negotiation."
