Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as much money from Bob as possible while ensuring he's likely to buy.
* **Appeal to Value:**  The message highlights ""special price"" and ""great deal"" to make Bob feel like he's getting an advantage.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  
    * $150 is too high, Bob won't buy it. 
    * $100 is giving it away, I can get more from John.
    * $125 is a compromise â€“ a significant profit if Bob accepts, and I still have John as a backup."
