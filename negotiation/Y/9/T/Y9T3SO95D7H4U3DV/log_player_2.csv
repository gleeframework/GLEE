"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can aim for a price closer to his $12,000 limit. Rejecting the offer allows for counter-offers and potentially a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is better than her previous one but still above Bob's ideal price.  Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate and has room to counter-offer again. It's unlikely that Alice will go much lower than $9000, but another counter-offer could be the final push to get closer to his target."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $8,750. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us, and it's the best I can do right now."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still looking for a bit of a discount, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9200, which is a bit closer to your target price. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value this product brings to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,200 is getting closer to Bob's desired price point. At this point, continuing to counter-offer could risk Alice walking away from the deal. Considering the price from John is significantly higher, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice for Bob to secure the product at a favorable price."
