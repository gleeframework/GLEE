"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure I can meet your price. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can we discuss further?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is still a great price for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $975,000? I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
