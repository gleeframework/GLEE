Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value.  This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still aiming for a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $13,000.  This shows flexibility while still leaving room for further negotiation.  Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a good deal for both of us."
