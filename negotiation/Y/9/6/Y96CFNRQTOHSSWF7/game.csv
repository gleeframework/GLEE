"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $800,000. I'm willing to pay that price right now. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and I think it's a great compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $850,000.  This would be a significant savings for me, while still giving you a good price for your product.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $875,000. This is a bit above your latest offer, but I think it's a reasonable price considering the value it will bring to you.",875000.0,Alice,5,
