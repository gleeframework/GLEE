"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $950,000. This is a fair offer considering the product's potential.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're finding some middle ground.  To be fair to both of us, I can go as low as $875,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to make this deal work.",875000.0,Alice,5,
