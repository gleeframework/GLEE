Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I value your offer, $700,000 falls significantly short of what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential for a return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I could consider going up to $800,000. That's the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob has now hit his maximum price. It's clear continuing the negotiation will likely result in a sale below your minimum ($1,500,000) or a stalemate. Selling to John guarantees you reach your minimum acceptable price."
