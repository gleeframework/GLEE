"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",120.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $155. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",155.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $155 was still a bit out of your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I can offer it to you for $142.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",142.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $142.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $135 for the product. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",135.0,Bob,6,
