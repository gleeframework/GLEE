Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more around $8500. Could you consider that?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $8,500 is still significantly less than my minimum value of $10,000, and I want to see if I can get closer to that with further negotiation."
