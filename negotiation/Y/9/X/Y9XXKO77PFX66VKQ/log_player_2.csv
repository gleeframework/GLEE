Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on $101 for the product? This seems like a fair compromise given our previous discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is clearly trying to meet in the middle, and getting the product for $101 is a good deal compared to John's $150 price.  Continuing to negotiate might frustrate Alice and doesn't offer a significant potential for savings."
