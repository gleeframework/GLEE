"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, we're confident it's worth more than $150 to you. Considering this, I'm offering you the chance to purchase it for $200. This price reflects not only its intrinsic value but also the opportunity to secure such a high-quality item at a reasonable premium. I look forward to hearing your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is too high. You're willing to pay $150 at most, and John is offering the product at that price.  There's no need to pay a premium ($200) when you can get it for less."
