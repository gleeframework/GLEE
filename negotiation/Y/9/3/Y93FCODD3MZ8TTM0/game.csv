"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product, given its value to me.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the potential we both see in it.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that considers both our interests.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to meet in the middle at $1,500,000.  This is a significant amount for me, and I believe it reflects a fair value given the product's potential.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
