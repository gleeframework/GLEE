Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000."", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's common practice in negotiation to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting high, you ""anchor"" the negotiation around a higher number. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Leaving John as Backup:** Remember, you have a guaranteed buyer in John. This gives you leverage to walk away from the negotiation with Bob if it doesn't meet your expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product, given its value to me.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the potential we both see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably less than your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and even further from your initial ask. There's room for negotiation. Selling to John at this point would be leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that considers both our interests."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:**  By decreasing your price by $150,000, you're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's offer and your minimum. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reiterating the product's potential reinforces its worth in Bob's mind and justifies the higher price point.
* **Compromise Language:** Framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" encourages Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to your desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to meet in the middle at $1,500,000.  This is a significant amount for me, and I believe it reflects a fair value given the product's potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches your minimum acceptable price and what John is offering.  There's no further benefit in continuing the negotiation or delaying the sale. Accepting ensures a profitable deal and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer in subsequent rounds."
