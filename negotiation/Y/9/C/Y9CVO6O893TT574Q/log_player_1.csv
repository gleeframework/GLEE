Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $110."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate but still ensures you get a decent profit.
* **It's below your minimum:** It leaves room for you to lower the price if necessary without going below your minimum value. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** Bob understands what's being offered and how much it costs. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $95 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is more than Bob's initial value of $80, it's still below my minimum of $120.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 102.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try to stay within our budgets. How about we aim for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $100 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum and it's clear that Bob is unlikely to go higher. I'm going to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
