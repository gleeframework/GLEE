You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your preferred maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as you can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations fail."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering $900,000, which is still above your preferred maximum. While you could continue negotiating, it's getting close to your budget and there's no guarantee you'll get a better price. Since John is offering the product for $800,000, it's the most financially sensible option at this point."
