"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $800,000 is a decent price, there's a good chance I can negotiate a better deal.  I have plenty of rounds left and I'm willing to try to get closer to a price I'm happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree the product has great potential, but $800,000 is a little steep for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $650,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I've made a significant counteroffer, aiming to bring the price down by $150,000. This starting point leaves room for further negotiation while still being a reasonable jump from my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll offer the product to you for $725,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving in the right direction, but $725,000 is still too high. I'm willing to push a little further and see if I can get her closer to the $700,000 mark.  I'm comfortable rejecting this offer for now, as I have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the counter-offer. I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference again and settle at $687,500? I'm serious about buying this product, and I think this price is a win-win for both of us."",
""product_price"": 687500
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm continuing to negotiate by splitting the difference, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise but also holding firm on getting a good deal. This keeps the negotiation moving while slowly bringing the price down towards my target range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $687,500. I'll offer the product to you for $700,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $700,000 is now within a reasonable range of my target price. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might not budge much more. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price without dragging out the negotiation and potentially losing the opportunity."
