Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree the product has great potential, but $800,000 is a little steep for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $650,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
