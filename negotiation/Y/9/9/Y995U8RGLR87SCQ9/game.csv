"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree the product has great potential, but $800,000 is a little steep for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $650,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll offer the product to you for $725,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know what you think!",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the counter-offer. I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference again and settle at $687,500? I'm serious about buying this product, and I think this price is a win-win for both of us.",687500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $687,500.
