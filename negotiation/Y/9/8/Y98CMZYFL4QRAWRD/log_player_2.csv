Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $13,000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your thinking, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I can do $12,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $12,500. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $12,000, securing the best possible price."
