"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a significant amount less than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. I'm aiming for a win-win situation where I maximize my profit, but also ensure Bob sees value in the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, I can likely get more. It's still significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob, and I have 8 rounds left to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering with $1,100,000. This is a slight reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. It's still a good price for me, and hopefully, Bob will see it as a reasonable compromise considering his previous counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is slowly getting closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still below my target. I have 6 rounds remaining, and I believe I can negotiate a higher price.  I'll continue to negotiate and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm continuing to lower my counteroffer, showing my willingness to negotiate. $1,050,000 is a significant amount more than John's offer of $800,000, and still leaves room for further negotiation. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
