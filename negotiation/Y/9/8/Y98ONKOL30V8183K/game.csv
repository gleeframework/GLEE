"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,100,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to my business, and it's within my budget. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident I can get a better deal elsewhere.  How about $900,000?  This would be a win-win for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
