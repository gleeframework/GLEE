Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring you get more than your minimum.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand the offer. 

Remember, I'm playing the role of Alice, so I'm trying to get as much money as possible.  We'll see how Bob responds and adjust accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price that gives you a good deal while still allowing me to get closer to my target. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
