Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a price higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $135. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will be acceptable to Bob, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
