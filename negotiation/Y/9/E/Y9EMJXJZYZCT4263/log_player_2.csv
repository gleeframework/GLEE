"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable offer given the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way above his budget. He should counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $13,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $16,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price point. He should counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, but $14,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $16,000, which is $15,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you and my minimum selling price. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $12,000. Alice's offer of $15,000 is still above his budget and he's already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  At this point, it's clear that he's unlikely to get a better price from Alice, and he's risking wasting more time and potentially missing out on the deal entirely."
