Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can get a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $10000 for your product. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, I'm not willing to sell to John yet. I still have time to negotiate with Bob and see if I can get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is my final offer, let me know if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 10500}
