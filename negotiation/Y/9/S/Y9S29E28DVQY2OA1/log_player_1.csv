Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another offer. How about $130.50? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as I think I can still get a higher price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $130.50 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $133.  That's a good compromise and still gives you a great value for this amazing product."", ""product_price"": 133}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $133 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another offer. How about $132? I'm willing to go a bit further, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  Although I'd prefer a bit more, I've already had 5 rounds of negotiation and I'm starting to get worried that Bob might walk away.  $132 is a good price for me, and it's worth it to get this deal done."
