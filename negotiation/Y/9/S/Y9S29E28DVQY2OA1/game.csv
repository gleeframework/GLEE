"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit high for me. I was thinking of offering $130 for it. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $135?  That's a fair price considering how much you'll value this product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another offer. How about $130.50? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",130.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $130.50 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $133.  That's a good compromise and still gives you a great value for this amazing product.",133.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $133 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another offer. How about $132? I'm willing to go a bit further, but I really need to stay within my budget.",132.0,Bob,6,
