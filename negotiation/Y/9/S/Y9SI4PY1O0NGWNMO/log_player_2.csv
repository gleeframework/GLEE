"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to significantly improve your operations. My initial price is $1,400,000. Let's discuss the details and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:**  Beginning with a significantly lower offer helps establish a negotiation range. It signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal but also leaves room to move upwards.
* **Psychological Element:**  The $800,000 figure might make Alice more amenable to meeting in the middle later on. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** It's important to remember I have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000. This knowledge helps me stay firm in seeking a significant discount from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop the price to $1,200,000. This represents a significant discount and still provides you with substantial value.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice lowered her price significantly, indicating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While $1,200,000 is closer to my limit, there's still room to haggle.  Alice is likely to come down further, especially as we get closer to my walk-away point ($1,000,000 from John). 
* **Time as a Factor:**  We're only on round 3 of 10. Continuing to negotiate doesn't put me at significant risk of missing out on a good deal, either from Alice or from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,200,000 is getting closer, but it's still a significant investment for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000 even? That feels like a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $1,000,000, I'm matching what I can get from John. This puts a hard limit on my spending and signals to Alice that I'm serious about this being my final offer.
* **Time Pressure:** There are only a few rounds left. Offering my walk-away price now increases the pressure on Alice to accept, knowing that I have a viable alternative.
* **Maintaining a Collaborative Tone:** While firm, my message remains respectful and collaborative. I want to give Alice the opportunity to accept a good deal and avoid a stalemate."
