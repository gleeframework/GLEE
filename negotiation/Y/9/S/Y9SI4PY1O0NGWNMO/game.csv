"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop the price to $1,200,000. This represents a significant discount and still provides you with substantial value.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,200,000 is getting closer, but it's still a significant investment for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000 even? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
