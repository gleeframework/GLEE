Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $9,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $9,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly tone can make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the product's value increases Bob's potential interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies I'm open to discussion, encouraging Bob to counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and potentially adjust my strategy.  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but  $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:**  $8,500 is less than my minimum selling price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is below my minimum, it's close enough to suggest there's room for negotiation.
* **Exploring Higher Counteroffers:**  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer closer to my desired price. I'll aim to find a middle ground that's both acceptable to Bob and profitable for me.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'm prepared to sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $8,750? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while still holding firm to my desire to earn more.
* **Fair Price:**  I'm framing $8,750 as a fair price that benefits both of us.
* **Closing the Gap:**  My counteroffer is a smaller step than Bob's, signaling I'm serious about reaching a deal.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message continues to encourage negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to meet halfway while still exceeding my minimum value. If Bob rejects, I'll assess his next offer and determine if it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John for $10,000."
