Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but  $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $8,750? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
You should accept Alice's offer.  While you can get the product for $8,000 from John, there's a chance that Alice might not accept your counteroffer and you might end up paying $8,000 anyway. You're saving $250 by accepting Alice's offer."
