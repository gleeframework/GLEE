"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000? This still leaves you with a significant profit margin while allowing me to get closer to my target price.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to a price point where I'm comfortable. How about we settle at $890,000?",890000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  While $890,000 is tempting, I need to be closer to my asking price to make this deal work for me.  Let's compromise again and settle at $905,000.  I believe this price still offers you a substantial return on your investment.",905000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $897,000. This represents a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?",897000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're almost there!  I'm ready to make a final concession. I'll accept $900,000 for the product.  This price point allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,7,
