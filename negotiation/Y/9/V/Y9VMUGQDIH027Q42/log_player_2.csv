Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're almost there!  I'm ready to make a final concession. I'll accept $900,000 for the product.  This price point allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.  What do you say?

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **We've reached a good price:** $900,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,200,000.
* **Alice seems firm:**  Her language suggests this is her final offer. Pushing further might make her less willing to negotiate.
* **Limited rounds:** We only have a few rounds left. Continuing to negotiate might lead to not reaching a deal with Alice and having to accept John's less favorable offer."
