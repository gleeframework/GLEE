"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $700000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $750000 for it. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,
