Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,000,000 and $1,500,000.

**The Strategy**

The key is to propose a price that's attractive to Bob (meaning it's below his perceived value) while still maximizing your profit. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $1,250,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:** The message is clear and enthusiastic about the product's value to Bob.
* **Strong Price Point:** $1,250,000 gives you a significant profit over your minimum while still being well below Bob's maximum.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  The ""limited-time offer"" adds a touch of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher.
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, a more moderate approach might be better. 
* **Information is Key:** In real negotiations, gathering more information about Bob's needs and constraints would be essential for optimizing your offer."
