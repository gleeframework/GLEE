"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. It's important to negotiate to try and get a price closer to your maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation while staying well below my $120 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is too low for me. Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $130 is still above your maximum budget and John's offer. It's worth negotiating a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to stay closer to $100. How about $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

This counter-offer splits the difference between my previous offer and Alice's current offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below my maximum budget."
