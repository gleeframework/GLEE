Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Leaving Room for Bob:**  While we know Bob values the product at $80, there's a chance he might be willing to go a bit higher.  Offering at $120 gives him room to negotiate without feeling insulted. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you have John as a backup buyer at $100.  This gives you leverage to walk away if Bob's offers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer of $90 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* You have the option to sell to John for $100, so accepting $90 would be a loss.
* By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and open the door for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm eager to make a deal, $90 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By countering with $110, we're moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above our minimum. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** We haven't dropped to John's offer of $100, keeping it as a viable alternative if negotiations with Bob don't pan out.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will give us more information about Bob's flexibility and how much he truly values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer has increased, but it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him not reaching your desired price.
* You have a guaranteed offer from John for $100. It makes the most financial sense to take the sure profit rather than risk getting a lower amount from Bob."
