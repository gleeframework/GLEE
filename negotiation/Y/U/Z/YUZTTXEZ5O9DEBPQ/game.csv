"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,500 is still a little high for me. I'm prepared to pay $11,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $11,250. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $11,250 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a slight adjustment. How about we split the difference at $11,125? This would make a deal possible and keep both of us happy.  Let me know what you think.",11125.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,125. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $11,300. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.
