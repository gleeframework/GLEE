"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still giving me a profit.  I'll see if he's willing to bite at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'll try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a bit of a compromise, but it still allows me to make a decent profit. Hopefully, Bob will find this more appealing than my original offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'll see if I can get him to budge closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500, which is only $500 above my minimum. I'm hoping that this is enough to entice Bob to finally accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where Bob is not willing to meet me halfway. I've already had to lower my price twice, and with only a few rounds left, it's likely I won't be able to get a better offer from him. I'm going to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John and avoid the risk of getting stuck with an even lower price."
