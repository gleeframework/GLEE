{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's always a good idea to try and negotiate with Alice first, as you might be able to get a better price.  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to see if you can get closer to your $8,000 goal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,500. This is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but still a bit above my ideal price. I'm hoping Alice will be willing to negotiate from here."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $9,000 is closer to my goal, but I'm still not satisfied. I'll reject and try to counteroffer again. I have 7 rounds left, so there's still time to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}

I'm going to increase my counteroffer slightly to $8,750. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but I'm still pushing for a price closer to my target."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $8,800 is very close to my target price.  Since I only have 5 rounds left, I'm going to accept this offer. It's a good compromise and I'm likely to get a better deal than buying from John."
