"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $85 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get it even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70} 
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $15. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal, but it's still within a reasonable range. If she rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer. While I'd prefer a lower price,  $80 is still within my budget and a good deal compared to John's price. I don't want to risk going further and losing the opportunity with Alice."
