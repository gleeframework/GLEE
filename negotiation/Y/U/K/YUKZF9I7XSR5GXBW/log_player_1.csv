{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm setting the price at $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, securing a deal with Bob above his perceived value ($1,000,000) is crucial for maximizing profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") and positions it as a potential bargain for Bob, who stands to gain a significant asset for less than Alice values it.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters. This allows Alice to potentially secure an even better deal."
