"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiations at a price of $1,000,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a significant concession from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  To be honest, $950,000 is a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $875,000? That would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $875,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession and propose a counteroffer of $925,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm and even stated this is her final offer.  While we could push further, there's a risk she walks away.  Getting the product for $925,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,200,000 price. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it."
