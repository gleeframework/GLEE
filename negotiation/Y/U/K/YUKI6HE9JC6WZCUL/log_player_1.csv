Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiations at a price of $1,000,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm hoping to purchase it at a slightly lower price. Would you be willing to consider $800,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000.

This is a significant concession from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  To be honest, $950,000 is a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $875,000? That would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.
