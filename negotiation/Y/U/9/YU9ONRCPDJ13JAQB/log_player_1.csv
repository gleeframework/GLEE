"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($10,000). This allows for negotiation room and potentially a better outcome.
* **No Information:** I have no information about Bob's willingness to pay, so a high initial offer helps to gauge his interest and potential budget. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** The option to sell to John for $10,000 provides a guaranteed floor, so I'm not overly risky with my negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested.  There's room for negotiation.
* **John is Still Available:** I can still sell to John for $10,000, so I'm not under immediate pressure to accept a low offer.  

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my initial offer but still staying above my minimum acceptable value. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Room for Further Negotiation:** There's still room for a bit more compromise if Bob's budget is closer to $6,000, but this offer is a reasonable midpoint between my initial price and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Maintaining Value:** This offer allows for a good profit margin and keeps the deal above my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is close to my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I would prefer a higher price, there is a chance that Bob will not increase his offer in the next round, and I may end up selling to John for $10,000. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it is risky to continue negotiating.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit.

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of a failed negotiation and secures a decent profit."
