The product is worth no more than $12,000 to you, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It's better to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $10,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let's see if she's willing to negotiate."

While $13,000 is closer to my limit, it's still above my ideal price.  I'll reject the offer and see if I can get closer to $12,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but $12,800 is still too high. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get her to come down even further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm making a final counteroffer of $12,000.  This is my absolute limit, and I'm hoping Alice will accept. If she doesn't, I'll go with John's offer."
