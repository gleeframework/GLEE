Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob to see if I can get a better deal. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin.
* **Respectful Tone:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and inviting Bob to consider the offer.

This strategy allows me to test Bob's willingness to pay a premium while still having the safety net of John's offer."
