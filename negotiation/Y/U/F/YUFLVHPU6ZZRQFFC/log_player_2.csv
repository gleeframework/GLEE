"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $11,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal target of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price.  There are also 9 more rounds, so there's plenty of time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  This is a fair price given the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is below its value to me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. While $11,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal target of $10,000. There are still 7 rounds left, so Bob has time to continue negotiating and try to reach a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions.  Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still looking for a price closer to $11,000. Would you consider $10,900? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer of $10,900 is very close to Bob's ideal target of $10,000. It's a significant improvement from previous rounds.
* **Time is Running Out:** There are only 5 rounds left, and the risk of buying from John at $12,000 is getting higher.
* **Potential Compromise:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't budge much lower. Accepting the offer secures a good deal within Bob's budget."
