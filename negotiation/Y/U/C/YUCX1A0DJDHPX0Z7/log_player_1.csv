{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $90 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while also keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

The product is worth $80 to you and Bob's offer is lower. You can get a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $85 is a bit too high. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $82.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $82.50 is a good deal. It's higher than what you would get from John and it's closer to your ideal price. It's worth accepting this offer and closing the deal."
