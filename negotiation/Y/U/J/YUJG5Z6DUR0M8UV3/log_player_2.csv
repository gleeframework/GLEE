"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $11,500
* **John's price:** $12,000
* **Your maximum budget:** $12,000

Since Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget, it's best to reject her offer and buy from John for a slightly higher price. This still allows you to stay within your budget and save $500 compared to accepting Alice's offer."
