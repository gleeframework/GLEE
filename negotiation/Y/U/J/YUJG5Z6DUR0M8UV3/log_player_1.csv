""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still keeping Alice well above her minimum.
* **Time Value:** Offering it to Bob first at a premium price acknowledges the potential speed of the deal, as opposed to waiting for John's guaranteed but lower offer."
