"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $135 for it. Let me know what you think.",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $165. Let me know if that works for you.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $165 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $145.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with John's offer.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $157.50. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. Let me know if that works for you.",157.5,Alice,5,
