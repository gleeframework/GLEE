# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle, but that's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we try $7,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that. However, $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair price for the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down in price, but she's still above your maximum budget. It's unlikely she'll go as low as $8,000.  You have the option to buy from John at your target price, so it's time to cut your losses with Alice and take the guaranteed deal."
