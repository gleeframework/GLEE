"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle, but that's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we try $7,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that. However, $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair price for the value the product brings to your business.",8500.0,Alice,5,
