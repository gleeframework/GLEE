**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. He's set a ""final offer"" that's still considerably lower than both your initial asking price and John's guaranteed offer. Waiting for Bob to potentially (and improbably) reach a more agreeable price isn't worth the risk of losing the $1,200,000 from John."
