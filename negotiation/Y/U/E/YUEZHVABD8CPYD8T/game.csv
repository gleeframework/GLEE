"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $160? That would still be a fair price for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I understand that $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $140? That's the highest I'm willing to go.,140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a little bit more. I'm willing to come down to $145.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $145 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $135. That's the best I can do.",135.0,Bob,6,
