Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $65?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While $75 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
