Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I open it up to other potential buyers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay the full $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob quickly avoids potential delays or complications.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other potential buyers creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously.

This strategy aims to secure a price closer to our desired outcome while leaving room for potential counter-offers from Bob."
