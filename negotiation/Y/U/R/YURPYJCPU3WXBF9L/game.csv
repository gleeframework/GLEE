"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the investment for you. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $6,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8,500?  This price still reflects the value of the product and would be a fair deal for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,500?  That would make it much easier for me to say yes.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $7,500 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $8,000. This is a good compromise for both of us, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",8000.0,Alice,5,
