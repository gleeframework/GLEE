Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $6,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8,500?  This price still reflects the value of the product and would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,500?  That would make it much easier for me to say yes.
