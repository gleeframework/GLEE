You can do better than $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

I'm offering $9,000.  This is still a good deal for Alice, as she values the product at $15,000.  This price is also closer to my budget, and leaves room for further negotiation."

$11,500 is still too high.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before I go with John."

I'm offering $10,000. This is a fair price that's closer to my budget and still gives Alice a significant profit.  If she rejects this, I'm going to buy from John."

Alice is not budging on her price, and I've already made my best counteroffer.  It's time to move on and buy the product from John.  $8,000 is the best price I can get, and I don't want to risk getting stuck in a long negotiation with Alice."
