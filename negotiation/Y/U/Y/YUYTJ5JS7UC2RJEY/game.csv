"I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. It's a bit higher than what it's worth to you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference and settle on $110? I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try to get closer to the value you mentioned earlier? Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90?,90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $90 is simply too low for me. How about $105? That's closer to your offer and still gives me a decent profit. Let's make this deal happen!",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm not willing to go above $100. I think that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. Would you be willing to meet me at $100?,100.0,Bob,6,
