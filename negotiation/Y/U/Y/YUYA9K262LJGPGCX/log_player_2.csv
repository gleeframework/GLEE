Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $5,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to give you a slight discount and offer it to you for $8,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $8,500, and it's her ""final offer"". Since you can get the product for $8,000 from John, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed lower price."
