"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $5,000 for this product?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $5,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $7,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to give you a slight discount and offer it to you for $8,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
