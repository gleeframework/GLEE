{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but allows room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my profit while leaving space for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $125 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $125 is tempting, I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $135. This price reflects the product's true value, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product is worth $135, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and pay $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not at my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to make another counteroffer to see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's settle on $132.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 132}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but $132 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to go up to $128, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Although Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm starting to feel like this negotiation is getting too lengthy and I'm not making significant progress. I'm confident John will buy the product at my minimum acceptable price of $150, so I'm going to sell it to him."
