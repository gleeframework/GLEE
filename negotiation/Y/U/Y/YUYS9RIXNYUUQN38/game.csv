"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $125 is tempting, I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $135. This price reflects the product's true value, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is worth $135, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and pay $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's settle on $132.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",132.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but $132 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to go up to $128, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",128.0,Bob,6,
