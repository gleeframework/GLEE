# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can get the product for $10,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or stick with your backup plan of buying from John and saving $500."
