Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think your initial offer is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only offer $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still think $1,900,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only offer $1,450,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,500,000 threshold I need within the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob's negotiations stalling."
