"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that I believe is worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'd be happy with it. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great price, considering the value you'll get from it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $15,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can negotiate for a lower price or proceed with buying from John to maximize your savings."
