"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can get the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $100 for it. Let me know if this is possible.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $100 is a bit too low for me. How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still find it a great value.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I hear you, but $105 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $107.50? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",107.5,Alice,5,

This is my best offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. Let me know what you think.",108.0,Alice,7,
