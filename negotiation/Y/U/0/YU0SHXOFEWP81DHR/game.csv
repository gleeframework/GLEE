,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This is my maximum offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget limitations. However, my initial offer reflects the true value of this product and the potential ROI it offers. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,200,000. I believe this price is fair considering my needs and the product's potential.  Let's find a way to bridge this gap.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but we need to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000, but that's my final concession.  This offer reflects the true value of the product and ensures a win-win scenario.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,600,000 is still too much for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This shows my serious interest in the product, and I believe it's a fair price considering our current positions.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer.  To be frank, selling at your price point would be difficult for me.  I can come down to $1,500,000.  This is my absolute lowest price, as it's the same amount another buyer is offering.  I believe this offer recognizes the product's value while being fair to both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
