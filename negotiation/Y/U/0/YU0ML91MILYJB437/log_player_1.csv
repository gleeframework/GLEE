I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to get a feel for Bob's interest level and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to settle for such a drastic discount.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $15,000. This is still above my minimum, but a compromise from my initial offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum price. However, the negotiation has been lengthy, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach an agreement.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'll sell to John to ensure a quick and certain sale."
