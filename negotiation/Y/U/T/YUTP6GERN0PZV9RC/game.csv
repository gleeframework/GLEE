"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $8,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
