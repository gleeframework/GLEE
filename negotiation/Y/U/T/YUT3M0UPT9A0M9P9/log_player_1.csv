"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to come down in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm offering $16,000, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to $15,000. I'm running out of rounds, but I'm determined to get as close to my target as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to offer $14,500. It's a significant increase from Bob's last offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get as close to my target as possible, but I also don't want to risk losing Bob's interest. With only 5 rounds left, the pressure is on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, I'm not confident I can get Bob to agree to a price closer to my minimum.  To ensure I get the best possible price, I'm going to sell to John for $15,000."
