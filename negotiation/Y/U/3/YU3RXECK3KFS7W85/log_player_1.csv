{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message to build rapport and a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This allows for some negotiation while still ensuring a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105? It's still a great deal for you, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 105}
