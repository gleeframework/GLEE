Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe its value is significant, but I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values it at $10,000, Alice needs to offer a price that's attractive but leaves room for profit.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  The guaranteed sale to John for $12,000 provides a strong fallback position.

**The Offer:** $11,500 is a strong starting point. It gives Bob a potential ""deal"" feeling (saving $500 from his perceived value) while netting Alice a significant profit over her minimum."
