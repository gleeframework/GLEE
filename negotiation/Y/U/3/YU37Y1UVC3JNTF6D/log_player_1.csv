Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, reflecting the value I see in the product and a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in the product, $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,262,500. This feels like a fair compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,262,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,262,500

``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we are still significantly above our minimum acceptable price. We are willing to negotiate, but we need to guide Bob closer to a figure that reflects the product's value. We will counter in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $1,300,000."
