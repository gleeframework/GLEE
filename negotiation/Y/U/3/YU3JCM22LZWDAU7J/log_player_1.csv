"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than my initial asking price. I believe I can get closer to my desired value if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still higher than Bob's counteroffer. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's fair to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $125. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm confident that $125 is a good deal. This is a fair price for both of us and it's worth closing the deal."
