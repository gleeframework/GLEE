"Alice, $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $18,000 is still too far off.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? ",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $11,000. If we can't find common ground at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Bob,4,
