"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start negotiations.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is far above your budget of $10,000. It's best to reject and counteroffer to start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $18,000 is still too far off.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still above my budget. While it's closer to my limit, I can still try to negotiate further. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $11,000. If we can't find common ground at that price, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 11000}
