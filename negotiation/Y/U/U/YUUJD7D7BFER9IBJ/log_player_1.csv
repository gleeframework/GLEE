"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I'll see how Bob responds before making any further adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if he'll come up a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's, and I'm hoping it's attractive enough for him to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is close enough to my counteroffer of $135 and above my minimum price of $120. I'm going to accept his offer to avoid further negotiation."
