Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if needed."", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations above your desired outcome to leave room for bargaining. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $14,000 allows for potential counteroffers from Bob while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer helps you understand how eager Bob is to purchase and how much negotiating power you might have."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'd be willing to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is above his perceived value of $10,000, indicating room for negotiation. 
* **Below Your Minimum:** Accepting $11,000 would be selling yourself short, as you value the product at a minimum of $12,000.
* **John as Backup:** Having a guaranteed offer from John at $12,000 provides a safety net, allowing you to confidently negotiate for a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I value your offer, $11,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Could you do $13,000?  That would make it worthwhile for me."", ""product_price"": 13000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer aims to split the difference between your initial offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($11,000). 
* **Still Above Your Minimum:** This price point maintains a profit margin above your $12,000 minimum.
* **Encouraging a Deal:** By showing a willingness to negotiate, you encourage Bob to continue the conversation and potentially reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a bit more, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. Can we agree on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meets Your Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 aligns with your minimum acceptable price, ensuring you don't incur a loss.
* **Avoids Further Risk:** While you might be able to push for a slightly higher price, there's a chance Bob could walk away or the negotiations could drag on. Accepting now secures a sure profit.
* **John's Offer is Equal:** Since John is also offering $12,000, there's no financial benefit to delaying the sale. Accepting Bob's offer allows you to close the deal quickly."
