I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a fair price, as it is more than my minimum acceptable price of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be willing to pay this price, as it is less than the value he places on the product ($120)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
