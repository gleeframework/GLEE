Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with my minimum price, as I know I can always sell to John for $120.  This gives Bob the opportunity to negotiate, but also establishes my firm bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum but still below it. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $115. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a price closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's likely he won't go any higher.  I'll accept his offer to avoid further negotiation."
