"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial to you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is too low for me to consider.  Could you do $1,050,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, so I'll offer $975,000. Can you consider this price?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that. While $975,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $1,020,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a fair deal, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,020,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but no higher. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to pay more than that.",980000.0,Bob,6,
