"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. Therefore, it's logical to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds interesting, but your price is too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This is my best offer, as I'm looking to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $950000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value goes beyond its price tag. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to get the deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  While it's a step in the right direction, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially getting closer to Bob's desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your maximum budget. I'm willing to meet you at $800000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a comprehensive support package and a 6-month warranty, which will give you added value and peace of mind. I'm still at $800000, but I believe the extras make it a more attractive offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has finally come down to Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. Even though Bob could buy the product from John for the same price, Alice is offering additional benefits, including a support package and a 6-month warranty. These extras add value to the deal and make it more attractive than simply buying from John. It's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and secure the product with these additional benefits."
