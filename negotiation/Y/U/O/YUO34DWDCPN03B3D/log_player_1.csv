Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiating.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $11,000, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Showing Willingness:** I emphasize that I'm open to negotiation, which makes me seem more flexible and less likely to walk away.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm not just stating a price, I'm suggesting that the product has value for Bob. 

This approach is designed to start the negotiation in a way that's likely to lead to a successful outcome for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it does signal that he's interested in the product. This gives me an opportunity to negotiate further.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  If negotiations with Bob fall through, I can still get my minimum price by selling to John.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,000 is below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This would still allow me to cover my costs and give you a fair price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by coming down from $11,000 to $9,500. This shows flexibility without giving away too much.
* **Reiterate value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to him, implying that $9,500 is still a good deal.
* **Open for further negotiation:** I leave the door open for further negotiation by using a question at the end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that we'll get stuck in a back-and-forth negotiation. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While $9,000 isn't ideal, selling to Bob now means I don't have to wait for further negotiations or risk selling to John for a lower price. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic choice at this point. It secures a good price for me while minimizing the risk of further negotiation delays."
