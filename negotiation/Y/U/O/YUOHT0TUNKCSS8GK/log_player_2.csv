"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. My initial offer is $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price. You have a strong position because you have a fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still above your maximum budget.  You're better off continuing to negotiate with Alice, hoping to push the price down even further. Remember, you have a safe haven with John if negotiations break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,050,000. That's a good step. However, it's still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm prepared to pay $950,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I have another option available at $800,000. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I can see that you're trying to get it for a steal, but I'm not going to let it go for that price. My next offer is $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm starting to think that I should just consider selling it to John at the higher price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now trying to push you towards John's offer. She's suggesting she might just sell to John instead, which is a tactic to pressure you.  It's clear that further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield a price lower than $1,000,000. Since you're comfortable with John's $800,000 offer, it's time to take the safe option and buy from John."
