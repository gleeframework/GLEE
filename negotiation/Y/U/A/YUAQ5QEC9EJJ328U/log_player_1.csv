"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and it's more than fair for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal selling price than John's offer. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but also allows me to maximize my potential earnings.  I'm also trying to build rapport with Bob by framing the deal as mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price.  I'm confident that I can find a compromise with Bob that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum price.  I'm also trying to re-emphasize the ""good deal"" aspect for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? That way, I can get a good deal, and you can still make a profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer more, $105 is a good compromise and still significantly better than selling to John. We're nearing the middle of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by being too stubborn."
