Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're at an impasse. I'm really not comfortable going below $10,000. It's my absolute minimum.  If you're serious about getting this product, I'm willing to stick with that number.  Otherwise, I may need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is signaling that $10,000 is her absolute bottom line. While you could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a real risk that she'll walk away from the negotiation. It's better to secure the deal at $10,000, saving $5,000 compared to John's offer, rather than risk losing the opportunity and having to pay the full $15,000."
