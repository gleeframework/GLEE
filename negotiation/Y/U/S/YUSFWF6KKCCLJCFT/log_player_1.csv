Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but lower than your minimum acceptable price of $120. This leaves room for negotiation while still allowing you to potentially secure a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is better than Bob's initial assessment, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

This counteroffer represents a compromise. It's lower than your initial offer of $110, but still higher than Bob's offer of $95. This shows a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a price closer to your desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $90 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $120.  At this point, continuing the negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to lead to a price you're comfortable with.  Selling to John guarantees you your minimum price and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
