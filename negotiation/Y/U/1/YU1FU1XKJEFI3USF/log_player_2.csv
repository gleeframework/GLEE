"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and we're looking to sell it at $95. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $95 is better than John's price of $120, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. I'd like to offer you the product at $90, which is higher than my previous offer. I hope this meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous one, it's still above Bob's desired price. He's willing to pay up to $85, so there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to counter and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $90 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm still only able to go up to $85.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to meet you halfway and offer the product at $87.50. This is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product and my cost. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $87.50 is a fair compromise and falls within Bob's maximum budget of $120.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject his next counteroffer and he might end up buying from John for a higher price. It's more strategic to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
