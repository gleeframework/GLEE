Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the return on your investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $15,000,  which is higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and potential return on investment to pique Bob's interest.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By suggesting it's a ""significant investment,"" I'm preparing Bob for the possibility of a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  See if he's even willing to consider the product at a high price point.
* **Set the Bar:**  Establish a strong initial position for negotiation.
* **Maintain Flexibility:**  Leave room to lower the price if necessary without sacrificing too much profit.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and either accept it, make a counteroffer, or end the negotiation and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $15000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I could counteroffer, there's no guarantee of a better deal. John is already offering my minimum, making him a safe and guaranteed option.

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing negotiation with Bob carries the risk of a lengthy process with no guarantee of a better outcome.
* **Time Value:**  I've already received a fair offer, and there's no guarantee Bob will be willing to go higher.
* **Certainty:** John offers a known, secure sale.

**Conclusion:**

Selling to John is the most prudent decision, as it offers immediate certainty and avoids the potential for a drawn-out, uncertain negotiation with Bob."
