Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($12,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.  
* **Backup Offer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so there's no pressure to accept a lowball offer from Bob. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring the product is sold."
