Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I start with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $115 offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting in the middle for a price that's still very beneficial for me.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware I can sell to John for $100, acting as a safety net. This knowledge allows me to be firmer in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is a decent offer, I know Bob values the product at $120. I'm willing to negotiate but not surrender most of the profit margin.  By rejecting, I signal that I'm looking for a better deal while keeping the negotiation alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer aims for a classic negotiation tactic â€“ finding a middle ground. It shows willingness to compromise but still targets a price significantly above my minimum.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  $110 is still a profitable price for me, and it avoids drastically undercutting my initial offer. It keeps the power dynamic relatively balanced. 
* **John Option in Mind:**  I remain aware of my alternative option (selling to John for $100), giving me a solid fallback if Bob continues to push for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice.  How about $108?  That's a decent compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Enough Deal:** $108 is only $2 less than my previous offer and represents a $8 profit over my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely Bob will move much higher.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiation takes time and effort. Accepting now secures the sale and avoids the risk of Bob walking away.
* **John Option as Leverage:**  While I could go to John, the difference between Bob's offer and John's offer is now small enough that it's not worth the risk of restarting the process."
