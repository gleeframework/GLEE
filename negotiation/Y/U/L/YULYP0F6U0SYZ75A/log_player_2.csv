"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000.  Let me know if you're interested! If not, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to create a sense of urgency with the mention of another buyer. This suggests she might be willing to negotiate.
* You have a better alternative in John, who is offering the product at your maximum budget of $15,000. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you give yourself a chance to negotiate a lower price, closer to her value of $12,000.

**It's important to note:**  There's a risk Alice might not negotiate further and sell to the other buyer. However, the potential savings of getting the product below $14,000 makes the risk worthwhile in this scenario."
