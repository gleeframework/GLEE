"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than the $8,000 value she places on it. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better price and might motivate her to come down closer to her own valuation."
