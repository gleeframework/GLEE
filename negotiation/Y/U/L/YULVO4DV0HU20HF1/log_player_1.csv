"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $15,000. I believe it's a great deal, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but my budget allows me to only spend up to $10000 on this product. Would it be possible to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my ideal price, it's still above my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the following rounds.  Selling to John right now would mean leaving some potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your budget, $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This would still give you a good deal and allow me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $12000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with our negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to sell for more, accepting this offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might result in a lower price or even a failed sale. Since I'm comfortable with this price and the risk of losing the deal is high, accepting the offer is the best course of action."
