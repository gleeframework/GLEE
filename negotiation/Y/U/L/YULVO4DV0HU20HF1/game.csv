"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but my budget allows me to only spend up to $10000 on this product. Would it be possible to negotiate down to that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your budget, $10000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13000. This would still give you a good deal and allow me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
