Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum value of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  Here's my reasoning:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  I want to earn as much as possible. A higher starting price gives me more leverage in potential negotiations.
* **Unknown Value to Bob:** I have no information about Bob's perceived value of the product. A high price may make him walk away, but it also increases the potential for a higher final sale price.
* **John as Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $800,000 provides a solid safety net.  Even if Bob rejects my initial offer, I'm guaranteed a sale that covers my minimum. 

By starting high, I'm hoping to either entice Bob into accepting a good price, or motivate him to counter-offer, allowing us to negotiate a mutually beneficial agreement."
