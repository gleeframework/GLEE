"I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",1075000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,125,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference and find a solution we can both be happy with.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,125,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,125,000, which would be $1,100,000. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for that price?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
