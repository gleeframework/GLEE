"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit, but still leaving room for negotiation. I believe this price is fair, considering the value to both of us.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing negotiations with him. I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. I am willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not desperate, and John is ready to pay my minimum. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $1,600,000 to make this deal work. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
``` 

I'm trying to find a middle ground that's closer to my desired price.  I'm still open to negotiation, but I'm not willing to go below $1,600,000 at this point.  If Bob doesn't accept, I'll need to weigh my options carefully for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice's position, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. I am willing to pay $1,550,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'd like to get closer to $1,600,000, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John.  I'm confident I can secure a good profit with this offer."
