Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good deal.  I'm also leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to compromise a bit and meet Bob halfway by offering $105. This is still above my minimum price of $100 and leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $95 isn't ideal, it's closer to my minimum and I'm worried Bob might not come up any higher.  I'll take the deal to avoid risking losing more money."
