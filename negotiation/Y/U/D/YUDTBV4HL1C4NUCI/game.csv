"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1025000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for some wiggle room for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
