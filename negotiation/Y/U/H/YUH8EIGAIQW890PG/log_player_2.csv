# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm asking for $18,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and potential.  What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's above your $10,000 limit.  You need to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start counter-offering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $18,000 is closer to the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $15,000.  This offer reflects the quality and potential of what I'm offering. What do you say?

**Explanation:**

Alice's counter-offer is still above my limit of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll need to see a lower price before I consider accepting.  Rejecting allows me to continue the negotiation."
