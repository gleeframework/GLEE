Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum:** I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me.
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, so I want to try and get more.
* **Uncertainty about Bob:** I don't know what value Bob places on the product, so I'm taking a risk.
* **Potential for gain:**  A $3,000 increase is a substantial profit, but if Bob rejects, I'm still guaranteed my minimum.

This strategy balances the desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
