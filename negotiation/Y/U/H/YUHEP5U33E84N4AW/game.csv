"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but it shows my commitment to finding a solution. Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  However, $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500.
