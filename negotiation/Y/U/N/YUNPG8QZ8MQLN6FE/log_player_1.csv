Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price of $19,000. I believe it will be incredibly valuable to you, and this offer stands before I move to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $10,000, we don't want to start there.  A higher initial offer leaves room for negotiation and creates the perception of value.
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a level of urgency for Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** It's unlikely Bob will accept $19,000 outright. However, this price gives you space to negotiate down towards his perceived value while still staying above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and potential counter-offers. Remember, you always have John as a guaranteed sale at $15,000."
