"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth a lot more to you. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate, but $10000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9000, which would still be a good profit for you.  Let's see if we can make this work!",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $9000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $9500? It's a fair compromise and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm willing to meet you halfway, $9500 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9250? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm willing to compromise, but $9250 is still a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9375?  This price is fair for both of us, and allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?",9375.0,Alice,5,
