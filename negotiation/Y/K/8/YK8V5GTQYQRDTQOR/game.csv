"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point you've presented is a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and presenting your counter-proposal.  However, $1,000,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,750,000.  This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your interest.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I understand the value of the product, but $1,750,000 is still outside my budget.  Would you consider $1,100,000?  This offer represents a significant investment on my part and moves us closer to a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in moving towards a deal. To be completely transparent,  $1,500,000 is the lowest I can go for this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be highly valuable for you.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
