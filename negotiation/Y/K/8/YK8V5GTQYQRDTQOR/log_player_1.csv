"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value and could greatly benefit your endeavors. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) and my minimum ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge how eager Bob is to purchase the product and how much negotiating power he thinks he has. 
* **Alternative Option:** Having John as a backup buyer provides a strong fallback position, allowing for more confident negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point you've presented is a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,200,000). Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially with John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and presenting your counter-proposal.  However, $1,000,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,750,000.  This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  While I rejected Bob's offer, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by making a significant move from my initial price. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** Offering a price exactly between my initial offer and his counteroffer creates an appearance of fairness.
* **Above Minimum:**  Importantly, this counteroffer still keeps the price well above my minimum acceptable threshold of $1,500,000. 
* **Time Consideration:**  We are still in the early rounds, and I want to give Bob the opportunity to make further counter-offers while also demonstrating that I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I understand the value of the product, but $1,750,000 is still outside my budget.  Would you consider $1,100,000?  This offer represents a significant investment on my part and moves us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob only increased his offer by $100,000, which suggests he's not  fully appreciating the value or is trying to negotiate very slowly.
* **Below Value:**  $1,100,000 is still significantly below his own perceived value of the product ($1,200,000), giving me leverage.
* **Backup Plan:** I have John as a reliable alternative buyer at $1,500,000, so there's no pressure to settle for a low price.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject this offer and, in the next round, provide a counteroffer that is a smaller concession than my previous one. This will signal that I'm willing to negotiate but am also becoming firmer in my desired price range.  I'll aim for a price closer to $1,500,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts in moving towards a deal. To be completely transparent,  $1,500,000 is the lowest I can go for this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be highly valuable for you."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm now presenting my absolute minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates seriousness while still offering Bob a chance to make a deal.
* **Transparency:** By being transparent about my bottom line, I'm hoping to build trust and encourage Bob to be more realistic in his offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value proposition to remind Bob of its potential benefits. 

**Moving Forward:**

By laying my cards on the table, I'm putting the ball squarely in Bob's court. He now needs to decide if the product is worth the investment. My firm stance at this stage will make it clear that further lowball offers are unlikely to succeed."
