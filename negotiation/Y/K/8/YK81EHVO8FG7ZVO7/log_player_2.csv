Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking something closer to $6,000 would be more in line with my budget. What do you think?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your response. I understand your budget considerations, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This would be a fair deal considering the benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $9,500 is still a little high for my budget.  How about $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a pattern here of lowballing, and frankly, my time is valuable.  $8,500 is my final offer â€“ it's a fair price considering what you're getting.  Let me know if you're serious about making a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice's offer of $8,500 is getting closer to your budget, it's still above what John is offering.  Alice's language also suggests she's not likely to go much lower. You can get the product for a guaranteed $8,000 from John, saving you money and negotiation hassle."
