{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have some negotiating room and time. He's consistently increasing his offer, showing he's motivated. We'll push a bit further before considering accepting or moving to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I feel we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make one final offer to demonstrate my commitment to working with you.  $1,100,000 is the best I can do. It's a strong offer, and I hope you'll agree."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting into the later rounds, and while Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we need to make a decision soon. By framing this as our ""final offer,"" we create a sense of urgency and potentially encourage Bob to accept or make a substantial counter-offer.  This price is still a significant profit over John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,070,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While we still have two rounds left, Bob is consistently increasing his offers, but at a very slow rate. Accepting his current offer of $1,070,000 gives us a $70,000 profit over John's offer. 

Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns at this point. There's a risk Bob's increases will be very small, and we might end up accepting an offer only slightly better than his current one, or even risk him walking away.  

Therefore, it's strategically sound to accept the current offer and secure a good profit."
