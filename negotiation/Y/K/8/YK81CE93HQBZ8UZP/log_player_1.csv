Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,500 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,750. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, $11,750 is a good price and I'm worried about further negotiation dragging on and potentially leading to a lower offer or even Bob walking away. It's a solid deal, and I'm happy to close it."
