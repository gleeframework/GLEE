"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that shows I'm serious about acquiring this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a price of $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate with me. While I acknowledge the value of the product, $1,075,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both make a final push.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
