"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $13,000.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $13,000 is tempting, I'm looking for a bit closer to $14,000 to make this work.  How about $13,500?  This would still leave a good margin for you, and would help me get closer to my target.",13500.0,Alice,3,
