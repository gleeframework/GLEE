"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $13,000 is tempting, I'm looking for a bit closer to $14,000 to make this work.  How about $13,500?  This would still leave a good margin for you, and would help me get closer to my target. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price.** At $13,500, Alice's offer is only $500 higher than Bob's initial counteroffer. 
* **Further negotiation could be risky.**  While Bob could potentially get a lower price, there's a chance Alice could reject his counteroffer again.  This could prolong the negotiation and potentially lead to him having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **The price is still within Bob's budget.** $13,500 is still below Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.

Therefore, accepting the offer seems like the best option in this round to secure the product without further risk."
