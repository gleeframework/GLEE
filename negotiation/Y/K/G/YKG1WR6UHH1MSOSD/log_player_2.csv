"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you know John is offering. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering! That price is a little high for me though. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, we signal that we're serious about getting a good deal. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Not Too Low:** While we want to save money, offering something ridiculously low (like $10) might offend Alice and make her less likely to negotiate. $65 is a lowball offer but still within the realm of possibility.
* **Polite and Open:** The tone remains friendly and respectful, encouraging further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $65. I can offer you a compromise at $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $90 is still more than John's offer. There's room to negotiate further and try to meet somewhere closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This is a classic negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties. It shows you're willing to compromise while still moving closer to your target.
* **Staying Firm:** We're not jumping up to her $90 offer, indicating we're still aiming for a lower price point.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  The language remains respectful and collaborative, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about we meet at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  $85 is only slightly above your $80 fallback option with John. 
* **Risk of Losing Out:** Further haggling might irritate Alice, and she could break off negotiations. 
* **Saving Some Money:**  You've still managed to get the price down from her initial $120 offer.

While you could try for a slightly better deal, accepting at $85 seems like a reasonable compromise at this stage."
