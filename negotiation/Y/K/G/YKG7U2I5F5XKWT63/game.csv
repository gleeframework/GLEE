"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the market value, but I believe my product is truly unique and has a higher value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $950000.
