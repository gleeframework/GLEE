"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not comfortable going above $15,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're eager to get the product, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $13,500? It's still a great deal for you, and a fair price for me.  Let's find a compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,500. How about $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,4,
