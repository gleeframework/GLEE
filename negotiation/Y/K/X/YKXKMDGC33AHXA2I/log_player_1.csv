"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I need. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to give it away for such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 just isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $10,500. This is my final offer, as I am also considering purchasing the product from another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly less than what I need. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not going to give away the product for much less than my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, but $10,500 isn't enough for me. I'm willing to make one last compromise and offer you the product for $11,250. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider selling to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 11250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. Considering the product's value, I would like to propose a price of $11,000. This is my final offer, as I am also exploring other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $11,000 is still below my ideal price, it's a good compromise. I've made several counteroffers and it seems like this is the best deal I'm going to get from Bob. It's important to close the deal and move on, rather than risk losing the sale altogether."
