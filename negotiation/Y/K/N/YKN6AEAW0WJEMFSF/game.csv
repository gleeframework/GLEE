"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $87.50? Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's split the difference. How about $91.25? It's a fair price that's closer to your offer and still allows me to get a decent return. Let me know what you think!",91.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'd be willing to meet you at $90, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,6,
