{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering the product for $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition, making it more likely Bob will consider the offer.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't come close to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting it would be a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob is offering below my minimum, he's clearly interested in the product. I can use this to my advantage and negotiate a higher price in the next round.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $120 gives me leverage in the negotiation.  I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair price. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $100 to $95, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain Value:**  $95 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but allows for a potential middle ground.
* **Positive Tone:** My message remains friendly and emphasizes finding a solution, encouraging Bob to keep negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $87.50? Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob has moved closer to my minimum, $87.50 is still below my desired price point.  Accepting it would be a significant loss.
* **Potential for Higher:** Bob has shown flexibility by moving from $80 to $87.50.  This indicates he's willing to negotiate further.
* **John's Offer is Safe:** I can still walk away and sell to John for $120, giving me the upper hand in negotiations.

I'll counteroffer Bob again to see if we can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's split the difference. How about $91.25? It's a fair price that's closer to your offer and still allows me to get a decent return. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 91.25}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering to meet Bob halfway between our previous offers, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain Margin:** $91.25 is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows a commitment to finding a solution.
* **Positive Tone:** My message remains friendly and encourages Bob to accept the offer, highlighting the fairness of the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'd be willing to meet you at $90, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not Enough:**  While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting it would be a loss for me.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** The negotiation has gone on for a while, and it's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to go much higher.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $120, which is my minimum target. There's no reason to continue negotiating with Bob at this point. 

I'm confident that John will be a reliable buyer, and I'm happy to secure a sale that meets my minimum price."
