"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would that be possible?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I respect that.  While I can't go as low as $11,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's make this happen!",11500.0,Alice,5,
