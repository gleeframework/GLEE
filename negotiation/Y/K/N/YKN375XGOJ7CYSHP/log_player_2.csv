"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay a maximum of $10,000 and Alice is offering the product for $10,000, there's no benefit to negotiating with her. Buying from John for $10,000 guarantees you get the product at your price limit."
