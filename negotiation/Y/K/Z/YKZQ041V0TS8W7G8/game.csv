"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $8,875? It's a fair compromise for both of us, and allows us to finalize this deal.",8875.0,Alice,5,
