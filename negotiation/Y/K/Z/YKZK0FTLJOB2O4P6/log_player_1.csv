"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to hearing your perspective."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and John's guaranteed offer ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" aiming to justify the high price and potentially shift Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** By stating ""I'm open to hearing your perspective,"" we signal willingness to negotiate, making it more likely Bob will engage in counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. After evaluating the product and its value, I believe we can reach a fair agreement. My counteroffer is $1,875,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,875,000 is a significant jump from his perceived value, it's still considerably lower than our starting price and well below John's guaranteed offer. We have room to negotiate further and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the product's value.  However, the price you're proposing doesn't accurately reflect the unique advantages and potential this product offers. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000.  I believe this is a fair and reasonable compromise."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and express understanding, fostering a positive negotiation environment.
* **Reiterating Value:** We again highlight the ""unique advantages and potential"" to subtly reinforce a higher perceived value in Bob's mind.
* **Strategic Concession:**  Our counteroffer is a significant reduction from our initial price but still keeps us comfortably above both Bob's valuation and John's offer.  This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while holding firm to a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've given this some further thought, Alice. While I respect your position, I still feel there's room for negotiation. My counteroffer is now at $1,950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offers, indicating a willingness to pay more than his initial valuation. However, we're still significantly above John's guaranteed $1,500,000. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can push Bob closer to the $2,000,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to find common ground.  To meet you halfway, I'm proposing a final price of $2,025,000.  This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a truly fair offer that reflects the product's immense value."",
""product_price"": 2025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency and Finality:** By introducing a ""final price,"" we inject a sense of urgency and signal that we're nearing the end of our concessions.
* **""Meeting Halfway"" Framing:** This creates a perception of fairness and compromise, even though we're still well above Bob's offer.
* **Strong Value Emphasis:**  We continue to reinforce the product's high value to justify the price point.

We are now in a strong bargaining position.  Bob's counter-offers suggest he's willing to go beyond his initial $1,000,000 valuation.  By holding firm near $2,000,000, we maximize our potential profit while still leaving room for Bob to potentially accept or propose a counter-offer very close to our target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued efforts in finding a mutually agreeable price. My final counteroffer is $1,975,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final counteroffer of $1,975,000 is very close to our desired price range. While we could potentially try to squeeze out a bit more, there's a risk that Bob will walk away.  Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit above John's guaranteed $1,500,000 and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
