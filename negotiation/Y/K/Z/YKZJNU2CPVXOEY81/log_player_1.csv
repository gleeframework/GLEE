I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to secure a good profit. I'm aware I could potentially sell to John for $12,000, but I'm aiming for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I'm still aiming for a profit.  This counteroffer is halfway between my initial price and Bob's offer.  Hopefully, we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, and continuing to negotiate may risk losing him as a buyer.  I'll accept his offer and secure the sale."
