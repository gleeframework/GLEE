Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149.  I think you'll find it's a steal at this price!"", ""product_price"": 149}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Acceptable Price:** You're willing to sell for $150 (your value) but want to maximize profit.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **John as Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale at $150 if Bob refuses.

By offering the product at $149, you are aiming for the highest price Bob might be willing to pay while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price.  There's no incentive to go lower since John provides a guaranteed sale at $150."
