"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you, and I know you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within his budget, it's still above his ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob is offering a price that's closer to his ideal price point but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic positioning:** A counteroffer that's only slightly lower than Alice's offer shows Bob is serious about buying but also willing to negotiate. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will give Bob an idea of how flexible Alice is on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  While $12,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above ideal price:**  $13,500 is still higher than Bob's ideal price of $12,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  There is still room to negotiate, and Alice has shown some willingness to come down in price. 
* **Strategic play:** By rejecting, Bob can continue to negotiate and try to get a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:** Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing he's willing to compromise.
* **Meeting halfway:** $13,000 is a halfway point between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer, making it seem like a reasonable compromise.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** Bob is framing the offer as a fair deal for both parties to encourage Alice to accept."
