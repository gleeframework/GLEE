"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy. Here's why:

* **Buying from Alice saves you money:** You'll pay $1,200,000, which is less than the $1,500,000 you'd pay to John.
* **You still get the product:** You achieve your goal of buying the product.

While you could reject Alice's offer and buy from John, it would cost you an extra $300,000."
