"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to lower the price to $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $85 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $80, which is my absolute minimum. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",80.0,Alice,5,
