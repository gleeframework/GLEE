"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be happy to purchase the product for $1,250,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $1,250,000. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,275,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,260,000, which is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. Let's finalize this deal.",1260000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1,260,000. Considering the value of the product to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to compromise again. I'm proposing a price of $1,290,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",1290000.0,Alice,5,
