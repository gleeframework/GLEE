"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for some room for us to reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1025000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows for both of us to make a profit. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement with a little more negotiation.  Let me know what you think.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, thank you for continuing to work with me. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1030000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably pay at this time. I'm willing to offer $1015000 for the product. This is a very fair price, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",1015000.0,Bob,6,
