"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $1400000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal that can work.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1300000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm confident we can make a deal at this price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1300000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that $1275000 is a fair and mutually beneficial price.  This represents a good compromise and allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this deal happen!",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to go down to $1290000, but I need to be confident that this is the best deal for me. I'm willing to consider this price, but I need you to be serious about moving forward with the sale.",1290000.0,Alice,5,
