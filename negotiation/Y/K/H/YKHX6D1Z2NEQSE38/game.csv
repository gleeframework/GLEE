"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a significant discount to consider it. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,800,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $1,300,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I understand your position, but the product's value warrants a higher price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,600,000. This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you say that's your final offer, but I need to see some more flexibility from your side. $1,450,000 is the best I can do. If we can make this work, we have a deal.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
