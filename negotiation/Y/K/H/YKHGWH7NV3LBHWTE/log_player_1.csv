Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $925,000. I believe this price reflects the significant benefit you stand to gain from it."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing his valuation is higher than John's.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but there's still a chance he'll accept the initial price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $925,000 is significantly closer to Bob's valuation ($1,000,000) than your minimum ($800,000). This makes it more likely he'll see it as a good deal compared to losing the opportunity. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk with the potential for a significantly higher profit than selling to John."
