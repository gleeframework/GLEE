Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob's counteroffers are moving in the right direction. Let's see if we can nudge him a bit higher."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so how about $977,500? This feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $977,500.

Bob is clearly very interested and is willing to negotiate. While we might be able to squeeze a bit more out of him, $977,500 is a strong offer and well above our fallback position with John.  Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or us accidentally pushing him away in further rounds."
