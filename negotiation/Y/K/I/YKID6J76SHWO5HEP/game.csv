"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,300,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $1,150,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
