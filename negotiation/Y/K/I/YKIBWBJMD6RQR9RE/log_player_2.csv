"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this product, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the chance to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $875,000 is a good price for Bob. This is a good compromise that is within Bob's budget and still allows Alice to make a profit.  While it is possible to continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers or Bob running out of rounds and having to buy from John for a higher price is too high.  Accepting the offer is the most sensible decision at this point."
