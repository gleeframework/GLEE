"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective. However, $1200000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the potential of the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1300000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. How about we settle on $1350000? It's a fair compromise and a price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're open to that.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $1250000 is still a little lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1300000. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Is that a deal?",1250000.0,Bob,8,
