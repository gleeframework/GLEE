Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price (your ""reservation value"").
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Unknown Information:** You don't know if Bob has other options or how eager he is to buy.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to capture as much of the value difference (between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000) as possible. However, being too aggressive could lead Bob to reject the offer. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value increases your chances of securing a higher final price.
* **Justification:**  While not essential, vaguely mentioning ""unique value"" and ""other interested parties"" can subtly nudge Bob towards accepting.
* **Time Pressure:**  Creating a sense of urgency can encourage a quicker decision in your favor.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:**  Bob might counter-offer. Be ready to negotiate but hold firm to a price that's comfortably above your $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Don't Reveal Your Minimum:**  Never disclose your fallback option (selling to John) as it weakens your negotiating position."
