"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $95. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $92. If you can't go that low, I might have to go with John's offer.",92.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $94, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a deal. What do you think?",94.0,Alice,5,
