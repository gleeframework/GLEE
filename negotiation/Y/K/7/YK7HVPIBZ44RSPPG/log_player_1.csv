"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer is less than what John is offering, it's better to sell to John.
