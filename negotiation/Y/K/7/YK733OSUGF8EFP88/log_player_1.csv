I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a decent profit margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I'm not willing to sell at that price. I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,000. This is still a good profit for me and is closer to my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price considering his initial offer."
