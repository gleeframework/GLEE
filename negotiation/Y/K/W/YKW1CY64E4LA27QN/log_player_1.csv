Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, we can afford to start negotiations high. This leaves room for potential negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valuable.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's ""unique value"" without explicitly revealing our bottom line.  This helps justify the high initial price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By saying ""we can discuss further,""  we signal to Bob that we're open to negotiation and finding a mutually agreeable price.

**Goal:**

The ideal outcome is that Bob accepts our initial offer, or we negotiate down to a price significantly higher than $15,000. If Bob rejects the offer, we can always fall back on selling to John at our minimum acceptable price."
