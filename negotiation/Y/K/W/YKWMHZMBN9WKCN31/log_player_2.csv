{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far above his budget, and he has other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

Bob should start by offering his maximum price, $8,000.  He knows this is the price he's willing to pay and sets a clear boundary for the negotiation."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial offer, $15,000 is still outside his budget. He has the option to buy from John for a lower price, so there's no reason to accept this offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

Bob should increase his offer slightly to $9,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still staying within his budget. He's trying to find a middle ground with Alice, but also needs to be mindful of his own financial constraints."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is lower than previous offers, it still sits above his maximum budget. He can still purchase the product from John for a lower price and shouldn't settle for anything more than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob should continue to increase his offer, but only slightly. He's aiming for a middle ground, but needs to be cautious about exceeding his budget.  Offering $10,000 demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while staying within his financial limits."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than previous offers, it's still above his maximum budget. He can still get the product from John for a lower price. He shouldn't compromise on his budget unless he feels there's a strong possibility of Alice lowering the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

Bob should continue to increase his offer, but only slightly. He's aiming for a middle ground, but needs to be cautious about exceeding his budget. Offering $11,000 demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while staying within his financial limits. He's getting closer to Alice's price point, but still needs to be careful about overpaying."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice is coming down in price, she's still above Bob's budget. He's only got one round left, and it's unlikely Alice will drop to his desired price point. It's better to guarantee the purchase at a price he can afford, rather than risk getting a worse deal or not getting the product at all."
