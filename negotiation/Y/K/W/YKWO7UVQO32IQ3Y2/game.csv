"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the uniqueness of this product, $850000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $600000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product while still leaving room for a profitable deal for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $725000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to offer $675000. This offer reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $675000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $700000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",700000.0,Alice,5,
