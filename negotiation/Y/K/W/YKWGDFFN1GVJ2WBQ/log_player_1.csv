Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer it for a price closer to John's offer ($800,000), aiming higher allows us to potentially maximize our profit.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Offering it at $1,100,000 provides him a significant saving of $100,000, making it a very attractive deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a strong opening offer, it leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob (who offers higher profit potential) and ensuring we don't lose the sale entirely (as we have John as a backup)."
