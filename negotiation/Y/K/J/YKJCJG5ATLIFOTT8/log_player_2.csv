{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,750,000 is far above his budget and he can likely get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $800,000.  Let's start with a price of $850,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $850,000 is lower than I expected, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her previous offer, $1,300,000 is still above Bob's budget. He should keep negotiating to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm really limited to $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to come to an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  While $950,000 is still below my desired price, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's try $1,200,000. This offer acknowledges your budget while also allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is still above his budget, and he has already demonstrated his willingness to walk away.  He should continue negotiating to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,200,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in your product. Let's make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your genuine interest in the product.  While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not able to go that low.  Let's aim for $1,150,000. This price is a fair compromise that allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's also within your budget range. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,150,000 is still above his budget.  He should continue negotiating to try to get a lower price or consider buying from John. He has 3 rounds left and can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking to stay under $1,100,000.  Let's try $1,075,000.  It's a significant increase from my last offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product and our mutual need for a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,075,000 is closer to my goal, I need to be able to make a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,125,000. This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  We're both close to agreeing, and this offer represents a real opportunity for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Even though Alice is coming closer to his budget, there's only one round left. He's unlikely to be able to negotiate a price lower than $1,125,000 in that one round.  It's more advantageous to buy from John at $800,000 and secure the product within his budget."
