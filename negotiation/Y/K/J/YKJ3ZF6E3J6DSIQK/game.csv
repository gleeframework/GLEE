"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it's really valuable, but I'm willing to let it go for $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $80.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $80 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's a fair offer for a product you'll surely appreciate.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still out of my range.  How about we split the difference at $95?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to get a reasonable price for this product. How about we settle at $105? That's my final offer.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still above what I can afford.  How about we try $98? This is a fair price for both of us and lets me stay within my budget.  Let's close the deal.",98.0,Bob,6,
