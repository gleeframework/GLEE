Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it will bring to your operations."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000 gives us room to negotiate above John's $800,000 offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves a potential $100,000 profit for Bob, making it a tempting offer while securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $1,100,000,  there might be a slight possibility for Bob to negotiate a slightly higher price, further maximizing your profit."
