"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, I'm looking to spend closer to $10000 on this product. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11250. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,
