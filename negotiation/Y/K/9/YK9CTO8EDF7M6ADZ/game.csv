"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for expressing interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understand your budget constraints. While I'd like to accommodate your needs, I must maintain the integrity of our pricing strategy. I am willing to consider a counteroffer of $700,000 for the product. This still represents a significant discount compared to the original price, while allowing us to maintain a fair margin. I hope this proposal works for you. Please let me know your thoughts.",700000.0,Alice,3,
