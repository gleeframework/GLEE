Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offers, Alice. I still believe we can find a fair compromise within my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,150,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,150,000 makes the most sense at this stage. It exceeds my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further protracted negotiations."
