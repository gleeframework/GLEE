"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I know how valuable it would be for you, so I'm starting the bidding at $1,300,000.  I think this is a fair starting point considering its potential worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price given the potential value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, but I can't accept anything below $1,200,000. This product has the potential to generate significant value, and I'm confident that this price reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing both of us to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
