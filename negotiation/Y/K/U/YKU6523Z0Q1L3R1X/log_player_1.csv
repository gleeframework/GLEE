I'm starting with a high offer, but still below Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate while maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than what I'd prefer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway. This offer is a compromise between my previous offer and his counteroffer.  I hope he'll see it as a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, and it seems unlikely he'll go higher. It's time to secure the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
