"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $750,000 is still a good offer, I believe I can get closer to my goal of $800,000. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my desire to work with you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. Would you be willing to consider this revised offer?

You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $775,000 is getting closer to my goal, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can find a more agreeable middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $775,000 is still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $812,500. This would be a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 812500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $812,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $790,000, but no more. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $790,000 is tempting, I'm only $10,000 away from my target price with John, and I have a few rounds left to potentially get closer to my goal with Bob. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. $790,000 is a good offer, but I'm just a hair away from my target price.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your desire to meet your target price, Alice, but $795,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $790,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Would you be willing to accept this offer?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough decision, as I'm only $10,000 away from my target price with Bob. However, with only two rounds left, I'm not confident I can secure a higher price from him. It's time to lock in the guaranteed $800,000 with John."
