"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $850,000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This allows you a significant saving compared to the product's true value to you, while still letting me achieve a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
