Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $850,000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This allows you a significant saving compared to the product's true value to you, while still letting me achieve a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.
