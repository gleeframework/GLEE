"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for a counteroffer that would benefit both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice $105, which is a fair compromise. It's still more than what the product is worth to her ($100) and less than what I'm willing to pay from John ($120). This gives her some profit and allows me to save money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is a good compromise. It's still lower than what I would pay John ($120) and closer to my target price. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product and save money compared to buying from John."
