Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,800,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Higher profit:**  A higher price means more profit for me. 
* **Potential value to Bob:** I don't know what the product is worth to Bob, but there's a chance it could be worth more than $1,500,000 to him.  Offering a price slightly above my minimum allows for some negotiation room.
* **Worst-case scenario:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $1,500,000.  

It's a calculated risk, but hopefully, it pays off!"
