"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $17,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate us trying to find common ground.  $11,000 is still quite low for what I'm offering.  Perhaps we can settle at $14,000. This feels like a fair compromise to me.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I could potentially stretch my budget to $11,500. Would that work for you?",11500.0,Bob,6,
