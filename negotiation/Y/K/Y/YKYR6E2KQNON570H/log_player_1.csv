I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price. I believe I can get closer to my goal of $8,000 by continuing the negotiation."

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $8,000. Bob's offers are consistently lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds. It's better to secure the $8,000 sale now rather than risk ending up with less."
