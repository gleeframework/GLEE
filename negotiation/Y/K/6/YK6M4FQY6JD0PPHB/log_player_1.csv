"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a strong starting point that leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer. I'm also keeping in mind the value of the product to me and the fact that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations fail."
