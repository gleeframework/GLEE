"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm willing to part with for a price of $15000. I believe it's worth every penny, and I think you'll find it to be a valuable addition to your collection.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $13500, which is still a great deal for you, but also reflects the value I place on the product. I'm open to further negotiation, but I think this is a fair starting point.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking of offering $13000. I'm confident that this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not quite ready to meet you there. I'm willing to take another step closer, though. I can do $13250, which is a very good deal for you, and still reflects the value I place on the product. I'm open to further negotiation, but I think this is a fair starting point.",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, as I mentioned before. I'm not sure if you're willing to go any lower, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can you meet me at $13000?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable meeting you at $13000. I'm willing to take one more step closer, though. I can do $13100, which is a very good deal for you, and still reflects the value I place on the product. I'm open to further negotiation, but I think this is a fair starting point.",13100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13000 and $13100, which would be $13050. I'm hoping we can agree on this price and finalize the deal.",13050.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable meeting you at $13050. I'm willing to take one more step closer, though. I can do $13025, which is a very good deal for you, and still reflects the value I place on the product. I'm open to further negotiation, but I think this is a fair starting point.",13025.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13025 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $12900, which is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. If we can't agree on this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $15000.",12900.0,Bob,10,
