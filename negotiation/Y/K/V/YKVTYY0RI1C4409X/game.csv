"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to explain the product's value. However,  $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential within my business.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $600,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that I think will benefit both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending. I could go up to $700,000. If that's not workable, I understand, but I hope we can find a solution that benefits us both.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
