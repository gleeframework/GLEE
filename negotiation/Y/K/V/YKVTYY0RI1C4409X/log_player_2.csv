"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $600,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that I think will benefit both of us. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $850,000. Since you have the option to buy from John for $800,000, it makes more financial sense to take that deal and save the extra $50,000."
