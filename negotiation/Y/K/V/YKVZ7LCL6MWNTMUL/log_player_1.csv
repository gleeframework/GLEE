Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe I can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. How about we set the product price at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob. $95 is too low for me, even though I could sell it to John for $100. I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $95 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I would like to propose $102.50 as a compromise. This way, we both get a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $102.5 is a good compromise.  It's more than my minimum of $100, and it's likely that we'll continue to go back and forth with offers if I reject him.  Accepting this offer is the best choice to finalize the deal and move on."
