"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $925,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while still being mindful of the price.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about budget, but $925,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $975,000, which is a significant drop from my initial offer.  It's time to close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, it's time to wrap this up.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $950,000 and we have a deal?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm ready to close this deal for $962,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and our back-and-forth negotiation. Let's make this happen!",962500.0,Alice,7,
