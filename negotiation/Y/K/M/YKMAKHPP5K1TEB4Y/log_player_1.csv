{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a substantial profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is closer to my value than Bob's. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Appealing to Bob's self-interest:** I highlight the potential profit for Bob, making the offer more attractive.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  $1,000,000 is a significant amount, so I expect Bob to counter. This sets the stage for negotiation.

**Important Note:**  I will monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he's unwilling to budge, I'll be ready to either accept a counteroffer close to my minimum or walk away and sell to John for my guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum of $1,200,000, it's still not a good enough deal for me.
* **Potential for a better outcome:**  I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob, especially since he's expressed interest in the product.
* **Risk vs. reward:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me a good profit, but there's a chance I can get even more from Bob if I continue negotiating. 

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll aim for a price closer to my target while still being realistic about his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest in the product, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within the negotiation range:**  $950,000 is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer while still being above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting the compromise:**  I emphasize that this is a significant reduction from my initial offer to demonstrate my willingness to negotiate.
* **Focusing on shared benefit:** I frame the offer as a ""fair compromise"" that benefits both parties.

**Next Steps:**

* **Monitor Bob's response:**  If Bob accepts, I'll finalize the deal.
* **Prepare for further negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to make another counteroffer, potentially lowering the price slightly further while keeping in mind my minimum and the potential deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While $920,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough to make it worth the risk of continuing negotiations.
* **Time is a factor:** We've gone through multiple rounds of negotiation, and the longer it drags on, the less likely I am to get my desired price.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures a significant profit and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiations.

**Next Step:**

I will choose to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This decision guarantees me a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob."
