"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a substantial profit. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest in the product, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value you place on the product.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your budget constraints.  To be frank, $920,000 isn't quite enough for me to make this deal work. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering a final price of $935,000. This is my absolute bottom line, and I truly believe this is a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, or we can move on.",935000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but $935,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $915,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it.",915000.0,Bob,6,
