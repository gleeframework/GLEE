"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However,  $12,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind.  Would you consider $8,000?  That's the very top of my budget for this.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $10,500. It's a good middle ground, and I think you'll still get a great deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you've been very accommodating and I appreciate that.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,750. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,7,
