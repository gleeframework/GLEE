"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This offer is too high. Alice is starting at a price significantly above your maximum. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $100."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Polite and appreciative:**  It acknowledges Alice's offer and keeps the tone positive.
* **Signals interest:** It explicitly states that you are interested in the product.
* **Provides a reasonable counter:**  $100 is a significant drop from $150 but leaves room for further negotiation while staying within a potentially acceptable range for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $125, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has come down in price, $125 is still above your maximum budget and what you know John will sell it for. There's room to negotiate further or take the guaranteed deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  To be totally honest, $120 is the absolute most I can do.  It's a fair offer considering the market value, and I'm ready to buy it right now at that price."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Transparency:** You're being upfront with Alice about your budget limit, which can build trust. 
* **Justification:** You're giving a reason for your counter-offer (""market value"") without revealing you have an alternative seller.
* **Urgency and Clarity:** You're signaling that this is your final offer and you're ready to close the deal immediately if she accepts.

This strategy aims to convince Alice to take the guaranteed $120 rather than risk losing the sale entirely."
