"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own a high-value item that will bring you significant benefits. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $12,000. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,500. This is my best offer.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $10,500, which is a significant discount from the original price. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $10,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about this product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can do $9,750, which is a bit closer to your offer. I think we're getting closer to a deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $9,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going below $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,750, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one last time. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,7,
