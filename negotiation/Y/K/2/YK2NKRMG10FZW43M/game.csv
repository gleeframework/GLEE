"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for this product.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident it reflects its value. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  This price reflects the quality and potential of the product.  What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. ",11000.0,Bob,4,
