Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.  But, I'm staying within my budget and not giving in too quickly."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**  I'm trying to find a compromise by meeting Alice halfway between her offer and my last offer. I'm also expressing my willingness to close the deal, which could encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $125. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $127.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above my ideal price point. I've already been through several rounds of negotiation, and with only three rounds left, I'm at risk of not getting the product at all. Buying from John for $100 ensures I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with, even if it's not the lowest possible price."
