"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I believe you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

This is a great deal for Bob! Alice's offer of $950,000 is significantly less than both his maximum budget ($1,200,000) and what John is offering."
