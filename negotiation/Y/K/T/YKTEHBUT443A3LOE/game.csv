"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125? I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to go up to $115, but that's as high as I can go.",115.0,Bob,4,
