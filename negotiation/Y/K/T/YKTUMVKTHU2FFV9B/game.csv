"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe it's a bit steep at the current price, and I'd like to discuss a more reasonable price point.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. We appreciate your feedback and would like to counter your offer with a price of $1350000. We believe this reflects the value of the product while remaining competitive in the market.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a more aggressive counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1200000, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Considering your position, Bob, we're willing to meet halfway. Therefore, we propose a final offer of $1275000 for the product. This reflects a compromise between our original asking price and your counteroffer.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make a slightly lower offer of $1250000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price.",1250000.0,Bob,6,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a slightly lower offer of $1250000, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to come to an agreement, and I'd rather consider alternative options.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"We've carefully considered your most recent offer, Bob. As a final attempt to reach an agreement, we're willing to settle on $1260000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise that aims to satisfy both parties involved.",1260000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1250000, and if you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John for $1000000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement, but I need to make a decision soon.",1250000.0,Bob,10,
