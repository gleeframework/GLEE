Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a much higher profit.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing my hand.  The phrase ""before I list it publicly"" subtly implies there might be other interested buyers, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can always fall back on selling to John at my minimum acceptable price."
