"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $850000 is a good offer, I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price.  I'm willing to come down a bit and offer it to you for $900000. This reflects the significant value it holds, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be more aggressive on the price. I'm willing to go up to $860000. Can you meet me there?",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $860000 doesn't quite cover the value of this product for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $880000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair to both of us. Let me know your decision.",880000.0,Alice,5,
