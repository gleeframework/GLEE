Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to sell the product for $110, as it's worth at least $120 to me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested, but $110 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115? I think it's a fair price, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $112.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $112.50 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'll counteroffer one more time to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. Let's try $113.50. It's a small step closer to your offer and a fair compromise, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 113.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $113.50 is the best price for me. I'm willing to go up to $112, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now, and we haven't been able to agree on a price that's satisfactory for both of us. Since I'm not willing to go any lower than $120, it's time to move on. John is a reliable buyer who's willing to pay my minimum price, so I'll sell the product to him."
