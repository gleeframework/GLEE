"Alice, I appreciate you reaching out.  While I'm interested in the product, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and leaves room for both of us to make a profit. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  I've given this offer careful consideration, and to be completely transparent, I'm aiming for a slightly higher return.
