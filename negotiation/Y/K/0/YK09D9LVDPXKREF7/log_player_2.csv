"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, leaving room for negotiation. While buying from John is an option, it's best to see if we can get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the starting point,  $1,100,000 is a bit low for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim Low:** Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer allows room for negotiation and probes Alice's willingness to move on price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By countering aggressively, we establish ourselves as serious buyers but also signal a desire for a highly favorable deal. 
* **Information Gathering:**  Alice's response to this counter-offer will give us valuable information about her flexibility and help us decide our next move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving towards our price range, but we still have room to negotiate. She's trying to find a middle ground, which indicates potential for a lower price. It's worth another counteroffer before considering John's less appealing deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,025,000?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counter-offer proposes a classic compromise,  signaling our willingness to move closer to her price while still aiming for significant savings.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  By continuing to negotiate, we keep the pressure on Alice and maintain control of the negotiation pace. 
* **Approaching the Limit:** We are getting closer to a price point where buying from John might become a more attractive alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $1,025,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,075,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we could likely negotiate a slightly lower price, the potential savings are getting smaller with each round.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate has a cost in terms of time and effort. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the risk of Alice becoming less flexible.
* **Favorable Price:** $1,075,000 is significantly lower than both our initial budget and John's offer, making it a solid outcome."
