"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $600,000 for it to make sense for me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I can meet you in the middle at $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, but that's still quite a gap for me.  I could go up to $700,000 if that works for you. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still looking for a deal, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $700,000. I can try to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $700,000, which would be $850,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm willing to consider it a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,5,
