Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $170 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $140. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $125. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

It's unlikely Alice will go below $125, and it's not worth risking a higher counteroffer. John offers a guaranteed price that meets my needs."
