Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Strategic Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value and Bob's business sense, framing the higher price as justified rather than arbitrary. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The phrasing ""proposing a price"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" leaves room open for negotiation if Bob counters. This gives you a chance to potentially secure a price even higher than John's offer.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with selling to John at your minimum acceptable price."
