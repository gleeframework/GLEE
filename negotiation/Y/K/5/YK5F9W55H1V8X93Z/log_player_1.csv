"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $9,500, which is a bit above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal to encourage Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Room for compromise:**  I'm setting the stage for potential counteroffers while still aiming for a price close to my minimum. 
* **Alternative buyer:** I'm keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While I'm open to negotiation, $8,500 is significantly below my minimum of $10,000. 
* **Potential for a higher price:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob by making a counteroffer.
* **John as a backup:** I'm comfortable holding out for a higher price knowing I can always sell to John for $10,000."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm prepared to offer $8,800 for the product.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're willing to go up in price, and I appreciate that. However, $8,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000.
