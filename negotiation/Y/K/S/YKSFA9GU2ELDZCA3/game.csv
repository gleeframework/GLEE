"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can make a real difference in your business. To kick off our negotiation, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $1,800,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it, given its potential benefit to my business. I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for countering. I understand your perspective on the price. Considering the value this product brings, particularly to your specific business needs, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $1,600,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product, and it's the maximum I can offer. I hope we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
