Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob for $120, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  This gives Bob a chance to accept, and if he rejects, it allows me to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with a price of $110. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $120, but still above Bob's offer of $95. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also maintains a price that's still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $105.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially drag on and lead to me selling to John for $120, which is a risk I'm not willing to take.  $105 is a good compromise and ensures a sale."
