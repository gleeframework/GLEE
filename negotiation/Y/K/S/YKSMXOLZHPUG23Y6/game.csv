"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $17,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  I'd be happy to pay $14,000 for the product.  What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little,  I'll accept $15,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get out of it. Let me know if you're interested.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $15,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $15,250?  I'm serious about buying this product, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",15250.0,Bob,4,
