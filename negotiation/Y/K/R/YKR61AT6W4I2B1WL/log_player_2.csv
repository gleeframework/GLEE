"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$600,000 is a good starting point, but it's likely Alice is willing to go lower. It's worth exploring if we can get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming to start with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This will give us room to negotiate and see how flexible Alice is on the price. A $400,000 offer is a substantial discount, and I'm confident that Alice will either accept or come back with a more reasonable counter-offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $500,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than my target.  I want to see if we can continue to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some willingness to compromise by reducing her price from $600,000 to $500,000.  I'm increasing my counteroffer to $450,000, which is a halfway point between our previous offers.  This shows good faith while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $550,000 is getting closer to my target price. While I could continue to negotiate, it's becoming increasingly risky to reject further offers. We're nearing the middle ground, and the potential gains from continued negotiation might not outweigh the risk of losing the deal altogether.  Accepting the offer at this point secures the product at a reasonable price within my budget."
