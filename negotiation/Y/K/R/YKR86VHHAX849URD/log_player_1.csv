Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Reasoning:** I'm offering a ""fair price"" based on Bob's perceived value to create a sense of urgency and encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message is open-ended, inviting Bob to engage in further discussion. 
* **Plan B:**  Remember, I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price of $1,200,000. This gives me leverage and a firm limit during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  I have leverage because I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay my full price. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price, aiming to close the gap towards my target. 

I'm choosing to **RejectOffer** and will counter Bob with a new offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by increasing my offer to $950,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position.
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""great deal for both of us,"" highlighting the potential benefits for both parties. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000), but this counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate in good faith.
* **Avoid Immediate Deal:**  I'm not yet ready to accept Bob's offer. By proposing $950,000, I'm putting the ball back in Bob's court, allowing him to consider this offer and potentially bring his own price up."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer of $925,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Exhaustion:**  We've been through several rounds of negotiation, and Bob's offers haven't moved much closer to my target price. 
* **Leverage and Backup Buyer:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John at my desired price of $1,200,000. It's time to take advantage of this secure option.

I'm choosing to **SellToJhon** as it provides a guaranteed outcome that meets my financial goals. Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to produce a significantly better outcome."
