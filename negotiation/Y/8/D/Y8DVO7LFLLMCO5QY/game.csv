"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm confident you'll see what a great deal this is.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. This product would be useful, but not at that price.  Would you consider something closer to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $22,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $14,500?",14500.0,Bob,4,
