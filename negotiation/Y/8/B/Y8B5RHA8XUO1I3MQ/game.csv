"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you taking the time to present this opportunity.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and for sharing your perspective. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is a significant gap from where I see the value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's worth.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a fair price considering the value we've both discussed.  This is my final offer, let me know if you're able to accept it.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
