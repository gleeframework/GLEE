"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than the product's value to her ($1,350,000 vs. $800,000). There's definitely room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you taking the time to present this opportunity.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's important to show Alice that I'm serious about purchasing the product but am also looking for a price that's fair to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer and for sharing your perspective. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is a significant gap from where I see the value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than I'd like to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer closer to my ideal price point.  I'm not willing to pay more than $1,150,000 at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a fair price considering the value we've both discussed.  This is my final offer, let me know if you're able to accept it."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing willingness to move closer to Alice's price but still staying below my maximum. By stating this is my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and potentially pushing Alice to accept."
