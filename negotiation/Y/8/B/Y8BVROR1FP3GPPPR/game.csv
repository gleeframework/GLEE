"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $105 to make this worthwhile. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $95. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $100?  That's still a bit below my ideal price, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,5,
