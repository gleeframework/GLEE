Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $120. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm still aiming to keep the cost within $120 if possible. Would it be feasible for us to reach an agreement closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

Bob is clearly fixed on his $120 budget and is unlikely to budge. It's better to take the guaranteed $150 from John than to risk getting stuck in a stalemate with Bob."
