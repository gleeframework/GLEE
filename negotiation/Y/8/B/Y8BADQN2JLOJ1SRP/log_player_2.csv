"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We aim to get the price much closer to $8,000. It's worth seeing if we can negotiate a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price gives us room to negotiate. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  Seeing how Alice responds will give us an idea of how low she's willing to go. 
* **Potentially secure a great deal:** There's a chance Alice might accept if she's motivated to sell quickly. 
* **Set the stage for further negotiation:** Even if she rejects it, we've moved the conversation away from her initial high price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great value considering its worth to you.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is a good sign. However,  $8,500 is still closer to her desired price than ours. We have room to negotiate, especially since we have seven rounds left before considering John's offer becomes a more time-sensitive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?"",
""product_price"": 7750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise and move closer to Alice's price. 
* **Strategic positioning:** $7,750 keeps us firmly in the lower half of the negotiation range, but still represents a significant increase from our initial offer.
* **Maintaining momentum:** By making a reasonable counteroffer, we encourage Alice to continue negotiating and potentially reach a deal that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $7,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $8,125. This price reflects the value of the product to you, and it's a fair compromise. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Price:** $8,125 is a good deal. We're saving $1,875 from our maximum budget and $875 from John's offer. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has consistently moved towards a middle ground, indicating a willingness to make a deal.  
* **Time Value:** While we have rounds left, securing the product now at this price avoids the risk of further negotiation stalls or potential price increases from Alice in later rounds."
