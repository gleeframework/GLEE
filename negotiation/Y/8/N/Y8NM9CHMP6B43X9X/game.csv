"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $16500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $16500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $16000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $16000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13000 and $16000. I'll offer $14500 for the product. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not getting the price I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $17000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",17000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I've made several compromises, and I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting close to walking away. I'll offer $14000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I expect you to meet me at this price.",14000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make one last offer, but I'm not willing to meet you at $14000. I've already made several compromises, and I think I've been fair. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can offer it to you for $16250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",16250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go above $14000, and you're still not meeting me at that price. I'm afraid I'm going to have to walk away from the deal. I'm going to buy the product from John for $15000 instead.",14000.0,Bob,10,
