"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. How about $750,000? ",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to negotiate further, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. Considering the value you've expressed for the product, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product for $800,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
