"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. However, $14,500 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
