Alice's offer is too high. It is not worth it to buy the product at that price. 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price."

While $130 is better than $150, it's still higher than my limit of $100. I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice is still too high with her offer. It's better to buy from John at this point."
