"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Would you be open to $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I think that's a fair price for the value this product brings.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $115. It's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $125? I think that's a fair price for the value this product brings, and it's closer to my original price.",125.0,Alice,5,
