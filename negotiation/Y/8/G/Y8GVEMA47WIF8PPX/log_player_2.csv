Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, I was thinking we could meet at $1,150,000. This is a good compromise considering the value you place on the product and the price I'm willing to accept. I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $1,150,000 is still above your ideal price of $1,000,000, but it's getting closer.  You've already made two counteroffers, and while you could continue negotiating, there's a chance Alice might become unwilling to budge further.  

Given that you're comfortable paying up to $1,500,000 for the product, accepting Alice's offer at $1,150,000 is a good deal. You'll save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John, and it's within your budget. It's a good compromise, and you can secure the product without further haggling."
