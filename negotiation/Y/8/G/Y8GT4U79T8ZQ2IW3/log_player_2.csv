"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's value of $800,000. This means there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a better price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the deal, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob is serious about getting a better price.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $900,000 is still above Alice's value, giving her room to negotiate.  This makes it a reasonable offer that doesn't immediately shut down the deal.
* **Setting the Tone:**  The message is polite but firm, establishing that Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $950,000? That's still a significant discount from what the product is worth to you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, but there's still room to negotiate.  Bob should continue to push for a better price.  While $950,000 is a decent deal, it's still higher than his target of saving as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to come in a bit lower.  How about $925,000?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Adjustment:** Bob is continuing to negotiate by offering a slightly lower price than Alice's last offer. This shows that he's willing to compromise but is also committed to getting the best price possible.
* **Fair Compromise:**  $925,000 is a price that is in the middle ground between Alice's last offer and Bob's previous counteroffer. This makes it a fair and potentially acceptable price for both parties. 
* **Finalizing the Deal:** Bob emphasizes the desire to finalize the deal, subtly putting pressure on Alice to accept this offer."
