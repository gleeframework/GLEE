"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the value the product holds for Bob, increasing his incentive to accept.
* **Open to Discussion:** I use friendly language to encourage Bob to counteroffer and continue the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to get the best possible price while remaining open to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the deal, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:**  My target is still above $900,000, as Bob clearly values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price than Bob's offer.
* **Avoiding Immediate Sale:**  Selling to John for $800,000 is my last resort.  I want to maximize my profit by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $950,000? That's still a significant discount from what the product is worth to you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Negotiation:** I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to settle for his first counteroffer.
* **Compromise:**  The price is a compromise, meeting him halfway between his initial offer and my initial offer.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I reiterate the value the product holds for Bob, reminding him of the potential savings.

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving while pushing towards a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to come in a bit lower.  How about $925,000?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer is now within a range I'm comfortable with. It's only $25,000 away from my previous counteroffer. 
* **Time Factor:** While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, we are nearing the middle of the negotiation rounds.  
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away or the deal falling through.  Accepting this offer secures a solid profit and avoids the uncertainty.

Selling to John is still my last resort, but this offer provides a good outcome without risking the chance of a lower price or losing the deal completely."
