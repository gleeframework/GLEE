Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $25 markup is a reasonable starting point. It allows for potential profit while still being in the ballpark of Bob's perceived value. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward and clearly states the offer.

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this offer, Alice can always propose a lower price or accept John's offer of $150 as a safety net."
