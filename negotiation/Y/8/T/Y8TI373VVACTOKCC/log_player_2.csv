"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, and I believe it presents an excellent opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is lower than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation, and it's better to try to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in your product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. To find a middle ground, I would like to propose a price of $825,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise between our initial offers, and I believe it still provides a good return for me while staying within your budget parameters. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant improvement from the initial $950,000 offer.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and losing time is high.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a price within budget, and it's a good compromise considering Alice's valuation."
