"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in your product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. To find a middle ground, I would like to propose a price of $825,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise between our initial offers, and I believe it still provides a good return for me while staying within your budget parameters.",825000.0,Alice,3,
