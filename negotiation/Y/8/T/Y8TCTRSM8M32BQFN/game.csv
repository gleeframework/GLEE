"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $20000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value and potential benefits to you. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $17000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $17000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $18500?  This gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",18500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $18500 is still a little higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $18000. This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.",18000.0,Bob,4,
