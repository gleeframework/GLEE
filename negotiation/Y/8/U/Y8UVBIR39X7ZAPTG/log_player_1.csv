Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This is a strategic starting point:

* **Above Bob's value but below your minimum:** This sets a price point where Bob might be tempted to negotiate, but it's still profitable for you. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** This gives Bob a sense that you're willing to compromise, making him more likely to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Doesn't immediately jump to your minimum:** This shows you're open to finding a mutually beneficial price, rather than just trying to squeeze the maximum out of Bob.

Remember, the key is to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation while also ensuring you don't undervalue the product. You can adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum value ($15,000).** Accepting it would result in a significant loss for you.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  Bob is interested in the product, but you have leverage to push for a higher price.
* **Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit, but it might be too quick.**  You could potentially get closer to your minimum value by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

You should make a counteroffer to Bob.  Try a price between $11,000 and $12,000. This shows you're willing to compromise but still want to make a good profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $11,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. How about $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, but still below it.** While $10,250 is a decent amount, you can likely still squeeze a bit more out of the negotiation.
* **Selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, but you're close.** You've already invested time in negotiating with Bob and you might be able to reach a mutually acceptable price that's closer to your desired value.

**Next Steps:**

You should make another counteroffer. Try something like $10,750. This shows you're willing to compromise, but you're also not willing to let Bob dictate the price entirely."
