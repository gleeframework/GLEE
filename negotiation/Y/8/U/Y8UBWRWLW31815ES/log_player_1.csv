Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a great price of $200. I think you'll find it's a steal at this rate."", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's initial reaction to this high price will give you insight into how much he values the product and how willing he is to negotiate.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have John as a backup, guaranteeing you at least $150. This allows you to be firmer in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $120 is above his perceived value of the product ($80). This suggests there's room for further negotiation.
* **Below Your Minimum:** Accepting $120 would be selling yourself short. You know you have a guaranteed $150 from John.
* **Aiming Higher:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and encourage him to potentially increase his offer closer to your range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you coming up.  However, I'm looking for something closer to $180 for this.  It's really high quality, and I'm confident you'd get a lot of use out of it."", ""product_price"": 180}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):** This counteroffer splits the difference between your initial offer ($200) and Bob's offer ($120). It shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Justification:** Providing a brief reason emphasizing the product's value can make the higher price more palatable. 
* **Leaving Room:** You're still leaving some negotiating room in case Bob counters again, but you're moving closer to your guaranteed sale price with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product is high quality, but I'm on a budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $150. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Matches John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $150 matches what John is willing to pay. There's no benefit to further negotiation with Bob. 
* **Time Saved:** Accepting now saves you the time and effort of another round of negotiation, which might not yield a significantly better outcome.
* **Certainty:** A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. You have a sure sale at your desired price."
