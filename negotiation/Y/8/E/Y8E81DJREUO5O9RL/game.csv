"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
