Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. I am willing to pay up to $1,250,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also aware of John's offer, which gives me a solid baseline."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to accept your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. I'm hoping we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not at a point where I'm comfortable accepting it.  I'm going to take John's offer and sell the product for $1,500,000. This guarantees me the minimum value I'm looking for and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
