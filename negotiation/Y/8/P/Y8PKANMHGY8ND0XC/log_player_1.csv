{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point, maximizing my potential profit while remaining competitive for Bob. It leaves room for negotiation if he counteroffers, but I still have the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,800 is a good offer, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this deal work for me. How about $9,200? That's a significant discount from my original offer, and it leaves some room for us both to be happy."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, and I appreciate the discount. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price and still a good deal for him. Accepting his offer allows me to avoid further negotiation and potential delays while still securing a profitable sale."
