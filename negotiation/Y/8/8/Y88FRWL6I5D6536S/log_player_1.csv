Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Offering a price of $120 signals that you are open to negotiation and willing to potentially lower the price. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer will help you understand how interested Bob is in the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below both your minimum price ($80) and his own perceived value of the product ($80). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this low offer, you signal that you're looking for a fairer deal. 

Let's counter with a price closer to your target while still leaving some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $60 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Could you do $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet in the Middle:** By countering with $100, we're moving closer to a price that's acceptable to both parties.  This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price above our minimum.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  We haven't dropped our price drastically, which shows we believe in the value of our product.
* **Encourage a Counteroffer:** This counteroffer encourages Bob to either accept a price closer to our target or propose a counteroffer that reveals more about his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $60 was a bit low, but $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, $70 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $80. You have a guaranteed offer from John at $80, so there's no need to settle for less. 

Let's make one final counteroffer that's closer to your minimum. This will prompt Bob to either meet your price or walk away, allowing you to proceed with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  My final offer is $85.  This is a great deal on a product I know you'll value."", 
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is your final offer, you create a sense of urgency and signal that you're firm on this price.
* **Justification:** Briefly reiterate the product's value to make the price more palatable.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer is:
    * Above your minimum ($80), ensuring a profit if accepted.
    * Attractive compared to potentially restarting negotiations with another buyer.
    *  Gives Bob a final chance to make a decision.

This strategy aims to either secure a favorable deal with Bob or allow you to proceed confidently with selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still unwilling to meet your minimum price of $80, even after multiple rounds of negotiation.  It's unlikely he'll go higher. You have a guaranteed offer from John at $80. It's time to cut off further negotiation with Bob and secure your guaranteed profit with John."
