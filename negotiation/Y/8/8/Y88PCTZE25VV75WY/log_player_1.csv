Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but the value this product holds goes far beyond $800,000. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm confident this offer reflects a more accurate valuation while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this level. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing at too slow a pace. It's unlikely we'll reach a price that's significantly higher than his current offer of $1,200,000. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the safer and more profitable option at this point."
