"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to ensure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $775,000. I believe this price reflects a fair value for the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Can you consider this offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're committed to finding a price that works for both of us. While $775,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. Let's meet at $790,000. This price would allow me to move forward with the sale while still reflecting the value of the product. What do you think?",790000.0,Alice,5,
