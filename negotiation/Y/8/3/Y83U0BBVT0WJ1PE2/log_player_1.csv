Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1,250,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,150,000, which is $1,200,000. Can we discuss this?

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a higher price, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,200,000 secures a significant profit above my minimum ($1,000,000) and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
