{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's initial offer is good, but there's still room for negotiation. It's best to see if you can get a lower price by counteroffering."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession by offering it to you for $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to my target price, but I still think there's room for more negotiation. It's worth seeing if I can get a lower price before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit higher than where I want to be. How about $1,050,000? That's a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I'm counteroffering at $1,080,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and it's only $30,000 higher than my last counteroffer. While I'd love to get it for even less, the risk of her walking away and me having to buy from John at a much higher price is too great.  It's time to accept and secure the deal."
