{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value.  It allows room for bargaining while still setting a high starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $11,500?  I think it's a fair price considering the value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, but I can't go any lower.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit too high at $12,500, but I'm willing to go to $12,250.  This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to go with John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's final offer of $12,250 is just above my minimum of $12,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing him to John."
