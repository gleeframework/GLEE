"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",999000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not willing to go above that.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to accept $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm making a new counteroffer of $875000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still looking for a compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $915000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",915000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already gone as low as I can, and I'm not willing to go above $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far.",900000.0,Bob,6,
