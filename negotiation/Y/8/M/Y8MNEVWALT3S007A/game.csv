"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. This is a unique asset, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe $900,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000? This reflects the product's true worth and ensures a mutually beneficial deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
