Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While we still have rounds to negotiate, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $925,000 ensures a significant profit over John's offer ($800,000) and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing a significant amount by continuing to negotiate."
