Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, which might incentivize him to accept. 

I'm aiming to strike a balance between getting a good price and ensuring Bob doesn't walk away immediately. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether it's worthwhile to continue negotiating or to simply sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John would guarantee me $12,000, I'm not ready to give up on the potential for a better deal with Bob.

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750. This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit closer to what I need. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price by $250 from my initial counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise and demonstrates good faith in the negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the ""great deal"" it represents for Bob to make him more inclined to accept. 
* **Finality:** I'm also hinting at this being a closer to my final offer. This might push Bob to think seriously about accepting.

This counteroffer gives me a chance to see if Bob is truly committed to a deal or if he's just trying to bargain down as much as possible. If he rejects again, I'll need to weigh the risks of continuing to negotiate versus selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still slightly above what I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to pay $10,250 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $10,250 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  While I've been willing to negotiate, it seems like Bob is determined to pay as little as possible.  Further negotiation is unlikely to get me significantly closer to my desired price.
* **Guarantee:**  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might not lead to a successful outcome.

At this point, it's more advantageous to secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John.  While I would prefer a higher price, continuing to negotiate with Bob carries too much risk of ending up with a lower offer or a stalemate."
