"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree that the product is great, but I think $900,000 is a bit high. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $825,000. This is a good compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
