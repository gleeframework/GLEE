"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Could you do $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and I think you'll find it a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,200,000. Would you consider $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're close to the value you have in mind, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
