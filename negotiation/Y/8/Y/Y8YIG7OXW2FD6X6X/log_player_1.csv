This is a tough decision, as Bob's offer is close to what I'd like to get. However, I've reached the final round, and I'm concerned that further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price.  Given that I can sell to John for $1,200,000, I'm going to take that deal and ensure a much larger profit."
