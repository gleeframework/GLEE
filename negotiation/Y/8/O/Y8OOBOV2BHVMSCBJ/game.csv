"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in buying, but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12500 is still more than I can comfortably afford right now. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm sticking to my previous offer of $8000.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $8000, but I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $10000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's worth considering.",10000.0,Alice,5,
