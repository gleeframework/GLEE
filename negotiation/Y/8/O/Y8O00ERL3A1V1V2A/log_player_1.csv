{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer represents a good starting point. It's above my minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob accepts, great!  If he rejects, I'm prepared to counter-offer or even sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $950,000? It's a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $920,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $920,000 is very close to my target price. While I would love to get closer to $950,000,  it's clear that Bob is not willing to go higher. I'm willing to accept his offer and close this deal. It's a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
