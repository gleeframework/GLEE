"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get close to the product's value to Bob.  However, I'm leaving room for negotiation, as I'm aware of John's offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm raising my offer slightly to $13,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be acceptable to him. It's important to move closer to Bob's offer while still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's not my ideal price, it's only slightly below my minimum and significantly higher than John's offer. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing a deal altogether."
