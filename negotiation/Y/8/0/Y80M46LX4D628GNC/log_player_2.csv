# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm asking for $120. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
