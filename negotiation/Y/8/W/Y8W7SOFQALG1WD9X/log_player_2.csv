"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,800,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $1,200,000.  He should counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price."

While $1,400,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his maximum of $1,200,000.  He should reject and counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his limit."
