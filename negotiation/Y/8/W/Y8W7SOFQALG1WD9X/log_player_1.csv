Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,800,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it, recognizing its worth. I hope this is a reasonable starting point for us.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,400,000?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,400,000 is still above my budget. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product, which is closer to my maximum limit. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.

You have three options:

Bob is unlikely to move much higher than $1,100,000.  It's time to cut losses and take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
