"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm afraid $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $18000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose a price of $14000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. Let's try $16500. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and my minimum price. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $16500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $13500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm getting close to my limit, so I'd appreciate it if you could meet me at this price.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at a lower price, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $13500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $16000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and my needs. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet your minimum price, but $16000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make a final offer of $14000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from another seller. I'm willing to walk away if it's not a fair deal for me.",14000.0,Bob,8,
