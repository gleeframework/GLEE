,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $120.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $105. It's a fair price considering your value of the product is $80 and my maximum is $120. What do you say?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. I can see you're serious about getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $107.50. It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll be happy with it too.",107.5,Alice,5,
