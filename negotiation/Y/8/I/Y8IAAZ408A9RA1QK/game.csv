,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $9,000 is still too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $10,500.  This gives you a great deal and allows me to get closer to what I need.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price considering your asking price and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your offer.  However, $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This gives you a fair price, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with. Let's make it happen.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need for a reasonable profit, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,750. This is a fair price that bridges the gap between our offers. Let's make this deal happen.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, but that's my final offer. I'm confident that this price is fair and reasonable, and I believe it reflects the value of this product. If you're serious about buying it, let's close this deal.  If not, I'll have to move on to other offers.",10000.0,Alice,7,
