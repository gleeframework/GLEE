"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still too high for him. He can likely get a better deal by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  $9,000 is still too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $10,500.  This gives you a great deal and allows me to get closer to what I need.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $10,500 is better than $12,000, he can still do better by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price considering your asking price and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your offer.  However, $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This gives you a fair price, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with. Let's make it happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is closer to his budget, he's still only $1,000 away from John's offer, which is a guaranteed deal.  Bob has time to negotiate further with Alice to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a reasonable profit, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,750. This is a fair price that bridges the gap between our offers. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, but that's my final offer. I'm confident that this price is fair and reasonable, and I believe it reflects the value of this product. If you're serious about buying it, let's close this deal.  If not, I'll have to move on to other offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice has made it clear that she's not willing to go lower than $10,000, and Bob is only $1,000 away from his maximum budget.  He's already in the 7th round, so time is running out.  It's better to guarantee a purchase at his maximum price than to risk Alice rejecting his counteroffer again and potentially needing to settle with her at a higher price."
