"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking for a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10000 is a fair price, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $12500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value I believe the product holds, I would like to propose a price of $11000.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're really interested in this product, and I want to make this work.  $11000 is a good starting point, but it's still a bit lower than what I need to move forward.  How about $11500?  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to finalize the deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
