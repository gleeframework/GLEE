"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is still a significant amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $850,000 is the lowest I can go. This product is truly valuable and I believe it will generate a strong return for you."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  If we can agree on that, I'm ready to buy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This is a good deal for me. I've secured my minimum price, and I'm confident Bob will be happy with the product."
