"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $850,000 is the lowest I can go. This product is truly valuable and I believe it will generate a strong return for you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  If we can agree on that, I'm ready to buy.",800000.0,Bob,4,
