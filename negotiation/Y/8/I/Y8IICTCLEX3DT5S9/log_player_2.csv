"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$75 is a good price, but it's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower.  I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal and hopefully encourages her to come down a bit.  I'll see how she responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $65, which is a good price for me. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she might reject my counteroffer again and I'd be forced to buy from John at a much higher price. It's better to lock in this deal at a reasonable price."
