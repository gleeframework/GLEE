"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,200. That's a fair price considering the value of the product and my own costs. Let me know what you think.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $8,200 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $7,800 for it. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $7,800 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $8,000. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",8000.0,Alice,5,
