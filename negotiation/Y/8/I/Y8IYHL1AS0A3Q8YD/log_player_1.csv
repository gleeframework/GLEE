It's worth trying to get a better price from Bob.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired $11,500."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and try one more counter-offer before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue discussing this.  $10,500 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference at $10,650?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10650}
