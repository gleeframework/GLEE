"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your pricing, but I would like to propose a lower price of $10,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $10,000 is a good price, it's a bit lower than I can accept right now.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800, which is still a great deal for you given the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with $10,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous discussions.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue discussing this.  $10,500 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference at $10,650?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal.",10650.0,Alice,5,
