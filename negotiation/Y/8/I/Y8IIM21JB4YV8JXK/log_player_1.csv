Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price, even if vague, can make it seem more reasonable to the buyer.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** Ending with a question encourages Bob to respond and keeps the conversation flowing. 

While we know Bob values the product at $120, we don't want to start there. This initial offer aims to maximize potential profit while still being within a reasonable range. If Bob rejects this offer, we can always lower it slightly or move to John, ensuring we get at least our minimum price."
