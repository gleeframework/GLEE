Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I'm highlighting the fact that the product is worth $150 to him, making it clear that this is a good deal for him.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending the message with an open-ended question, indicating that I'm willing to negotiate further. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** Starting high gives me the best chance of getting a higher price.
* **Maintain a good relationship:** Being open to negotiation shows Bob that I'm reasonable and willing to work with him.
* **Ensure a sale:**  If Bob rejects my initial offer, I can always make a counteroffer or sell to John, so there's no risk of losing the sale completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $110 is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'll be forced to sell to John for $80. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a good price, and avoids the risk of a longer negotiation."
