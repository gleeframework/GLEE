Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's a [brief description of the product, without revealing too much about its value to you]. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss it further. "", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $15,000. This is a price that's higher than my minimum value of $12,000, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is designed to pique Bob's interest without revealing too much about the product's value. It's important to sound enthusiastic and confident, but also leave room for negotiation.  

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize potential profit:** $15,000 is a good starting point to potentially get more than my minimum value.
* **Avoid ""too low"" offer:**  If I offer too low, Bob might think the product is not worth much and walk away, leaving me with only the $12,000 from John.
* **Open negotiation:** The message invites Bob to discuss the price, allowing for a potential negotiation and finding a mutually agreeable value. 

**Important note:** This is just a starting point. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and any information I gather about his interest and budget."
