"Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling this product. I think it's quite valuable, and I wouldn't let it go for anything less than $200. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $175 for it.",175.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand it's a bit of an investment, but I believe the value is truly there. How about we meet in the middle at $185?",185.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we try $170? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer.",170.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $170 is getting close to my absolute bottom line.  How about we split the difference again and say $177?  This is me trying to find a fair deal for both of us.",177.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a fair deal, and I appreciate that. However, $177 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $172, but that's as high as I can go.",172.0,Bob,6,
