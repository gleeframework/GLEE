Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum. I know Bob values the product at $800,000, so this price is a significant jump. I'm aiming to see if I can negotiate down from there. It's a high price, but if Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to pay something closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I value the product at. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm countering with $1,500,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm not sure I can get closer to my desired price.  While I want to maximize my earnings,  it's not worth risking a lower offer from Bob. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value."
