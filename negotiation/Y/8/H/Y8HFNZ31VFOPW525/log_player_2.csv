"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll be a great owner. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above Bob's maximum price of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price and potentially save more money.  While buying from John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed option, Bob might be able to get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I need to make a profit, and $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,175,000. Let me know if that works for you.

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,175,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $1,000,000.  Bob can potentially save more money by continuing to negotiate and making another counteroffer.  While buying from John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed option, Bob might be able to get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm happy to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $1,150,000 is still above Bob's maximum price of $1,000,000.  At this point, Bob has two options:

* **Continue negotiating:**  This could lead to a lower price, but there's no guarantee. It's also possible that Alice will walk away from the deal.
* **Buy from John:** This is a guaranteed option at Bob's maximum price.

Given that Alice has already rejected Bob's last counteroffer, it's likely she won't budge further. Therefore, the best course of action for Bob is to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. It guarantees him the product at his desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
