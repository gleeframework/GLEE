"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Since the product is worth the same amount to Bob from both Alice and John, and Bob's goal is to save money, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. Buying from John is the same price, but it gives Bob the option to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice in the future if she becomes more motivated to sell."
