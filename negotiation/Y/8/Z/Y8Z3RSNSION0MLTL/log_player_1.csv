Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm taking a risk, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he rejects this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'm going to try to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer with something closer to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my initial offer but still below my initial ask.  Hopefully, this counteroffer will tempt Bob enough to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is higher than what I could get from John, and it's a reasonable compromise.  I'll accept his offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation."
