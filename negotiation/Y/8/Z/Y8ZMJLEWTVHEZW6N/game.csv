"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a fair price considering its value to you.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $90?  It's a fair price considering it's worth $100 to me, and I'm sure we can work something out.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $110? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $105? It's closer to what I'm willing to pay, and it's still a decent deal for you.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm getting close to my minimum price. How about we meet at $108? It's still a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $108 is still a little more than I want to pay.  I'm happy to close the deal at $105.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to both get what we want.",105.0,Bob,6,
