"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a good value, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider this revised offer?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to come closer, but $10,250 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to sell the product for $10,375.  This is a good deal for both of us, and hopefully, we can finally close this deal.",10375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $10,300, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price?",10300.0,Bob,6,
