"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique and valuable item I'd like to offer you. I'm looking to sell it to you for $150. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really appreciate. Is this something you're interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $150 and Alice is offering the product at that price, it makes sense to accept the offer. There's no benefit to rejecting and then buying from John at the same price."
