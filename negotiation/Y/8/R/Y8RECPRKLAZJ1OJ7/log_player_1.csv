Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but not excessively high. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested but wants a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$80 is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer to see if we can reach a price closer to my starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering a price of $120. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value. I hope this counteroffer is appealing enough for Bob to consider while still being fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $90 is still below my ideal price, it's now above my minimum value and the negotiations seem to be stalling.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a sale and avoid further back-and-forth."
