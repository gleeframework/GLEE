"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's offer is $100.  There's still room for negotiation to get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get it closer to your target of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price of $90, which is halfway between Alice's offer of $100 and my maximum price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, giving Alice some room to counter while still saving me money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is still within my budget and significantly cheaper than buying from John for $120.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject again and I'd be forced to buy from John. It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price now."
