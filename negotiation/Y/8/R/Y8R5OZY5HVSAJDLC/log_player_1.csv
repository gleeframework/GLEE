"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation. This allows for potential compromise while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. That's my best offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing negotiations. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for some room for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $750,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $800,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same price I can get from John. There's no need to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially lose out on the deal."
