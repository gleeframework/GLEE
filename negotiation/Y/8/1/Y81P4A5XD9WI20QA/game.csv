"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,000,000 price point. Would you consider reducing the price to $950,000? This would allow me to make a fair assessment of the investment without exceeding my financial limits.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. While I'm eager to work with you, $950,000 is still a bit below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This leaves a good margin for both of us and ensures a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I value your willingness to negotiate. However, due to my financial limitations, I can't agree to $975,000. Could you consider bringing the price down to $925,000? This would be closer to what I'm comfortable committing to.",925000.0,Bob,4,
