Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value. This allows room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but it's still above my minimum and leaves room for potential agreement.  I'm trying to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is only slightly below my minimum value of $10,000, and I want to avoid risking losing the deal completely.  I'm willing to accept this price to secure the sale."
