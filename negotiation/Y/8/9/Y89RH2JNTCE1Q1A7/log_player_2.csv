Don't miss out on this chance to elevate your experience with our top-tier offering. If you're interested, please let us know, and we'll proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's message is trying to inflate the product's value to you. While her offer of $14,000 is under your $15,000 maximum, you know you have a guaranteed option with John at $15,000. There's room to negotiate a better price with Alice or see if she counters your rejection with a lower price."
