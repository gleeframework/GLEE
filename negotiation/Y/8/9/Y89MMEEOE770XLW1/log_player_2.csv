Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm confident it's worth a significant investment.  To kick things off, I'm offering it to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob is trying to secure a lower price by starting with a significant counteroffer. This strategy aims to establish a negotiating range and hopefully reach a compromise within the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $13,000 is still a bit too high for me though. I'm willing to go to $12,500, which is closer to the middle ground we're both aiming for. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to slowly work his way up from his initial counteroffer. By offering $12,500, he's showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to keep the price lower. This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving towards a mutually acceptable price."
