"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $12000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $12000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8000, which is the maximum I can afford.  This price reflects the product's worth to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $11000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you while also being fair to me.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $11000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8000. This price reflects the product's value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let's find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll come down to $10000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this price is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $8000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10000.0,Alice,5,
