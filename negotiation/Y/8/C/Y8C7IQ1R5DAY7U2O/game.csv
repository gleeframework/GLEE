"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $95 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet at $105. I would like to propose $100 as the price for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",100.0,Bob,4,
