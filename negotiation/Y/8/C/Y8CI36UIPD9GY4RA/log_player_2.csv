"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for cheaper than $900,000 from Alice, and you have a better deal available at $1,200,000 from John. So, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than what the product is worth to her ($800,000). This gives Alice room to negotiate while still offering a good deal for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $850,000 is a good price. It's lower than your maximum budget and also a good compromise considering Alice rejected your previous offer.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower price, and you risk losing the deal.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
