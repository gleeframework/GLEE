Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a discounted price of $14,000. I think it would be a great deal for you, considering its value."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($12,000) as possible while still securing a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for my minimum price.

This strategy balances risk and reward for the highest potential profit."
