"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is far too high.  It's important to negotiate a much better price and work our way closer to my $12,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is far below its value. I could come down to $17,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $17,000 is still much higher than my $12,000 walk-away point.  I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. I can go up to $10,000. That's a significant increase from my last offer and demonstrates my serious interest."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $10,000 is still quite low. How about we meet in the middle at $15,500? That's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer, but $15,500 is still above my maximum budget. I need to hold firm and see if I can negotiate her down closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $15,500 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  Could you do $11,500? That would be a great spot for us to land."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
