,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1200000 is simply not a viable price for me.  This product has significant value, and I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we meet in the middle at $1500000?  This would allow both of us to walk away with a fair deal.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. How about we meet at $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1000000 is significantly below the product's value.  Let's try $1300000. This price reflects a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
