{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $130 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message and a price that's slightly higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay close to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being flexible.  $130 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm happy to pay $115, which would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $115 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $115 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $122.50?  That's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 122.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $122.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $118.75? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$118.75 is a good compromise and still gives me a decent profit. I'm happy to accept Bob's offer."
