"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a great deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $8,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings.",8500.0,Alice,5,
