"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and your potential profit.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your position, we would like to respectfully decline that offer. We believe in the value of our product and are committed to achieving a mutually beneficial agreement. Therefore, we are proposing a new price of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still higher than I'd like to pay.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000?  This would give you a good profit margin while still being a fair price for me.",875000.0,Bob,4,
