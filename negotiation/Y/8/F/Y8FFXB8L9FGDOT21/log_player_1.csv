{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product for $140. This is a price that is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for potential negotiation.  I'm also adding a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 
I'm lowering my price to $135, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm also including a message that emphasizes the value of the product and encourages further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $130.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $130 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $132. This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 132}
``` 

I'm offering a price of $132, which is closer to Bob's offer and within my acceptable range. I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to accept and highlight the ""fairness"" of the price."
