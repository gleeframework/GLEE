"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is a good middle ground. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum. This gives room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm currently looking for a more affordable option. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm open to negotiating, $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This gives you a good deal, and allows me to make some profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum of $15,000. While I'd prefer more, it's a decent deal and avoids the risk of him backing out completely or me having to sell to John for $15,000.  I'm willing to accept this offer."
