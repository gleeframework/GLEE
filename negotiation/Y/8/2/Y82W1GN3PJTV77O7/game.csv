"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and above my minimum asking price.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a price around $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $850,000. This still offers you a significant profit margin, and it's closer to my own valuation of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $800,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
