"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it.  Let me know if that's a price we can work with.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1100000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit below what I believe the product's worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $1300000.  How about $1250000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
