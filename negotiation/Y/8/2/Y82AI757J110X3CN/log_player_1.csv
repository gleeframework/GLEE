"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. To start, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a substantial offer considering my maximum budget and represents a significant starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,800,000 is still beyond my acceptable range.  Let's try $1,200,000. This is a reasonable compromise, reflecting the product's value while staying within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but we are still significantly below John's offer. It's worth another counteroffer to see if we can push Bob closer to at least $1,400,000 before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To meet you closer to your budget, I propose $1,600,000.  This is a significant price reduction on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. While $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has reached $1,400,000 which is a reasonable gain over John's offer considering the remaining rounds.  It's unlikely Bob will reach $1,500,000, and there's a risk he stops negotiating altogether in later rounds. Accepting now secures a solid profit."
