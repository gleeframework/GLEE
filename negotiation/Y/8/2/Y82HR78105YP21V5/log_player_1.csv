Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your baseline:** You have a guaranteed offer of $15,000 from John, so you don't want to sell for less than that.
* **Aiming high:** Starting with a higher offer ($19,000) leaves room for negotiation. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're still likely to get a better price than John's offer.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies high demand and value, which might make Bob more inclined to accept the offer or negotiate around the higher price rather than outright rejecting it."
