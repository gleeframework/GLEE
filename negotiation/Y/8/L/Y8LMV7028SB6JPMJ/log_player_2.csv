Bob should reject the offer.  $90 is still too high for him. He can try to get a better price by counteroffering."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a bit lower than her previous offer, it's still above his target price.  He should counteroffer again to see if he can get closer to his desired price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $95. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer you $94. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $94

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $120. While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's target price of $80. Since he's willing to pay up to $120 for the product, buying from John is the best option in this situation.  He saves money compared to accepting Alice's latest offer and avoids further negotiation."
