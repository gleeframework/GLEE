{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $100. It's a steal, considering its value! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point. It's a little lower than your minimum value ($120) but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows you're willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. That's the most I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. It's below your minimum value and not worth accepting.  You can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $85. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $85 is closer to your minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still not ideal. It's better to sell to John for $120 and secure a profit that meets your minimum value."
