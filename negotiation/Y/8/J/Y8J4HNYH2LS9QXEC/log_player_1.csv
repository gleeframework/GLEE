"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value of $100. This gives me room to negotiate while still being reasonable. I'm also highlighting the value proposition of the product for Bob, hoping to make him more likely to accept my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is a good offer and better than selling to John, I'm aiming for a higher price closer to my initial $130 offer. I believe that I can still get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. That's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product for you.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $120 was a bit too low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $125. Can you consider $122.50? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial $130 asking price, Bob's offer of $122.50 is a fair compromise.  It's significantly higher than selling to John for $100, and we're already four rounds in. It's time to close the deal."
