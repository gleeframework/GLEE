Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point.  It's well above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value is $1,500,000. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept, you're still better off rejecting and trying to get a higher price.  You can counter with a price closer to your desired range, or risk losing out to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the market value and the potential benefits of this product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This counteroffer is still above Bob's initial offer but significantly lower than your previous offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but also maintains a price point that is closer to your desired value.  It allows for potential for further negotiation if Bob is unwilling to meet you halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits of this product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While you could continue negotiating, there's a real risk that the negotiation will drag on and you'll lose valuable time. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is your target. It's the safest and most profitable option at this point."
