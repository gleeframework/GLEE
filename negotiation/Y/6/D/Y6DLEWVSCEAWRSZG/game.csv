"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $15,000 to me. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you can consider.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a great price for a product worth $15,000 to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to you, I believe $12,500 would be a fair price for both parties. Let me know if this is something you can consider.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $12,500 is closer to what I'm looking for. However, I'm still holding out for a slightly better price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? This gives us both a good deal.",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I'd like to propose $13,000 as a compromise. It's higher than my initial offer but still lower than your last proposal. Let's aim for a win-win solution.",13000.0,Bob,6,
