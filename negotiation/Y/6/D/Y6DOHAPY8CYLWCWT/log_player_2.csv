"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm interested in your product, but I'd like to start with a counteroffer of $750,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $200,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating but also gives room for negotiation.
* **Framing:** I've framed the counteroffer as a starting point for further discussion, emphasizing that I'm still interested. 
* **Focus on Value:** I've highlighted the product's value to me, indicating that I'm not just arbitrarily throwing out a number."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still $50,000 over my limit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation, especially since Alice is willing to compromise. I want to see if I can get a better price.
* **John as Leverage:** I have John's offer as a backup, which gives me leverage to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm very close to my budget, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is my final offer, as I have another option available at that price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making this my ""final"" offer, putting pressure on Alice to accept.
* **John as Leverage:** I'm explicitly mentioning my other option (John's offer) to create urgency and demonstrate my commitment to the $800,000 limit.
* **Reasonable Counter:** This offer is a fair compromise, meeting Alice halfway from her previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $800000, but I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for this incredible product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeding Budget:** Alice's offer is still $25,000 over my budget.  
* **Limited Rounds:** We're already halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing this opportunity by continuing to haggle. 
* **John as Safe Option:**  John's offer is a guaranteed deal at my maximum budget. It's a safer choice than continuing to negotiate with Alice, as I risk her rejecting my counteroffer and running out of time."
