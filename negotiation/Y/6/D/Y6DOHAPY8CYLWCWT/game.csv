"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm interested in your product, but I'd like to start with a counteroffer of $750000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm very close to my budget, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. I'm willing to go up to $800000. This is my final offer, as I have another option available at that price. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $800000, but I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for this incredible product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
