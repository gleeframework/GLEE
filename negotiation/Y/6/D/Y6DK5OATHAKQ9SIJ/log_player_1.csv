"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that it's likely Bob will reject it. This is a tactic to gauge his interest and potentially get him to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $16,000, still higher than Bob's offer but showing flexibility. This should encourage further negotiation and hopefully lead to a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is getting closer, I still think I can get a higher price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm further reducing my price to $14,500. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired outcome. It's a reasonable compromise, as I'm only $500 away from my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only four rounds left, the negotiation isn't moving fast enough.  Bob is still too far below my minimum acceptable price, and there's no guarantee he'll come up to my desired amount. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a decent profit and minimizes the risk of losing money by further negotiation."
