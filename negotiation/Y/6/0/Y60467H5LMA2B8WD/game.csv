"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $750000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the product's true value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this incredible product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
