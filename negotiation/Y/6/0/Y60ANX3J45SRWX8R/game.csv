"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I could be flexible to an extent, how about we meet halfway at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your position and I'm trying to find a solution that works for both of us.  $9,000 is still quite low, could you manage $10,000? This would be my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer carefully. Unfortunately, $10,000 is still above my budget. I believe the fair price for this product should be around $9,500. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",9500.0,Bob,6,
