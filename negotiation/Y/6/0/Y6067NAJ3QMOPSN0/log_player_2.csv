"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, accepting Alice's initial offer yields no benefit. It's worth exploring if a lower price is possible before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob wants to save as much money as possible, it's reasonable to start with a significant counteroffer. A $1000 reduction from Alice's initial price is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's target price. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially secure a better deal by rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7300}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible.  While Alice's offer of $7,600 is closer to Bob's goal, it's still too high.  A counteroffer of $7,300 is a reasonable compromise, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $7,500 is a significant improvement from her initial price and is very close to Bob's target price. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that's within his budget and saves him $500 compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of losing the deal with Alice and having to buy from John at a higher price."
