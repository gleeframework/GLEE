"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for your product,  which is a fair price considering its potential value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1750000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still allowing for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1750000 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference and settle on $1375000.  I believe this price is fair considering both our positions and would allow us to close this deal efficiently.",1375000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1375000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This offer is a significant compromise from my initial asking price and should be within your budget.  Let's try to make this deal work.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1600000 is still beyond my budget. To make this deal work, I'm offering $1500000.
