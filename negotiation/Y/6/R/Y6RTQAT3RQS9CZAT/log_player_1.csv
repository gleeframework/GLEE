Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $120, so there's potential for profit above your minimum acceptable price ($80).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with an offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($110 instead of $120) leaves room for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit margin for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $80. This allows you to aim higher with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could start with a higher price and see if Bob is willing to pay it. However, this approach balances risk and reward effectively."
