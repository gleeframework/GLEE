"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can do better.  While $1,450,000 is less than John's price, Bob has 10 rounds to try and get a better price from Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and see if he can get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within his budget.  This demonstrates to Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also looking for a good deal.  Offering $1,300,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, giving Alice some room to negotiate while still leaving Bob room to go lower if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price, but it's getting closer.  Bob should continue to negotiate.  He has 7 more rounds and can likely push Alice down further.  He's also still within his budget, so there's no immediate risk of going over his limit.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob the opportunity to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice he's willing to compromise.  $1,350,000 is still a good deal for Bob, but also gives Alice some room to negotiate without losing too much.  This strategy continues to demonstrate Bob's serious interest in the product while pushing for a better price."
