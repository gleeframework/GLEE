"Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $105 is still a bit low for me.  How about we settle at $110? That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down a little more, but $107 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference and go with $108.  How does that sound?",108.0,Alice,5,
