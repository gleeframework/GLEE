"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above what the product is worth to Bob ($800,000) and above what I would accept from John ($1,000,000). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a great opportunity for Bob, highlighting the product's value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not setting a hardline price. This allows for a back-and-forth and potentially a better outcome than simply accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm a bit constrained by my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but I want to see if I can do better with Bob.
* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is a decent start but still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's room to negotiate higher. By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my target while still keeping the deal open with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $900,000 is a step in the right direction, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work.  This product is truly exceptional, and I believe it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving room for negotiation. $1,100,000 is a compromise that demonstrates I'm willing to work with him while still securing a profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to reinforce the rationale for a higher price.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the negotiation as a win-win situation for both of us. This helps maintain a positive tone and builds trust."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I still think $950,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  I'm still aiming for the highest possible profit. 
* **Bob's Offer:**  $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below $1,000,000, which is what John is offering.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for a small increase.  I'm not in a rush, and I can potentially secure a better deal with Bob. 
* **Avoiding Risk:**  While $950,000 is tempting, I'm not willing to take the risk of losing out on a potentially higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your understanding and willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the exceptional value of this product. Let's close this deal and make it a win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:**  I'm making a smaller concession this time, showing that I'm serious about making a deal with Bob.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value and emphasizing the fairness of my offer.
* **Urgency:**  I'm using language like ""close this deal"" to subtly create a sense of urgency.
* **Win-Win:**  I'm still framing the deal as a win for both of us, reinforcing the positive tone of the negotiation. 

**This counteroffer keeps me above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 while still being a reasonable compromise for Bob.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to get as close to my budget as possible. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product, which is the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are halfway through the negotiation rounds, and there is a risk of running out of time before reaching a mutually agreeable price.
* **Bob's Limits:** Bob has repeatedly stated that he is working within a tight budget. While his offer is close to my minimum, it's not enough to justify the risk of further negotiations.
* **John's Guarantee:** Selling to John provides a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and a safer option given the limited time remaining.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** Continued negotiations could lead to a stalemate or a lower price for me. It's best to secure the guaranteed offer from John."
