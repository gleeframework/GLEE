"Thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I can meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  How about $95? That's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, but I'm not ready to give up on getting the price I want. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
