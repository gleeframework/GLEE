Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant returns you'll gain. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, starting high anchors the negotiation in your favor.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Offering at $1,150,000 gives Bob the impression of a potential deal and allows room for you to potentially negotiate down slightly while still remaining above your minimum.
* **Highlighting value:** The message focuses on the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price to Bob. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. You have the advantage of a guaranteed sale, but maximizing your profit might involve some flexibility."
