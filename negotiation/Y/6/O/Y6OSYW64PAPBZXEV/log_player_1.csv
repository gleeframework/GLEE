"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 18000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than Bob. I'm hoping to secure a good price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with that price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to $15,000.  There are still several rounds left, and I think I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

I'm going to make one last counteroffer before considering John's offer.  $14,500 is a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.  If Bob doesn't agree, I'll take the safe route and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's time to cut my losses. Bob is clearly not willing to budge on his offer, and I've already made several concessions.  I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk ending up with a lower price than John's offer. Selling to John is the safest option."
