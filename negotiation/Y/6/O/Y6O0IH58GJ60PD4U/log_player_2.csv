"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own a valuable asset that will bring you significant benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 600000} 
 
**Reasoning:**  Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer gives me more room to negotiate.  I'm aiming to save as much money as possible while still acknowledging Alice's desire for a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but she's still quite far from my ideal price. I'm willing to see if she'll negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice.  I appreciate the willingness to negotiate. How about $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 700000}

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm serious, but I'm still aiming for a price well below her last offer. This keeps the negotiation moving and leaves me room to go up slightly if needed, while staying below my limit with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I can offer you the product for $850,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and her final offer is still above my maximum price with John. It makes more sense to secure the product at my target price by buying from John."
