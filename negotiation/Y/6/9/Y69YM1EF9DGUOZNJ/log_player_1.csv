Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for a higher price, Bob is firmly rooted at $850,000. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit above my minimum ($800,000) and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation or losing him as a buyer altogether."
