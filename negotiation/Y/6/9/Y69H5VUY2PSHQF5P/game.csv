"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to get closer to the value I'm looking for.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $13,000? That's still a significant saving for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $13,000, so how about $12,200?",12200.0,Bob,4,
