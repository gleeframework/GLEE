"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! However, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to buy it for $100.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though! Would you be interested in buying the product for $145?",145.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. $145 is closer, but I'm still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  This is my final offer.",125.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"I'm sorry to hear that $125 is your final offer, Bob. I'm not comfortable selling the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $140 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $137.50?",137.5,Alice,5,,
