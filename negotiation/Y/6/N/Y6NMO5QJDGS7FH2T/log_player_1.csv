Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's common in negotiation to start with a higher price. This gives you room to maneuver and potentially settle at a price higher than your minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** Signaling willingness to negotiate makes Bob feel like he has more control and increases his likelihood of engaging in the conversation.
* **John as Safety Net:** Having John as a backup buyer at $8,000 provides a safety net, allowing you to be more aggressive in your negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I have a chance to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a higher price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can still sell to John for $8,000.

This strategy allows me to try to get closer to my desired price without immediately accepting a price below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $7,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is still a great price for the value you're getting, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer demonstrates willingness to compromise while still being above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the ""great value"" reinforces the product's worth and justifies the price.
* **Fair Compromise:**  Framing it as a ""fair compromise"" suggests a meeting point and increases the likelihood of Bob accepting.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  Ending with ""Let me know what you think"" keeps the door open for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $7500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $7,500 is close to my minimum of $8,000, but it's still below it.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While I could counteroffer again, there's a risk that Bob might continue to lower his offer, and I might end up with a price I'm not happy with.
* **Guaranteed deal with John:** Selling to John guarantees me $8,000, which is above my minimum and secures a sale without further negotiation.

Given the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially resulting in a lower price, it's more prudent to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed profit."
