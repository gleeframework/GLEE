Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting at $12,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This gives Bob room to negotiate but also leaves me a good profit margin.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 

**Strategy:**

This is a strategic starting point. I'm trying to maximize my profit, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation to avoid losing Bob as a buyer entirely. By setting a price higher than Bob's perceived value, I'm hoping to motivate him to counter-offer, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. This is a good starting point because it balances my desire for a high price with the need to keep the negotiation open and avoid simply selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, based on my budget, I am only able to offer $10000 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $12,000. Accepting his offer would result in a major loss. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation. I believe I can get a higher price by counteroffering.  I'll need to consider a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer but still leaves me with a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm open to selling the product to you for $11,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer of $11,500 is significantly higher than Bob's offer of $10,000, but it's lower than my initial offer of $12,000.  It shows I am willing to compromise and provides Bob with a potential deal. 
* **Message:** I'm again focusing on being friendly and positive, reiterating the value of the product for Bob while also emphasizing the fairness of my offer for myself.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Close the gap:**  It brings my price closer to Bob's offer, making a deal more likely.
* **Show flexibility:** It demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Maintain value:** It still gives me a profit, which is crucial since I won't accept anything below my minimum acceptable price.

By focusing on these factors, I hope to reach an agreement with Bob before needing to sell to John for a guaranteed, but potentially lower, profit."
