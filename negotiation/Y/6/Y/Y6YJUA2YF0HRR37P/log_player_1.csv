Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a very competitive offer considering its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's maximum:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so we need to offer a price lower than that for him to even consider it.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While we could start at $999,999, a slightly higher initial offer leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little, making him feel more in control.
* **Highlighting value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to frame Bob's thinking in terms of potential gain rather than just the purchase price. 
* **Backup plan:** We have a strong backup plan with John, ensuring we won't settle for less than our minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

This strategy assumes we have limited information about Bob's negotiation style and risk tolerance. With more information, we could potentially push for a higher price. However, this offer represents a balanced approach to maximize potential profit while minimizing the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
