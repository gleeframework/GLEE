{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 (John's offer).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's valuation maximizes your potential profit. However, being too aggressive (e.g., asking for $990,000) might make Bob reconsider. 
* **The Offer:** Offering the product at $925,000 leaves a significant profit margin for you while still offering Bob a substantial discount compared to his perceived value."
