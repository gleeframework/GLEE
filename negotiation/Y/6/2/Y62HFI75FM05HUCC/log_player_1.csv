Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I can meet you halfway. How about $13,750?"", ""product_price"": 13750}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $13,625? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob is clearly trying to negotiate the best possible price, but his offer is getting close enough to my minimum that it makes sense to accept. Holding out for more risks losing him as a buyer entirely, which would mean accepting the $10,000 offer from John.
