"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1500000 to me.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is less than $1000000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's worth to me is $1500000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to get a better price, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $1100000. I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to save as much as you can, but I'm still not willing to go below $1200000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
