"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal considering its worth to me is significantly higher. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum limit. I'm going to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12,000, but unfortunately, that's still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?  It's still a very good price for you, and it allows me to acquire the product."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to my maximum budget, it's still above my preferred price point. Given that Alice seems unwilling to budge further, I'm choosing to buy the product from John for $8,000. This ensures I stay within my budget and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
