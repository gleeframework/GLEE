"I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal considering its worth to me is significantly higher.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you given its worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the value it brings to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12,000, but unfortunately, that's still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?  It's still a very good price for you, and it allows me to acquire the product.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
