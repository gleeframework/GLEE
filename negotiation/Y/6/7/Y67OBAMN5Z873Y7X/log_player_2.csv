"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay something closer to its market value. How about we start the conversation at $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** My initial offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This tactic establishes a strong negotiating position and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""market value,"" I subtly imply that I've done my research and know the product's worth. This adds weight to my counteroffer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While my initial offer is low, it's not offensively so. It shows Alice that I'm serious about purchasing but expects a fair deal in return."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $600,000 is significantly below its true value, I understand we need to find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,600,000? This reflects the product's unique aspects and potential for return. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit, but $1,600,000 is still far beyond what I had in mind. This product would be valuable to my business, but I need to be realistic about the investment. Would you consider $750,000? This offer reflects my strong interest while acknowledging the need for a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  I'm increasing my offer, but not drastically. This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but not going to be pressured into her initial high price.
* **Focus on Mutually Beneficial:** By highlighting ""mutually beneficial,"" I'm reminding Alice that a successful deal benefits both of us.  She gets a sale, and I get the product. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer is getting closer to my upper limit ($800,000). If Alice rejects this and doesn't move substantially, I may switch to John to avoid wasting time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're still quite far apart on price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to demonstrate my willingness to negotiate, but I need to see you move closer to my valuation as well. Would you consider $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but very slowly. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach an agreement that works for me before I hit my absolute limit.  It makes more sense to cut my losses and buy from John for the guaranteed price of $800,000."
