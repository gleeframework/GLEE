"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,700,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. This is a one-time offer, so act fast! If you decline, I'll be selling it to John for $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering.  It makes the most sense to go with John's deal."
