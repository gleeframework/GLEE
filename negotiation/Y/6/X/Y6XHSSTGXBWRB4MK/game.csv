"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $15,000 to you, and to be fair, I'm initially offering it at $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $9,500 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $10,750? This feels like a fair compromise.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $9,500 again, or even $9,200? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits my budget.",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  $9,200 is too low for me to consider. To make this work, I'm willing to come down slightly to $10,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's more than fair given the product's worth.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $9,800? I think that's a fair compromise given the product's value.",9800.0,Bob,6,
