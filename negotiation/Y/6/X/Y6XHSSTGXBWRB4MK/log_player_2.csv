"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $15,000 to you, and to be fair, I'm initially offering it at $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to negotiate a better price. Since Alice's initial offer was $12,000 and I think the product is worth $8,000 to her, I'll make a counteroffer that's a bit lower than her initial offer.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $9,500 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $10,750? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice is trying to get closer to her original price, but I can still do better than that. I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to get closer to the product's value to Alice, which is $8,000. Since Alice's last offer was $10,750, I'll make a counteroffer that's a bit lower.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $9,500 again, or even $9,200? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits my budget."", ""product_price"": 9200}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  $9,200 is too low for me to consider. To make this work, I'm willing to come down slightly to $10,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's more than fair given the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice is trying to get me to meet her at a price that's still too high for me. I'll reject her offer and try to make one last counteroffer. Since Alice is willing to go up to $10,500, I'll try to meet her halfway, but with a slight discount.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to get as close to the product's value to Alice as possible. Since Alice is willing to go up to $10,500, I'll make a counteroffer that's a bit lower, but still in the same range.

{""message"": ""I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $9,800? I think that's a fair compromise given the product's value."", ""product_price"": 9800}"
