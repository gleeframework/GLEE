"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think it would be very valuable to you, and this is a very competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $100 to you and $80 to Alice.
* Alice's initial offer of $95 is too high. You should try to negotiate a lower price. 
* Since you have 10 rounds, rejecting the offer and counter-offering gives you more leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value of $80.
* This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* You're staying polite and indicating your interest, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down a bit, but $90 is still higher than the price you're willing to pay. 
* You're still within your 10 rounds and have room to continue negotiating.  
* You should aim for a price closer to your $85 counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $90 is closer, but I'm still looking to pay closer to my initial offer of $85.  How about we split the difference at $87.50?"", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  You're showing willingness to compromise, but still trying to get closer to your desired price.
*  Offering a specific amount (87.50) makes the counteroffer more concrete and easier for Alice to consider. 
*  This counteroffer is reasonable, leaving room for potential future negotiation."
