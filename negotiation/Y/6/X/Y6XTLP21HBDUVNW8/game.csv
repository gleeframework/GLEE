"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $7,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $7,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",7200.0,Alice,5,
