(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to tell if $5,000 is a good deal.  Let's see if we can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3000}
```

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer to gauge Alice's interest and see if we can find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but $4,000 is still too high. I'll try to push for a lower price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show good faith, but still aiming for a price significantly below Alice's last offer. Hopefully, this will lead to a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is showing some flexibility, and the price is getting closer to my target.  Accepting this offer is the best option right now.  While I could try for a lower price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk missing out on the product entirely."
