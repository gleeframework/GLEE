{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts by being friendly and highlighting the value of the product. It also provides a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $105. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to try to get closer to that by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $110?  That's still a good deal for you, and gets us closer to a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $108 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to go lower.  It's time to move on to a guaranteed deal with John."
