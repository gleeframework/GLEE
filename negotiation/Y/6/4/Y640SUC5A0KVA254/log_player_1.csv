"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob for the full $1,200,000, my minimum acceptable price. This sets a high bar and forces Bob to negotiate if he wants the product. If he rejects, I can always sell to John for my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I want to close a deal, I'm not willing to sacrifice so much.  I'll reject his offer and see if we can find a middle ground in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000.  This is still above Bob's offer but represents a significant compromise from my initial price.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to come closer to my value."

You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to sell for anything less than $1,000,000. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.  We're getting close, but I'm not ready to give up yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,025,000.  This is just a slight drop from my previous offer, but it shows Bob that I am willing to negotiate and that I am serious about closing a deal.  It's also still above my minimum acceptable price."

We've reached a critical point in the negotiation. While Bob's offer is getting closer, we are running out of rounds.  I'm not willing to compromise any further and risk getting stuck with a lower price.  To secure my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to John."
