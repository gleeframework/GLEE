"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can potentially get a better price from Alice, and he has a safety net with John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still confident that my initial offer was a fair one. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product at a competitive price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's already gotten Alice down to $1,150,000. While it's tempting to accept, he should see if he can get it lower with another counteroffer.  He can always buy from John if the negotiation stalls."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to consider your request. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value of the product to you.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already gotten the price down to $1,100,000, which is a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,500,000.  While he might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, it's unlikely to be worth the risk of losing the deal entirely."
