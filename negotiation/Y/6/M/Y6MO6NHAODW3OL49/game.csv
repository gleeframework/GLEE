"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18000 is out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $15000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last two offers - $13500. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can sell it to you for $14500. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",14500.0,Alice,5,
