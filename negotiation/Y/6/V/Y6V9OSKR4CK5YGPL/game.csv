"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming to the table. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to pay $875,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits us both.",875000.0,Bob,4,
