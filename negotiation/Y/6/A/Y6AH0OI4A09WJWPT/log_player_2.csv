Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a more flexible proposal. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to maintain a reasonable margin for my business. Therefore, I am proposing a price of $825,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with both our interests.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue this discussion. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you slightly closer to your proposed price. My counteroffer is $787,500 for the product. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

At this point, Alice's offer of $787,500 is still higher than John's standing offer of $800,000. It's unlikely Alice will come down significantly further, so it makes more sense to cut your losses and purchase from John."
