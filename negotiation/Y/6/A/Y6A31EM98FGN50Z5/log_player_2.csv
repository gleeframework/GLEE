"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you don't know the value of the product to Alice, there's a possibility she'd be willing to accept a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer at $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me the most leverage in the negotiation. It's likely Alice will reject this, but it establishes a strong starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,100,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but still willing to negotiate. It's a more moderate increase than my first counteroffer, signaling that I'm willing to meet her halfway."
