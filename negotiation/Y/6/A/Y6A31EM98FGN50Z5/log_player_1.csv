"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, and I'm willing to risk losing the deal to John if Bob doesn't see the value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still trying to get a good price.  $1,250,000 is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,100,000 is a good deal and ensures I make a profit.  I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal to John or getting stuck with a lower price."
