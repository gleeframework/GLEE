Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than $80, I can likely do better with a counteroffer.  I still have several rounds to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far off from my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $95 is getting closer, I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price.  I'm not going to rush into a deal this early in the negotiation.  There are still a few rounds to go, and I want to try to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $95 is still a bit low for me. Let's try $105.  It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to stick to my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is getting closer to my minimum of $80, I'm still not happy with the deal.  I'd rather push for a slightly higher price and see if we can reach a compromise.  I'm still confident that I can get a better deal, and I'm willing to continue negotiating for a few more rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $90 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $97.50?  It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 97.5}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to get the best deal I can. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $87.50 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the deal.  I'd rather push for a slightly higher price and see if we can reach a compromise.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $92.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still a good deal for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 92.5}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate all the negotiations we've had, but I've got to make a decision. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. This is my best and final offer. Please let me know if you're willing to accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $80. While I'd prefer to get more from Bob, his final offer of $85 is still too low for me.  Since I only have one round left, and John is willing to pay my minimum, it's the best option for me."
