"Hi Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that holds significant value, and I believe it could be a game-changer for your business.

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'm willing to make an offer of $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $800000 is well below what I'm able to accept. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I receive a fair value for this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering you the product for $1150000. This price reflects the product's true value and allows for room for further negotiation. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I understand that you're looking for a fair value, but I'm still concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value, and I'm open to further negotiations to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to ensure I receive a fair value for this unique product.  I'm willing to come down a little more and offer it to you for $1050000. This price is a compromise, but it's also the lowest I can go while still ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. I'm confident this offer represents a good value for you, and I hope we can reach an agreement. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another offer, but I need to be realistic about the value of the product. I'm offering $975000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and your latest one. I believe this price is fair and reflects the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to move forward with the purchase. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,6,
