Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another offer, but I need to be realistic about the value of the product. I'm offering $975000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and your latest one. I believe this price is fair and reflects the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to move forward with the purchase. What do you think?

Bob's offer is still slightly below my minimum acceptable price.  While we're getting closer, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the sale. John is offering me a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a safe and secure option, even if it's slightly less than what I could potentially get from Bob."
