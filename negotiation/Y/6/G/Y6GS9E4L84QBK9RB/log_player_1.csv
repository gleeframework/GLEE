Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to both parties, starting with a higher offer ($1,500,000) allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit for Alice.
* **Sense of urgency and exclusivity:** By mentioning other interested parties and framing it as a ""limited-time offer,"" Alice creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially motivating Bob to accept the offer quickly.
* **Backup option:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John, so she can afford to start high with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation skills, Alice might need to adjust her asking price."
