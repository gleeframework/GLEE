"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our exclusive product. Given its unique value and potential impact, we believe it's worth $1,200,000 to secure this opportunity. We understand its significance to you and aim to find a mutually beneficial arrangement. Please let us know if this proposal aligns with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, Bob can still do better. He has a backup option of buying from John for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?  I understand the product's worth, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budgetary constraints. In light of this, I am willing to consider your offer. However, to ensure a fair transaction, I propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while staying competitive with your budget. Please let me know if this revised offer meets your requirements.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000. While Bob can still potentially get a better price by rejecting and counteroffering again, it's not guaranteed.  The risk of Alice walking away and Bob having to buy from John at $1,000,000 is significant. Accepting Alice's offer at $1,100,000 is a good compromise and secures the product for a price within Bob's budget."
