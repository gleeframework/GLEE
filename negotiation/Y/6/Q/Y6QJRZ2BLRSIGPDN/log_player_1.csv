"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but significantly lower than my minimum value. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer in a positive light, highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm using language that implies I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $15,000 I can get from John.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price with Bob, considering he's expressed interest in the product. 
* **Exploring options:** I want to see if I can reach a more favorable deal with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value, and it's still a good deal for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** I'm still leaving some room for a potential counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my finances. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's a chance I can still get a higher price from Bob, especially since he's expressed strong interest in the product. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  I'm not ready to give up on getting a price closer to my target just yet.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  $9,500 is closer to what I can do, and it reflects your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a valuable investment. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:**  I'm making a small concession to show flexibility while staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair price that considers both our interests.
* **Focus on value:**  I'm reminding Bob about the value of the product to encourage him to see it as a worthwhile investment.
* **Final offer tone:** I'm hinting that this might be my final offer to incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,250. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my finances. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds. 
* **Reaching a stalemate:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  Further negotiation is unlikely to get me closer to my desired price.
* **Secure a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a profit and eliminates the risk of losing the sale altogether. 
* **Limited upside potential:**  The potential gains from continuing to negotiate with Bob are outweighed by the risk of reaching a deadlock or running out of rounds."
