"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm starting at $150, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price, but not so high as to be immediately unreasonable. This allows me to see if Bob is interested at all and gauge his potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product but $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you consider $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $125 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my ideal price. It's important to note that I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate, and I don't want to settle too early."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
