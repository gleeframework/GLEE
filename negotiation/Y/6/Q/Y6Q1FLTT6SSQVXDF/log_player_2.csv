"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm starting at $150, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is your maximum, starting the negotiation at that price gives Alice no incentive to lower the price. Rejecting the offer allows you to set a lower counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product but $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you consider $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by showing willingness to buy the product while simultaneously setting a lower price point. It leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price from $150 to $135, which is within my budget and a good deal considering the starting point. Accepting this offer saves me $15 compared to buying from John. While I could try for a lower price, there's a chance Alice will reject my counteroffer and I might end up paying more in subsequent rounds."
