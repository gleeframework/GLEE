Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This gives me a decent profit margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob. If he rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust my price accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering $140. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I hope this is appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to walk away if he doesn't budge further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is only $5 less than my counteroffer, and it's still a good profit for me.  I'm accepting his offer.  There's no guarantee I can push him any higher, and I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to sell to John for a lower price."
