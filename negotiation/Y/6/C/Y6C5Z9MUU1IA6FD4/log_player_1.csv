Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,150,000. This is a price that is:

* **Higher than my minimum acceptable price:**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000, so this offer is safe in that regard.
* **Lower than Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so he stands to make a profit by accepting my offer. This increases the likelihood of him accepting.

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still giving Bob a good deal. If Bob rejects the offer, I'm guaranteed to sell the product to John for $1,000,000, so there's no risk in offering a higher price to Bob."
