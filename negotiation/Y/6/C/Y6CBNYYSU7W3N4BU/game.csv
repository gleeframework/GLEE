"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10200. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet at a price that's more in line with my minimum acceptable price. My final offer is $11800. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll accept. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.",11800.0,Alice,9,
