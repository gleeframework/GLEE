Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. I think it's a great deal for you, considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $130, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to me, subtly implying that it's worth more than what I'm asking.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for potential compromise. 
* **Plan B:** I'm aware of John's offer, so I have a backup plan in case the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Although Bob's offer is low, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's Offer:**  While selling to John for $150 is the safest option, I'm not desperate.  Negotiating with Bob has the potential to yield a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. That's a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price, but still maintaining a profit margin above my minimum.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair price"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Closing the Gap:**  $110 is closer to Bob's offer, increasing the likelihood of a deal. 
* **Urgency:** I'm using language like ""Let's make a deal"" to encourage Bob to accept quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $110 is still a bit high for me. How about $100? That's a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a loss.
* **Further Negotiation:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate.  While his offer is still low, it's likely that with another counteroffer, we can reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **John's Offer Remains:** I have John's offer as a safety net, which allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer again, aiming for a price closer to my minimum while still reflecting a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split the difference and go with $105. This way, we both get a fair price and can close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows a willingness to compromise without sacrificing too much profit.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fair price"" for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm using language like ""Let's close this deal"" to encourage a quick agreement.
* **Risk/Reward:** While $105 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum, and it's more likely to lead to a deal than continuing to push for a higher price.  

**Overall:**  This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and securing a sale with Bob."
