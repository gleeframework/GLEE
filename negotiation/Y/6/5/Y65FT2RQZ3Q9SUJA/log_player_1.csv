Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to sell the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I'd like to keep it under $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
