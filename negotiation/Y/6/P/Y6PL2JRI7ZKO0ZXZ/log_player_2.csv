Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,100,000, but I need to be honest with you, if we don't come to an agreement, I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay $800,000. I'm hoping we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to keep the price under $1,000,000, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've already compromised by meeting you halfway in the last round. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can do $1,050,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get as close as possible to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a dedicated support package, which will add significant value to the product. If you're still interested, I can meet you at $1,025,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Price is getting close:** While still above your ideal price, $1,025,000 is a reasonable compromise. 
* **Added value:** The 5-year warranty and support package add value that could offset future costs and hassle. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Alice is clearly signaling she won't go much lower. Continuing to negotiate risks her accepting another offer or reaching a stalemate, forcing you to buy from John at a much higher price."
