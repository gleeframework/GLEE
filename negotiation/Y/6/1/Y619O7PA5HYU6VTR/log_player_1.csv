Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,500,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high.  
* **Gauging Bob's eagerness:**  A high price will help you understand how badly Bob wants the product. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit.
* **Room for negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, there's room to negotiate down to a price that's still significantly higher than your guaranteed $1,000,000. 
* **""Exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time""**: These phrases create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially influencing Bob to act quickly."
