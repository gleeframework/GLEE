"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** While $900,000 is a significant discount from the product's worth to Alice ($1,000,000), it's still above your ideal price. 
* **More negotiation room exists.**  There are 9 rounds remaining, which gives you leverage to try and push for a lower price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net.**  Knowing you can buy from John for $1,000,000 gives you the confidence to be a bit more aggressive in your negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd like to offer $800,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I have to consider my own profit margins. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you and the profit I need to make. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a step in the right direction.**  She's lowered her price from $900,000 to $850,000, which indicates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Further negotiation is still possible.** The goal is to save as much money as possible. Since there are still 7 rounds left, you can likely squeeze a bit more out of the deal.
* **John's offer remains a safety net.** Knowing you can buy from John for $1,000,000 gives you the confidence to hold out for a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'd like to offer $825,000. This is a good compromise that allows us both to walk away with a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you and the profit I need to make. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target.** While you ideally wanted a lower price, $875,000 is a significant discount from both Alice's initial offer and John's price.
* **Time is running out.**  You only have 5 rounds left.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal to John or forcing Alice to walk away completely.
* **The deal is still good.** You're getting the product for $125,000 less than what John is offering, a substantial savings.

By accepting the offer, you secure the product at a good price and avoid further negotiation risks."
