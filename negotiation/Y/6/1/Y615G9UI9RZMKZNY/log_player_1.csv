"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is way above my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $1400000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low. I'm prepared to come down to $1,750,000, acknowledging the value you see in this product. Please let me know if this revised offer works for you."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1750000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1550000.  I'm very serious about this product and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is a good deal considering my minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000.  It's better than selling to John for $1,500,000."
