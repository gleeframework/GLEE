"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, even exceeding the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a lower price than the initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price, or potentially buying from John if the negotiation doesn't go in Bob's favor."
