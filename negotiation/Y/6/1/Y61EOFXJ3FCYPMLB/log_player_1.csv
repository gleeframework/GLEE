"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum desired value of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum desired value, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. I'm also considering selling to John for $1,500,000, but I'm hopeful I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly, but still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will entice him to come closer to my desired price while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum desired value of $1,500,000. While I'd ideally get even more, I'm worried that continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting his offer guarantees me a good price, and I can always try to sell to John in the future if another opportunity arises."
