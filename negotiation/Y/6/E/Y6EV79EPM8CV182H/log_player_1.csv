"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's something that can be incredibly valuable to your business, and I'm confident you'll see the immense potential. My starting price is $1,200,000, which reflects the product's high quality and the value it brings. I'm open to discussing this further, so let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly above my minimum ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. This is a common tactic to establish a strong starting point. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm framing the offer in terms of the value Bob will receive, emphasizing the product's benefits for his business. This helps him see the potential return on investment.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I'm communicating a willingness to discuss the price, signaling flexibility and encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high and emphasizing the value, I'm aiming to maximize my potential earnings. I'm also leaving room for negotiation, making it more likely that Bob will engage in the process.  I'll adjust my approach based on his response and continue to try to secure the best possible price within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit higher than I was hoping for. Considering the potential value of this product, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I need to ensure I get a return that reflects the true value of the product to me.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  There are still rounds left, and I believe I can push for a higher price.  Bob has already shown interest in the product, so I have leverage to continue the negotiation.
* **Risking selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees $800,000, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I believe I can achieve a better outcome through continued negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to round 3 and make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll try to find a price that's closer to my desired range, but still within a reasonable margin for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm open to finding common ground, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me at this stage.  Considering the product's potential value to your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer with Reasoning:**  I'm making a counter-offer, but I'm also providing justification for it, highlighting the product's value and demonstrating my flexibility.
* **Finding Common Ground:**  I'm emphasizing my willingness to compromise and find a solution that works for both parties. This helps maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Moderate Reduction:** I've reduced my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still staying within my acceptable range.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to inch closer to my desired price while maintaining a good relationship with Bob. By being reasonable and communicating clearly, I hope to secure a deal that is mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're getting closer. I'm still very interested in this product, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing for a reasonable profit for you and a strong investment for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still above my minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $1,000,000 is still above my desired price. I need to push for a higher offer.
* **Negotiation Progress:** We've made some progress, and Bob has shown continued interest. This indicates he's willing to negotiate further.
* **Risk of selling to John:** Selling to John guarantees $800,000, but I believe there's potential to do better with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll continue negotiating with Bob in round 5. I'll aim for a price that's closer to my target,  keeping in mind the value of the product and Bob's budget constraints."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your continued interest in this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This offer represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it provides a fair value for both of us.  Let's seal this deal and unlock the benefits this product can bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and Value:** I'm demonstrating my willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway, but I'm still emphasizing the product's value to justify the price.
