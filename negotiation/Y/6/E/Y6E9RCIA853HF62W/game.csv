"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1100000 is slightly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, while still allowing us both to make a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value your interest, $950000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which is still a significant investment for you but allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's aim for a fair deal that benefits us both.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is my absolute maximum. This price allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's aim to finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
