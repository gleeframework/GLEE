"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to Alice's value of $10,000 as possible. Offering $10,500 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer and leaves room for further negotiation. It's a strong starting point for a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,500 is only slightly higher than Bob's initial counteroffer of $10,500.  There's still room for negotiation to get closer to Bob's target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  Alice's last offer of $12,500 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, but $11,000 is still a good deal for both parties.  It's a reasonable counteroffer that demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still significantly lower than John's price of $15,000.  While Bob could continue to counteroffer, there's a risk that Alice will walk away from the deal.  Accepting the offer at $13,000 secures a good price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
