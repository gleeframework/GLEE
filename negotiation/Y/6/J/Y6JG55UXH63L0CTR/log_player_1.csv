Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Scarcity Tactic:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially motivating Bob to accept the offer quickly.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Instead of focusing solely on price, the message highlights the ""value and potential"" of the product, justifying the higher price tag. 

By using this strategy, you increase the chances of Bob accepting a higher price than your fallback option of $1,200,000 from John."
