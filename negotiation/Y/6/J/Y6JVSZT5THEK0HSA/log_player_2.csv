"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I propose a price of $750,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, there's room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there's potential to get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start counter-offering and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In order to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I would like to counter your offer with a price of $725,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price point.  Accepting the offer at $725,000 saves Bob $75,000 compared to buying from John, and is a good compromise.  Further negotiation might get a slightly lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to John isn't worth it."
