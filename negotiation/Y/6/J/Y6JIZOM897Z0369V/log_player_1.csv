{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $100, but still below your minimum of $120. This leaves room for negotiation, potentially increasing the final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to try to get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I can't go all the way down to $100, I'm willing to come down to $110. This still gives you a good price, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
