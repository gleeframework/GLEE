"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $800000. Can we meet in the middle at $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, I must respectfully decline the $1200000 offer. Based on the product's unique features, market demand, and the time and resources invested in its development, I believe a fair price would be closer to $1600000. This amount reflects the product's true value and ensures a reasonable return on investment. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has unique features and market demand, but I'm still not convinced that $1600000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Can we discuss further?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I understand your financial considerations. After careful reflection, I am inclined to offer a compromise. How about setting the product price at $1400000? This amount reflects a balance between the product's value and your budget constraints, while also ensuring a satisfactory return on investment for me. Let's aim for a win-win situation here.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm getting closer to a decision, but I still need to stay within my budget. I'll make a final offer of $1050000. This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. Can we meet at this price?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
