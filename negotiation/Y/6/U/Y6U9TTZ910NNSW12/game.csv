,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $87.50. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to compromise further. Considering the value of the product and your budget, how about $89? This seems like a fair price for both of us.",89.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I've given this some thought and I'm willing to go down to $88 for the product. This is the lowest I can go while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin for myself.",88.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go lower, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $88. I'm willing to meet you at $84.50. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",84.5,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your understanding, Alice, but I'm afraid I've already gone as low as I can. I'm still willing to walk away if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $84.50. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options.",84.5,Bob,10,
