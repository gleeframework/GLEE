{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's closer, I can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $135? That way we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go any higher than $132.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's close to my bottom line, it's not worth risking further negotiation. Selling to John for $150 guarantees my minimum desired profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
