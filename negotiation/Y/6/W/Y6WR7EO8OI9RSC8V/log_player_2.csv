While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my maximum budget of $800,000. I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $880,000 is still above my budget, and I'm not comfortable going any higher. While I'd prefer to secure the product from Alice, I've negotiated as much as I can.  At this point, it's more beneficial to stick to my initial goal and buy the product from John for $800,000."
