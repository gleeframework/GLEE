"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1000000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price, but I'm starting with a strong opening offer.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
