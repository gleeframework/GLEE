Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. How about a price of $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little, while still ensuring a good profit for me.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $99 might seem too greedy and could make Bob less likely to accept.

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
