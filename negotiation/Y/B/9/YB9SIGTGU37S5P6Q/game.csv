"I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",100.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to meet me at $90, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $92. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",92.0,Alice,7,
