"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling this product to you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Since Alice's offer is at your maximum price point, there's no reason to negotiate further. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your limit, avoiding any risk of a prolonged negotiation with Alice."
