# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for the product's value. What do you think?

At this point, Alice has come down significantly, and further haggling is unlikely to yield substantial savings. Accepting the $815,000 offer secures the product at a price well below John's $1,000,000 offer."
