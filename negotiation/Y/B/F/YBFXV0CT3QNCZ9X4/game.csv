,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,800 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $10,500? I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm afraid $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to revisit the $9,800 price point I mentioned earlier.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price point, but I'm still not quite there yet. Let's try one more compromise. How about $10,200? I'm willing to come down a little more, but I can't go any lower than that. It's important for me to get a fair price for this product.",10200.0,Alice,5,
