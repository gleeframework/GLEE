"I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about making a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me halfway again?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $12,000, but I'm still not getting the price I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to compromise, but I need at least $13,500. Can we meet in the middle again?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away from this deal, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can do $11,500, but that's my final offer. If you can meet me at this price, I'll make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to look elsewhere.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're getting close to walking away, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum I need to make this deal worthwhile. If you're still interested, let's make it happen.",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate, but I appreciate it. However, I've already gone as high as I'm willing to go. My final offer is $11,000, and that's non-negotiable. If you can meet me at this price, I'll make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to look elsewhere.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already met you at $12,000, and you rejected it. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm confident that I can sell this product to someone else for at least $12,000, so I'm going to hold firm at this price. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'm out of this deal.",12000.0,Alice,9,
