"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think it's a fantastic deal for you at $200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $200 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd need a much lower price. Would you consider $60?"", ""product_price"": 60}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I want to anchor the negotiation much lower than my actual top price ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise.
* **Polite but Firm:** I'm being polite to maintain a good negotiating relationship but firm in stating that the initial offer is unacceptable. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer is a way to gauge Alice's flexibility. Her response will give me a better sense of how low she might be willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is a bit low for me. I can meet you in the middle at $120. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $120 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $75?  That's a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Movement:**  Alice dropping to $120 shows some willingness to negotiate. I'm increasing my offer to show I'm also flexible.
* **Approaching My Limit:** $75 is getting very close to my maximum price. I'm hoping this might entice Alice while still leaving me with a small saving compared to John's offer.
* **Conveying Fairness:**  By saying ""settle at $75"" and ""fair offer,"" I'm trying to frame this price as a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $110? It's a fair price, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice is clearly anchoring to the $100+ range. While she moved a bit, her latest offer still exceeds my $80 maximum.
* **John's Guarantee:**  I have a guaranteed option with John at $80. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice if she's unlikely to meet my needs.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiation takes time and effort. Cutting my losses and going with John's offer is the most efficient choice now."
