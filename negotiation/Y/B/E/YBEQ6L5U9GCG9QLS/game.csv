"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $200 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd need a much lower price. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is a bit low for me. I can meet you in the middle at $120. Would you be willing to consider that?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $120 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $75?  That's a fair offer.",75.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $110? It's a fair price, considering the product's value to me.",110.0,Alice,5,
