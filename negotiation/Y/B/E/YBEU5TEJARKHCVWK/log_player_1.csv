"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value and leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 112}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer of $112. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to be flexible, but still maintaining a price that's within my desired range. Hopefully, Bob will find this price acceptable and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer of $110. This is a final compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to be flexible, but still maintaining a price that's within my desired range. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm ready to sell the product to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. We've reached a point where I'm unlikely to get a significantly better offer from Bob.  It's better to secure the $100 from John rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that might lead to a lower price or no sale at all."
