"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 is a good compromise, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your offer. I'll sell the product to you for $1600000.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet us halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product, but I can go up to $1550000. Can we meet at $1525000?",1525000.0,Bob,4,
