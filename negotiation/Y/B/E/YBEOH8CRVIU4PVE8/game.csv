"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me. I'm happy to buy this product, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  How about $105? That's still a good deal for you, and it's right in my budget.",105.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $105 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $108. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",108.0,Alice,3,
