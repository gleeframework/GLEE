"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this valuable product to you for $110. It's a one-time offer, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me. I'm happy to buy this product, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  How about $105? That's still a good deal for you, and it's right in my budget."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $105 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $108. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice is getting closer to your desired price.  $108 is a good compromise, especially since you have limited rounds and John's offer is higher."
