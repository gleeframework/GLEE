"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $850,000. This price is still beneficial for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000.
