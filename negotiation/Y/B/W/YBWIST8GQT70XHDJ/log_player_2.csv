"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is better than John's price of $1,200,000. However, there's room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $850,000. This price is still beneficial for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account your concerns while still recognizing the product's value.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $875,000 is still a good deal for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $1,200,000.
* While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject his counteroffer and he'll end up having to buy from John at a much higher price.
* Accepting Alice's offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the product entirely."
