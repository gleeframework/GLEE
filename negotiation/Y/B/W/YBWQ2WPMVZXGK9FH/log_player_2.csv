"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her value of $800,000, but it's still above your target of $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of this product, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is within my budget and a good compromise.  While I could potentially negotiate further, accepting this offer saves time and ensures I get the product.  It's a much better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000."
