"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $75?",75.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that 90 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for 82.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",82.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $82.50 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm happy to go with $80, which is my absolute limit.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,4,
