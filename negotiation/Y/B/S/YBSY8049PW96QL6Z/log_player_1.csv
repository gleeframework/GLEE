"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get close to my target value. I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, as $175 is significantly higher than the product's value to him. This gives us room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is above my minimum, it's still far below what I'd like to get.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum acceptable price of $150. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $120, but it's a compromise that might entice him to accept. It's also worth noting that if Bob rejects this offer, I can always sell the product to John for this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price, and I've already gone through three rounds of negotiation.  At this point, it's more beneficial to sell to John and guarantee my minimum value."
