"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150} 
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but not too high to scare Bob off right away. I'm also adding a friendly message to build rapport and show confidence in the product.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125?  That's still a great deal for a product like this."", ""product_price"": 125} 
``` 
 
I'm offering $125, which is my minimum price but still gives Bob some room for negotiation. I'm keeping the message friendly and emphasizing the value of the product.  Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $125. I'm still trying to stay within my budget, though. Would you be willing to go down to $110? It's a fair compromise, and we could both be happy with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to try one more time to negotiate with Bob and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $110 is still below what I can accept for this product. How about $115? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm trying to close the deal with a final offer that is close to my minimum while still being slightly negotiable. I'm emphasizing the compromise aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness. Let's see if this works!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to go up to $112, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum price, and I'm running out of rounds. I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than getting stuck with a lower offer and potentially losing out on the deal altogether."
