Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $18,000. I believe it provides significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This strategy is based on the following:

* **Anchoring:** Starting with a higher price ($18,000) sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even though it's higher than his perceived value, it gives you room to negotiate down. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** There's a chance Bob might accept the $18,000, especially if he's eager to secure the product or perceives additional value not factored into his initial $12,000 assessment.
* **Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, ensuring you meet your minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. The optimal strategy depends on factors like your risk tolerance, assessment of Bob's negotiating style, and how much you want to maximize your profit."
