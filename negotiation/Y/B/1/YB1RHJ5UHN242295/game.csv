"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price is still fair for both of us, considering the potential you'll gain from this investment.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be completely transparent, I've found a similar product for $800,000.  If you're willing to match that price, I'd be happy to close the deal with you today.",800000.0,Bob,4,
