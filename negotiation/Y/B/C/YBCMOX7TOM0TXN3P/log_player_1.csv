Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love.  I'm asking $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($80) but still below Bob's perceived value ($150). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly tone helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Asking for Opinion:**  Instead of just stating a price, I'm asking for Bob's opinion. This makes him feel involved and more likely to respond positively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $120 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to do $100? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm confident that Bob is genuinely interested in the product and will likely counter again.
* **Strategic Delay:**  By rejecting the offer, I can learn more about Bob's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110.  This gives us both a good deal, and I know you'll love the product!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by meeting Bob halfway.  This shows good faith and increases the likelihood of reaching a deal.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits for Bob, highlighting that this price will get him a product he values highly.
* **Firm but Flexible:** $110 is still above my minimum price, but it leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
