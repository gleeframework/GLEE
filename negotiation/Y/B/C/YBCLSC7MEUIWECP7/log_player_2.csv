# Alice's message: I'm offering you an exclusive deal on this product, worth $150 to you. I'm willing to let you have it for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer of $120 is less than your $150 maximum and a good deal compared to John's $150 price."
