"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, and I can get at least $10,000 from John. Therefore, it's better to keep negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,500 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price. There are still 6 rounds left, and I believe I can get a higher offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $11,500 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $12,500. This is a fair price, given the value you place on the product. Let's reach a deal!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is just below my target of $12,500.  However, with only 4 rounds left, it's getting risky to keep rejecting.  I'm confident I can't get a significantly higher offer from Bob, and John's offer of $10,000 is still a good fallback option.  Therefore, it's time to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
