It's time to cut your losses.  Alice has indicated that her absolute minimum is $12,000. You've been firm with your counteroffers, and it's unlikely she'll budge. While buying from John at $15,000 isn't ideal, it's better than potentially overpaying at the last minute if Alice refuses to negotiate further."
