Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but my initial offer reflects the true value of this product. I've already received interest from other buyers at a higher price point. However, I value your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. Let's meet halfway â€“ how about $1,300,000?
