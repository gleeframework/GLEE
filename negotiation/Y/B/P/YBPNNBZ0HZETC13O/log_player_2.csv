"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth exploring if you can get a better price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your target price. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get closer to your budget.  You're still $75,000 above your desired price, and you have 7 rounds left to potentially close a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,075,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,025,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and it's a significant step closer to your asking price.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,075,000 was too low, so I'll go back to my previous offer, but I'll add a small concession. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,080,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has made some concessions, her offer is still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further. You have 5 rounds left and you're already close to your target price. By continuing to counteroffer, you have a chance to potentially close the deal at your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,080,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,040,000, which is a good compromise for both of us.  We're getting closer, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1040000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,060,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has again reduced her price, it is still $60,000 above your budget.  You have only three rounds left, and given Alice's resistance, it's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a lower price.  It's better to secure the product for your desired price from John than risk losing the deal altogether."
