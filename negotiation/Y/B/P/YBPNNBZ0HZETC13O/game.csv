"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's worth considering.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,075,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,025,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and it's a significant step closer to your asking price.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,075,000 was too low, so I'll go back to my previous offer, but I'll add a small concession. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,080,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,080,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,040,000, which is a good compromise for both of us.  We're getting closer, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1040000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,060,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",1060000.0,Alice,7,
