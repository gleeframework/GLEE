"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,150,000 to make this worthwhile.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
