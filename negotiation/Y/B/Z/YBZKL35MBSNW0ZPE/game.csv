"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $900000 is lower than my initial asking price, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to accept $1000000 for the product. This price still reflects the value it offers, but it's a step closer to your proposal. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $950000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,
