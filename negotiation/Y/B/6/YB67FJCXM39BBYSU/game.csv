"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $8000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer, but I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.  How about $12500?  This would still leave you a good margin for profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original offer, but $12500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $9500? I think that's a fair price for the product and I'm willing to make a decision if you can agree to that price",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $11000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be very valuable. Let's make this happen.",11000.0,Alice,5,
