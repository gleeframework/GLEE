Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $8000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer, but I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.  How about $12500?  This would still leave you a good margin for profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.
