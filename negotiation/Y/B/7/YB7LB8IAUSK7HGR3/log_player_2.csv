Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $7,000. How about $8,200?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,000. I think we're getting close, though. How about we meet in the middle between $7,500 and $8,000? I'm willing to sell the product to you for $7,800. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is very close to her own valuation and unlikely to go much lower. Accepting the offer at $7,800 secures a reasonable deal for Bob."
