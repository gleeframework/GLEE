I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed sale price of $800,000 with John.  

Here's my reasoning:

* **Maximize potential profit:** A $200,000 profit is much better than the $800,000 guaranteed with John.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** This high offer will immediately test how much Bob values the product. 
* **Negotiation room:** If Bob rejects, I can always lower the price slightly and try again, or default to John."
