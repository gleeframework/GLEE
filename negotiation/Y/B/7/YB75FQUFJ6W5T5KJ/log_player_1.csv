Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Let's keep this negotiation going."", ""product_price"": 14000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
