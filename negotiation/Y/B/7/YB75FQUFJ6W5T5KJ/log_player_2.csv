Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However, $10,500 is still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm asking $14,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let's keep this negotiation going. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $13,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  If we can agree on this price, I'm happy to seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, but $13,000 is still a little high. How about we settle at $12,500? That's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still slightly below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise a little further and come down to $12,800. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly reducing her price, and it's unlikely she'll reach a price significantly lower than $12,800 within the remaining rounds. Buying from John guarantees a price of $10,000, saving us at least $2,800 compared to Alice's current offer.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Alice when we have a guaranteed better deal elsewhere."
