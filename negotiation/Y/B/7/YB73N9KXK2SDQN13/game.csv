"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,400,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,500,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1,550,000? It's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,550,000 is not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,400,000 and $1,500,000. How about $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Bob,4,
