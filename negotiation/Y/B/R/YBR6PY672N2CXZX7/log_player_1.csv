Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high with Bob, knowing you have John as a safety net.  However, being too greedy could make Bob walk away.

**Possible Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll see."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,400,000 is a strong starting point. It gives you room to negotiate down if needed while still securing a significant profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" reinforces the product's worth in Bob's mind.
* **Focus on ROI:**  Mentioning ""return on investment"" speaks directly to Bob's potential gains, making the price more palatable.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (around $1,350,000) to give yourself more wiggle room.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a less aggressive starting point might be preferable.

**Remember:**  Negotiation is a dynamic process. Be prepared to adjust your approach based on Bob's responses and counter-offers."
