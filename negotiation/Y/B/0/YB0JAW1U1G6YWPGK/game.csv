"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $850000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe it's a bit steep at $850000, and I'd like to make a more reasonable offer.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $600000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $750000. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $700000, but I think I can do better than that. Can you consider $680000?",680000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $725000. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but I'm still not sure $725000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $700000, but I think I can do better than that. Can you consider $690000?",690000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're still trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I can offer it to you for $715000. It's the final price I'm willing to consider. If you're not willing to meet me at this point, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",715000.0,Alice,7,
