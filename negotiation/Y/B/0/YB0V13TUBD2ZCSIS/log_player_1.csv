"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,750,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also highlights the value I place on the product and sets a strong initial position.  If Bob rejects this offer, we can start the negotiation process and hopefully reach a price we're both happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, I believe I can secure a better price. I will counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is still above Bob's initial offer but shows a willingness to compromise. It's also closer to my minimum acceptable price. I hope this counteroffer encourages Bob to meet me halfway."

Round 4

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Although time is running out, I'm determined to get closer to my target price. I will counteroffer again in the hopes of reaching an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,550,000. This is a significant concession but still aligns with my minimum acceptable price.  It's a strong signal to Bob that I'm serious about reaching a deal.  Hopefully, he recognizes the value of the product and is willing to meet me halfway."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and we are running out of time.  I've made significant concessions, but Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway. To avoid further negotiation and secure a price closer to my desired value, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
