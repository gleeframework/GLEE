"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get. Could you do $12,500? It's a fair compromise.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,4,
