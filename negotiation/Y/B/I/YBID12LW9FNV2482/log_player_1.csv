Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,750,000. This is a strong opening offer that leaves room for negotiation. While it's likely Bob will counter, I'm hoping to get him closer to my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on Bob's response, but I'm confident I can reach a deal that's favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd prefer to close a deal with him, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic loss. I'll counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value to me. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing offer for Bob, while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer, his offer is still far too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000. I'll counter with a price that's closer to his offer but still reflects the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction from my last offer, and shows I'm serious about reaching an agreement. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing offer to Bob, while still allowing me to achieve a decent profit. If he rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum desired price, but it's still not enough. I'm not comfortable going any lower.  Given John's offer of $1,500,000, it's clear I can get a significantly better deal by selling to him.  I'm choosing to sell the product to John to maximize my profit."
