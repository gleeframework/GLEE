"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase our product. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However,  $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $750,000. Let me know if that works for you.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $750,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,250,000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit low for me, but I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, which is my absolute minimum for this product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable, but I have to be honest, I'm getting close to my absolute limit. I could stretch to $975,000.  Let me know if that works for you, otherwise I may need to explore other options.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
