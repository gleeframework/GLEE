"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $11,000, knowing Bob values the product at $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is closer to my minimum of $10,000, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500.  This is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,000. This is my absolute minimum, and I'm hoping that Bob will finally agree to it. We've been going back and forth for a few rounds now, and I don't want to risk selling to John for the same amount."
