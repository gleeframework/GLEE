"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be happy to buy it for $95. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'll accept $105. Let's make this happen!",105.0,Alice,3,
