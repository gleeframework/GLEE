"I understand your offer, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $125? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're still trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm getting close to my minimum price. How about we try $119? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",119.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass on this offer. I'm willing to walk away and buy the product from John for $150. It's not the best deal, but it's better than giving in at $119. I'm out of counteroffers, and I think I've negotiated as hard as I can.",0.0,Bob,8,
