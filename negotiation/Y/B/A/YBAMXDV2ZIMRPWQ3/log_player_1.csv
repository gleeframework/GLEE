Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice knows John will buy the product for $1,200,000, so there's no reason to go below that. Offering a price slightly lower than her guaranteed sale price creates room for negotiation while still aiming high.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, and Alice wants at least $1,200,000.  A price of $1,150,000 splits the difference and might be tempting enough for Bob while still netting Alice a significant profit.
* **Exclusivity Encourages:**  By phrasing the offer as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" Alice adds a subtle psychological element that might make Bob more inclined to accept."
