"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit more, how about $125? That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $115 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120? It's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Alice,5,
