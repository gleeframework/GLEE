"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find valuable. Given its unique features, I'm initially pricing it at $20,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and what you know the product is worth to John. It makes sense to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering.  While I agree your product is valuable, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $8,000 to start the negotiation."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my $10,000 maximum. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that Alice's initial price is unrealistic.
* **Respectful Tone:**  I want to keep the negotiation amicable, so I'm acknowledging the product's value while firmly stating my position.
* **Testing the Waters:** This low offer will gauge Alice's flexibility.  If she's completely unwilling to budge, I can always walk away and go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $8,000 is significantly below its true worth. Could you consider something closer to $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down a bit, but she's still way above your budget and even further from your starting offer. This suggests she might be willing to negotiate, but you'll need to hold firm and see if she's willing to move closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase, But Strategic:** I increased my offer substantially to show Alice I'm serious about negotiating. However, I'm keeping it below my $10,000 maximum, leaving some room for a final compromise. 
* **Targeting a ""Fair"" Price:**  $11,000 is slightly above my ideal price but well below Alice's initial ask.  This aims for a price that feels like a win for both of us.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By not going to my absolute maximum, I'm signaling that Alice needs to move closer to my range for a deal to be reached."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,000 is closer to a fair price, I'm still seeking a higher amount. Would you be willing to consider $15,000? This would be my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, meaning further negotiation is unlikely.
* **Above Budget:**  Even though Alice has come down significantly, $15,000 is still above your maximum budget of $10,000.
* **Guaranteed Alternative:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John at $10,000.

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice. You've tried to reach a compromise, but her final offer doesn't meet your needs. Buying from John ensures you get the product at a price you find acceptable."
