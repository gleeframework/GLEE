"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we consider $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I recognize its value, $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  How about we settle at $1,000,000? That's a fair offer, considering I can buy it from John at that price. ",1000000.0,Bob,4,
