Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product is of incredible value, and I'm offering it to you first before I go to other buyers.  I think you'll find it's worth significantly more than my asking price. How does $950,000 sound?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, there's potential to get even more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** $950,000 is a strong opening, aiming to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value close to my own. 
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning other buyers implies Bob might miss out if he doesn't act.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the price is firm, the wording suggests a possible discussion. Bob might counter-offer, and I can always slightly adjust down (e.g., to $925,000) while still making a significant profit."
