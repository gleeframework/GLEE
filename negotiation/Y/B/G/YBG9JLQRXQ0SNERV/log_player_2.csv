"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product, which is worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this product at a reasonable cost. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is lower than the price you would pay John ($1,000,000).  While it's not the absolute lowest price, it's still a good deal for you and saves you $100,000."
