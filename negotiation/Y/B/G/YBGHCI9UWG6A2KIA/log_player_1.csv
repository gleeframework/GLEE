This offer leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a decent profit. It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I can't accept such a significant drop in price. I'll counteroffer and try to reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,200,000? This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to make sure I'm getting a price closer to what the product is worth to me.  I'll counteroffer again and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $1,050,000 is still below what I can accept.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit.  Let me know if you're open to this."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,150,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. Even though we've been negotiating, we're not getting close to a price I'm comfortable with.  I've already lost a lot of time with this negotiation, and it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer, which is much more profitable for me."
