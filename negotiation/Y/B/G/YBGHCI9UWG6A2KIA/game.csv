"I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Can you meet me at this price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,200,000? This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $1,050,000 is still below what I can accept.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit.  Let me know if you're open to this.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,150,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",1080000.0,Bob,6,
