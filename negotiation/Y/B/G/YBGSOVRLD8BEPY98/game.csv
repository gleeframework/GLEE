"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $160 to start. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $60 is quite low for this product. It's high quality and I'm sure you'd find it valuable. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. $110 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $70?  That's a reasonable price for both of us, I believe.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations of the product.  I'm willing to come down to $95 just to move things along. This is my final offer.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't go higher than $75. It's a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can make this deal work.",75.0,Bob,6,
