"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I've done some research and I believe that's a fair price for this product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my original asking price.  How about $1,350,000? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $1,300,000? I think that's a fair price for the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
