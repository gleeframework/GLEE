"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to invest strategically, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $775000.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $775000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still aiming for a price point that allows for a more substantial return. I'd like to propose a final offer of $750000.  This seems like a fair price for both of us, and allows me to move forward with the purchase. Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,4,
