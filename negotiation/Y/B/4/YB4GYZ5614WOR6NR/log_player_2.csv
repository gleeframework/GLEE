Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential for you.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in finding the right fit, and something tells me this product could be a game-changer for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000, but that's my absolute best.  It's a significant investment, but the returns will be worth it.
