"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $750000. Considering the product's unique features and my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $925000. This is the best price I can offer, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $812500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",812500.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand that you're not willing to sell the product for any price below $900000, but I'm not willing to pay that price. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't come to an agreement. I'm willing to meet you at $850000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.
