Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I believe it could be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** A friendly and enthusiastic message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Focus on value:** I'm hinting at the potential benefits of the product for Bob, without revealing specific details that might give away my own valuation. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message makes it clear that I'm open to discussion and willing to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer.  It's also important to consider that if Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer for $8,000."
