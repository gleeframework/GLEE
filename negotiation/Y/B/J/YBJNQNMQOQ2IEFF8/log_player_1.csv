Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product. I believe it would be very valuable to you. What do you think about a price of $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 allows for some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Avoid a ""Take it or Leave it"" Approach:**  The message is phrased in a way that invites Bob's input, making him feel more involved in the process.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still maintaining a high chance of a successful sale."
