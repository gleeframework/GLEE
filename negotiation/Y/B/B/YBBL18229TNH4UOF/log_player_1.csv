{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, given its value to you, and it's a very fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's high enough to give Bob room to negotiate, but it's also below the product's worth to him, making it a potentially attractive deal.  It also allows for a bit of negotiation space if Bob counters.  I'm confident I can get a good price for my product, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if I don't get an offer close to what I want."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum desired price of $800,000.  I'm not willing to sell for less than that. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price we're both happy with.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price than Bob's initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but not at that price. How about $1,000,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $950,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's a significant reduction from your original price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, and I'm confident I can't get a much better price in the next round. While I'd prefer to get more, this deal is still profitable for me and it's important to remember that Bob is a potentially valuable client. Accepting this offer allows for a smooth transaction and sets the stage for future potential sales."
