"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal. Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,500,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price, potentially saving money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation. By starting with a lower price, Bob sets the tone for a more competitive negotiation and tries to maximize his savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000. It's still a good price for you, and it's closer to my bottom line.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is within Bob's budget and a good price considering the product's value to him. While further negotiation is possible, accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of a longer negotiation that might lead to buying from John at a higher price."
