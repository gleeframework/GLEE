It's too expensive.  Alice's offer is way over your budget. It's time to counteroffer and see if you can negotiate a better price."

Let's start with a lower offer. $1,000,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still within the range of what you're willing to pay."

I'm going to offer $1,150,000. It's a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  Hopefully, this will be more appealing to her."
