"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and still get a good price.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if I don't reach a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic price reduction. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a price that is fair to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $10,000 is significantly below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I'm confident this price still gives you a great value, and allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $14,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, Bob's offer is still too low. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $13,000.  I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $13,000 for this product.  I really believe this is a fair price for both of us, and would be happy to close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise. I'm getting close to my limit, but I could make it work at $12,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum price, so I'll accept it.  While I would have preferred a higher price, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds and want to close the deal. I'm happy with a $12,000 sale, especially since I could still sell to John for $15,000 if the deal falls apart."
