"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $22,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $22,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $10,000 is quite a ways off from what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and bring you great value.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I'm interested, $18,000 is still too high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,000.  Let's work together to find a price that makes sense for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank,  $12,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, but that's my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're close to your bottom line, but $16,000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. If you're open to that, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",14000.0,Bob,6,
