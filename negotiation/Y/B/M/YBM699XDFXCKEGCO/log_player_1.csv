Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot, so I'm starting with a price of $150. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This initial offer is high but leaves room for negotiation. I'm starting at $150 because I know the product is worth at least $100 to me, and I want to maximize my profits.  I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation by saying ""Let me know what you think!""  This shows good faith and encourages Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I think $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. It's possible he's willing to pay more, especially if I make a counteroffer.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as there's still potential to get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $120.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I still value the product. I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer to encourage Bob to accept and avoid further back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $110 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $110 is a decent price, and it's better than selling to John for $100.  There's a good chance that if I reject this offer, Bob will either walk away or offer a price closer to his initial $100."
