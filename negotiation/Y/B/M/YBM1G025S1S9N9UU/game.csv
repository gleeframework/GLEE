"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair offer considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $760,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,,
