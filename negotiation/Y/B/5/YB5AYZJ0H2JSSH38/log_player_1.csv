**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $1,250,000. While we could push for more, it's getting riskier.  Here's why accepting is the best move now:

* **Profitable:**  $1,250,000 is a $50,000 profit over our guaranteed sale to John.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations and secures the funds.
* **Risk Mitigation:** There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and we risk losing him entirely by pushing further. 

Taking the sure $1,250,000 now outweighs the potential (and increasingly less likely) chance of getting more from Bob."
