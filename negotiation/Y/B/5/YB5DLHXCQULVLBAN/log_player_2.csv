Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try and negotiate a better price.  $950,000 is still above your budget, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best move in this round."

Round 2

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and you're only in round 3. There's still time to negotiate a better price. Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high and we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds.  It's becoming increasingly unlikely that we'll be able to get the price down to our desired level.  To avoid risking further rounds of negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether, it's best to secure the product from John at his guaranteed price of $800,000."
