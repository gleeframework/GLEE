"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $950,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $900,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Can you consider that?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $850,000 is a tempting offer, I believe this product holds more value. Would you be willing to meet me at $900,000? It's a win-win for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is the right price. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but I think I can do better than that. How about we meet at $825,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle at $887,500? It's a strong offer that reflects the true value of this product.",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $887,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I can do better than that. How about we try $837,500? I'm making a serious offer, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",837500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're having this discussion, but I need to be upfront.  My bottom line is $875,000. That's my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I understand, but I have another buyer ready to go at my minimum.  I believe this product is worth the investment, and I hope you see the value as well.",875000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have another buyer ready to go, but I'm still interested in this product. I'm willing to go up to $862,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. Can you think about it?",862500.0,Bob,8,
