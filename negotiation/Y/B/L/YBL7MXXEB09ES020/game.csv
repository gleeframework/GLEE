"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to keep my investment under $1,000,000. Let's start with $1,100,000. I believe this price is still fair, considering the value you place on the product.  I'm open to discussing it further.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm open to discussing it further if you're interested.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's meet in the middle at $1,200,000. This price would allow both of us to secure a good deal. I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me, considering the value I place on this product. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,250,000.  I'm confident this price represents a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
