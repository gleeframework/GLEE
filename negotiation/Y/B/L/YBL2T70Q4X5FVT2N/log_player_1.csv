Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so he's willing to pay up to that amount.
* **My Floor:** My minimum acceptable price is $10,000, as that's what I'd get from John.
* **Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 gives Bob a $1,000 discount while still netting me a $4,000 profit over my minimum. This is a good compromise that maximizes my earnings while giving Bob a reasonable price. 

Let's see if he accepts!"
