"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still a little out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8,750 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,200 is closer, but I'm still a little over budget.  I'm going to offer $9,000 one last time.  This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is your final offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I've already gone as low as I can, and I'm not willing to give it away. I'm willing to sell it to John for $8,000, and I think it's a great deal for him. If you're not willing to meet me at $9,200, I'm going to have to consider selling it to him.",9200.0,Alice,7,
