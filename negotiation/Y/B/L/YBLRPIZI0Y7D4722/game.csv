"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While the product looks great, $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? I think that's a fair price.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, I must respectfully decline the offer of $100. Our product is highly valued and comes with exceptional quality and features. I would like to propose a price of $125, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value it offers. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",125.0,Alice,3,
