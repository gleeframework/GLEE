I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value but allows room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is my minimum value, I believe I can do better. Bob's initial counteroffer was low, indicating he's likely willing to pay more.  I'll make a counteroffer to see if I can reach a more profitable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm countering with $12,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's low counteroffer. I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it might be appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting increasingly low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop below my minimum value.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, it makes sense to sell to him and avoid further negotiations."
