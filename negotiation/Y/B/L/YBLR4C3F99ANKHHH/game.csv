"Alice,  $900000 is a good starting point, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $750000.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's unique features and its value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $800000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",800000.0,Bob,4,
