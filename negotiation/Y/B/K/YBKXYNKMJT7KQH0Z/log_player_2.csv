"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her minimum value ($800,000) but still significantly below your maximum value ($1,200,000).  You can likely negotiate a better price, so rejecting and counter-offering is the best strategy to save money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. Considering your persistence, I'm willing to reduce the price to $915,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above her minimum value of $800,000.  Although she has come down slightly, there is still room for negotiation.  You can likely get a lower price if you continue to counteroffer.  It's better to continue negotiating and see if you can reach a price closer to your target."
