Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and persuasive tone, highlighting the value of the deal for both of us. 

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest while still ensuring I don't sell the product below my minimum value. If Bob rejects, I can further adjust the price based on his counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Selling to John at this point would be a much more profitable option.  However, I want to see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer, but I need something closer to $900,000 to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $900,000. This is a compromise, as it's lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget, but also emphasizing the need for a price closer to my desired range. I'm framing this as a collaborative effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. 

This counteroffer shows flexibility while still maintaining a significant profit margin.  If Bob rejects this, I might consider selling to John, but I'm hoping to secure a deal with Bob if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired range. I've already made concessions and Bob has stated this is his final offer.  At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob, as he's shown reluctance to meet my price expectations."
