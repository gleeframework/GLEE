Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need at least $120 to be happy (I can sell to John for that price).
* **Bob's value:** Bob only values the product at $80.
* **Finding a compromise:**  $100 is a price that's above Bob's value, but still below my minimum, giving me a chance to make a sale and Bob a potential deal.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings by finding a compromise that might be acceptable to Bob."
