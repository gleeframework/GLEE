"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a better price than $150 from John, you can likely get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  You know the product is worth $120 to Alice, so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $130, which is a fair price considering the product is worth $120 to Alice. This gives her a profit and is still a good deal for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is a good deal for me, as it's lower than what I'd pay John ($150) and still leaves Alice with a decent profit. There's a good chance that further negotiation will lead to a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to John isn't worth it."
