"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $900000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a significant amount, but I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm offering you a price of $875000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $875000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. I'd like to make one more offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at $850000.",850000.0,Bob,4,
