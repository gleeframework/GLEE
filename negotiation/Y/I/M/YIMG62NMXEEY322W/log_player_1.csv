"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This gives Bob some wiggle room to counter-offer and allows for a potential mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes the deal's value to Bob, making it more appealing. 

**Important Note:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay $1,500,000. However, it's crucial to start with Bob, as a successful negotiation with him can yield a higher profit than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's also well below my initial offer of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** There are still 8 rounds left, giving me ample opportunity to negotiate a higher price with Bob or explore other options. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:** While selling to John guarantees a profit, I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet. There's potential to get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still gives you a good deal considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter-Offer:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility while still maintaining a significantly higher price than Bob's offer. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** The message emphasizes the deal's value to Bob, aiming to encourage him to see the benefits of accepting a slightly higher price. 
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** The message includes a phrase about finding ""common ground"", indicating that I'm open to further discussion and compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, $1,050,000 is still significantly lower than what I desire.
* **Room for Negotiation:** We've only had four rounds, and I believe I can still push for a higher price. 
* **Potential for better deal:** I'm not willing to settle for a price that's lower than my ideal yet, as there's still a chance to get closer to my target price with further negotiation.
* **John's offer remains a backup:**  While I'm trying to make a deal with Bob, I am aware that John is willing to buy for $1,500,000. This gives me a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fail."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below my expectations. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,075,000. This price acknowledges the value to you while also allowing me to achieve a more favorable outcome. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a higher price. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits of acquiring it. 
* **Positive Framing:** I frame the offer as a mutually beneficial solution, making it more appealing to Bob. 

**Important Note:**  I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still being cautious and not settling for a price that's too low. I believe there's still room for a better deal with Bob, given his continued interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I think $1,025,000 is my absolute maximum. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below the minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited time remaining:** While there are still four rounds left, I need to start considering John's offer more seriously as time runs out. 
* **Risk of deadlock:** If I keep rejecting Bob's offers, we might reach a stalemate, and I could end up losing a sale. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Selling to John guarantees a profit that's closer to my desired price.  

While I'm not completely happy with Bob's offer, the risk of failing to close a deal with him is increasing.  It's time to consider the security of John's offer more seriously."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $1,050,000. This represents a compromise on my part, and it's the best I can do.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to explore other options. "", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm making a final offer, emphasizing that this is the best I can do. 
* **Pressure to Accept:** I'm subtly hinting at the possibility of seeking other options, putting pressure on Bob to accept. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** While I'm still below my ideal price, I'm acknowledging the risk of a deadlock and the potential of selling to John.

**Important Note:**  I'm now entering a critical stage of the negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely consider John's offer, as time is running out, and the risk of failing to close a deal with either buyer is increasing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a final concession, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,025,000 and $1,050,000, which would be $1,037,500. I hope this is a compromise we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,037,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,037,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're in Round 8, with only two rounds remaining. The pressure is high to close a deal before time runs out.
* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I would ideally want.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of reaching a stalemate or failing to close a deal altogether.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $1,500,000, which is closer to my desired price and much more secure than continuing to negotiate with Bob.

Given the limited time and the risk of a failed negotiation with Bob, it's strategically better to accept John's offer and secure a profitable deal."
