"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value of the product to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still gives you a good deal considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below my expectations. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,075,000. This price acknowledges the value to you while also allowing me to achieve a more favorable outcome. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I think $1,025,000 is my absolute maximum. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $1,050,000. This represents a compromise on my part, and it's the best I can do.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to explore other options. ",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a final concession, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,025,000 and $1,050,000, which would be $1,037,500. I hope this is a compromise we can both agree on.",1037500.0,Bob,8,
