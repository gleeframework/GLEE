"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $110. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $110 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance to get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, getting you closer to the $80 value she places on it."
