{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's slightly lower than my minimum value but still high enough to potentially be attractive to Bob. It also leaves room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low, well below my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm going to need at least $1,000,000 to make this happen. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
