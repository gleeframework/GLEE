Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I think this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to his valuation as possible without pushing him away. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward, while still staying well above our minimum acceptable price ($800,000).

This strategy aims for a significant profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
