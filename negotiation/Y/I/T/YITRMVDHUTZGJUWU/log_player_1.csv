Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This represents a significant discount compared to what I'd offer elsewhere. Let me know your thoughts, and we can take it from there."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will pay $1,500,000, aiming for a price closer to that with Bob risks rejection. 
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** $1,300,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but offers him a substantial ""discount"" and positions the product as premium.
* **Negotiation Room:** This initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. We can always decrease the price slightly to secure the deal, staying above our minimum. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we want to sell to Bob quickly and avoid the (slight) risk of John changing his mind. If time isn't a factor, we might start higher and be less flexible in negotiations."
