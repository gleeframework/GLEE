"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be very valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $13,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It's also closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring I don't give away too much value in the initial offer.  I'll be ready to counter if Bob rejects, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and well below my minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to close the deal, I need to hold out for a better offer.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'll keep John's offer in mind, but I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is too low. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and it reflects my desire to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12000}
