Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify spending around $6,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. $6,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This price still reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and meet at $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not comfortable with $7,250. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can get closer to a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $7,250 is still too far from what I need.  How about $8,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's the lowest I can go. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
