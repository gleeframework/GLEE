"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify spending around $6,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This price still reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's meet halfway.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and meet at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $7,250 is still too far from what I need.  How about $8,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's the lowest I can go. Let's close this deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
