Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I anticipate, I'm offering it to you at a price of $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down a little.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  Offering the product at $10,000 aims to find a middle ground where you, Alice, earn significantly more than Bob values the product, while still giving Bob an incentive to buy it from you instead of seeking alternatives.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a secured buyer (John) at $12,000, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a price that might be attractive enough for him to accept."
