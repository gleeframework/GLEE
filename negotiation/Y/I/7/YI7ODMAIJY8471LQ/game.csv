"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  That's still a great deal for you, and it leaves me with a reasonable profit.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,750?  It's a fair price for both of us.",13750.0,Bob,4,
