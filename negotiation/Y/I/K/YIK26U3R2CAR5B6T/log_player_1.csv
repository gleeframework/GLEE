I'm going to start high and see if Bob is willing to pay my minimum.  If he isn't, I'll have to consider John's offer, but I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob if I can."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$900,000 is too low for me.  I'm going to try and get a better price from Bob, but if he won't budge, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to meet Bob halfway.  $1,100,000 is still a good price for me, and it's a reasonable compromise from my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal. If not, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to lower my price again to $1,050,000.  This is a significant compromise for me, but I'm hoping Bob is finally willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```

I've gone as low as I'm willing to go, and Bob still isn't budging.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  While I'm not getting my ideal price, $1,200,000 is still a good deal and I don't want to risk losing out on it by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
