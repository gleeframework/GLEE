"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm only able to go up to $12000 at this time.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value ($15,000).**  
* **I have 10 rounds, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.** 
* **Selling to John would be a safe option, but I want to maximize my profit.**

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to drop my price to $13,500. This is a good compromise, and I'm sure you'll find it to be a great value for your money."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still sticking to my maximum of $12000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it avoids having to involve a third party. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value ($15,000).**
* **While it would be quick and easy to sell to John now, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.**  I've shown I'm willing to negotiate, and it's possible he might be persuaded to go a little higher.
* **I still have 6 rounds remaining, giving me ample opportunity to reach a more profitable agreement.**

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is slightly higher than his offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
