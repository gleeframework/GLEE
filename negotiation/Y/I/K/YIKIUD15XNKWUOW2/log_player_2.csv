"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than Alice's initial valuation of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm only able to go up to $12,000 at this time.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to drop my price to $13500. This is a good compromise, and I'm sure you'll find it to be a great value for your money. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, allowing Bob to potentially get a better deal or ultimately buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still sticking to my maximum of $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it avoids having to involve a third party."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to drop my price to $13000.  This is a good compromise, and I'm sure you'll find it to be a great value for your money. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's price is still above Bob's budget.  While more rounds of negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, there's no guarantee.  Buying from John at $12,000 is a sure thing and meets Bob's price limit."
