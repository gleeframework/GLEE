# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to us, but I understand its value to you might be around $100. I propose we start the negotiation at $150 for the product. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to suggest a different price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
