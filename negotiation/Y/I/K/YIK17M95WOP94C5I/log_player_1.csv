{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $1,200,000 is still a significant profit for Bob.
* **It's above your minimum:** You're still making a profit well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust the price based on Bob's response, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation.

This strategy balances your need to maximize profit with the potential for a successful deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. This is a significant discount from my maximum budget of $1500000, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum price, it's still significantly lower than what you initially proposed. You have room to negotiate further, potentially securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is still quite low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** It demonstrates your willingness to compromise.
* **Still leaves room for negotiation:** It's higher than Bob's offer but still below your initial proposal, allowing for potential adjustments in the next round.
* **Focuses on mutual benefit:**  The message emphasizes a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $975000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $975,000 is a significant profit for you and a decent deal for Bob.  While you could try to squeeze out another few thousand dollars, it's likely this is the best offer you'll get.  There's always the risk of Bob walking away or you ending up selling to John for a lower price. Accepting this offer secures a solid profit and avoids unnecessary risk."
