"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than the product's value to Alice ($1,200,000), it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth negotiating further with Alice to see if a better price can be reached.  

There's also the option of buying from John for $800,000, but it's wise to exhaust negotiations with Alice first to see if a better deal is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $950,000, but it's still within Bob's budget and leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is still too high for Bob.  It's actually higher than her first offer, which indicates she might not be willing to budge much.  Bob should continue to try to negotiate a lower price.  While buying from John for $800,000 is tempting, there's still room for negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. This shows that he's willing to negotiate but still holding firm to his budget.  $875,000 is a compromise, halfway between Bob's previous offer of $850,000 and Alice's current offer of $975,000. This might encourage Alice to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $990,000 is still too high for Bob, and it's getting increasingly clear that she's not willing to drop her price significantly. With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice is high.  It's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000, ensuring he gets the product within his budget."
