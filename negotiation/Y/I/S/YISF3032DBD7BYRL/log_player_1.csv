Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,450,000 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **It shows you're serious:**  By offering a price close to his potential value, you demonstrate that you're willing to negotiate seriously.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still lower than my desired price point. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm reducing my initial offer slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum. This shows I'm flexible but still aiming for a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm still hoping for a higher price, Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum acceptable price.  However,  I'm worried that further negotiation will drag on, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. John is offering a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is a safe and secure option. I'm going to sell the product to John."
