{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. I'm not at liberty to disclose details about the product just yet, but I can assure you it's worth at least $1,000,000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,250,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire something truly special.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss it further."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message is designed to pique Bob's interest without revealing too much information. It highlights the potential value of the product and positions it as an exclusive opportunity. 
* **Product Price:**  The price is set at $1,250,000, leaving a substantial profit margin for Alice while still potentially being attractive to Bob. 

**Rationale:**

* **Uncertainty:**  Alice doesn't know Bob's valuation, so she needs to balance maximizing profit with the risk of rejection.
* **Potential Value:** The message emphasizes the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to create a sense of urgency and desirability.
* **Profit Margin:**  A $250,000 profit margin is significant, ensuring Alice doesn't sell the product for less than its minimum value to her. 

This approach aims to balance risk and reward, presenting a compelling offer to Bob while securing a substantial profit for Alice."
