"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000.  This gives Bob a little room to negotiate while still leaving me with a profit.  I'm confident in the value of the product and believe that a good negotiator like Bob will recognize its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't accept a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is still a good price for Bob, considering he values the product at $1,200,000. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable compromise and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum price. It's not ideal to sell at my minimum, but continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the sale."
