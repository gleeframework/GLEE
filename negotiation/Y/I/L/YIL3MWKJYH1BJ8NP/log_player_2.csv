"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really like it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John.  Alice's starting offer is a bit high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
 ""product_price"": 85
}
```

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Polite and Positive:**  Keeps the negotiation friendly.
* **Expresses Interest:**  Shows Alice we are serious about buying.
* **Substantial but Not Insulting:** Jumps down below Alice's desired profit, but leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think $110 is a bit steep, but I have to make a profit. I can do $105 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate.  We'll send another counter-offer to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think."",
 ""product_price"": 95
}
```

Here's the strategy:

* **Acknowledgement:** We acknowledge Alice's willingness to move on price.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** This framing makes the offer seem more reasonable and encourages agreement. 
* **Target Price:** $95 is a good price point â€“ a significant saving for us, but still profitable for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. It's a great product and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to hold onto some profit, and $100 is a reasonable compromise. It's a good deal compared to John's $120 price, and further haggling might not yield much more."
