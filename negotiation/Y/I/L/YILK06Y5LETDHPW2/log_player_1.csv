Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a price that's higher than my minimum acceptable value of $80, giving me a profit. If Bob rejects, I can still sell the product to John for $80 and avoid a loss. This strategy balances my desire for a higher profit with the risk of Bob refusing the offer."
