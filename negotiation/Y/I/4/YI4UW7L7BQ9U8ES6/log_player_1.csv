Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $149. It's a fantastic deal!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John, it's always best to try for a higher price first. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $149 is just below your guaranteed price and might be enticing enough for Bob to perceive it as a ""deal"" even though it's significantly more than he values the product for.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this offer doesn't explicitly invite negotiation, it leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested, potentially allowing you to reach an even higher price."
