"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's likely Alice is willing to go lower. Rejecting the offer allows you to explore if you can get an even better deal. You have a safety net with John's offer, so there's no risk in trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price. It's aggressive, but it shows that you're serious about negotiating and are willing to walk away if you don't get a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is a reasonable price considering John's offer of $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer saves you $400,000 compared to John's price. While further negotiation could potentially get a lower price, the risk of Alice walking away or not budging further isn't worth the potential savings."
