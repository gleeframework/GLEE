"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in continuing this negotiation.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While I value your interest,  $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,350,000. This would be a mutually beneficial agreement, allowing us both to achieve our goals.  What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
