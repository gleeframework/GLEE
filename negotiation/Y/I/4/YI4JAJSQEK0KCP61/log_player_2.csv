"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be thrilled with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $90 is still close to your limit, and there are 9 more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate it.  However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit steep, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $82.50 is closer to my limit, there's still room for negotiation.  I'll keep trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $82.50 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $80.  Let's see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $81.50. It's a small increase from your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $81.50, which is a good compromise and within my budget.  It's getting closer to my limit, and continuing to negotiate risks me not getting the product at all. I'm willing to accept this offer."
