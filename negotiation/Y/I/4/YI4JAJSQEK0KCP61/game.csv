"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be thrilled with your purchase.",90.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate it.  However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit steep, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $82.50 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $80.  Let's see if we can strike a deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $81.50. It's a small increase from your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",81.5,Alice,5,
