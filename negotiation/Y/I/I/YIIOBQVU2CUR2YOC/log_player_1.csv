Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not sure if $13,000 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $11,500. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.

While Bob's latest offer is closer to a fair price, his counteroffers are moving too slowly. It's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price before the potential profit dwindles to the point that John's offer is more appealing.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
