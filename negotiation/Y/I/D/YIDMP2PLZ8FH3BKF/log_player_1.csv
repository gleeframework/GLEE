"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $10,000. This is a strong opening offer, and I'm hoping he'll counter. If he doesn't, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$9,500 is far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to take such a big loss.  I'll counteroffer and try to find a price point closer to my $12,000 minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but I'm still holding firm to a value that's closer to my minimum. This counteroffer shows flexibility, while still maintaining a profitable price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While the negotiation is getting tough, I'm holding out for a better deal.  I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's valuation of the product. This counteroffer is a significant concession from my previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  With only 4 rounds left, the pressure is increasing. I'm going to counteroffer again, but this time I'll need to think carefully about how much I can afford to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm now at my minimum acceptable price, and I'm willing to accept this deal. If Bob rejects, I'll sell to John to avoid losing more time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are out of time. Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price. I'm not willing to take a loss, so I will sell to John for $12,000.  It's a shame I couldn't get more, but at least I'm walking away with a good deal."
