"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'd be getting it for less than its value to you, and I'd still make a profit. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is less than her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  You should always aim for the best possible price."
