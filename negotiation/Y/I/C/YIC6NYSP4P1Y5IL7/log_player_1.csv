I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, as the product is worth $100 to Bob, and I want to maximize my profit."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

I'm offering a price of $110. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $90.  It's still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, and I hope Bob will accept."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, we're running out of time. It's not worth risking a deal falling apart. John is a guaranteed sale, and I'm happy with the price."
