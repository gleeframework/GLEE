"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the benefit to Bob in my message, making it sound like a good opportunity rather than just a sales pitch. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm expressing a willingness to negotiate, which can make Bob feel more comfortable engaging in the process.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I'll need to assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy for subsequent rounds, potentially even choosing to sell to John if it's not working out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I won't accept such a low offer.
* **Opportunity to Counter:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to find a price that works for both of us. There are still 8 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:**  Selling to John right now would guarantee me $15,000. However, I believe I can potentially get closer to that price through negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll try to gauge his willingness to pay more by suggesting a price somewhere between $12,000 and $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $12,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by suggesting a price that's significantly higher than his $10,000 offer but lower than my initial $14,000 proposal. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the benefit of the price to Bob, emphasizing it's still a good deal for him.
* **Reinforcing Minimum:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have a minimum price point I'm not willing to go below, but I'm open to negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll either adjust my offer again or consider selling to John if it seems like a better option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $11,250 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's closer than Bob's previous offer, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to find a price that works for both of us. There are still 6 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate further.
* **Maintaining Value:**  Selling to John right now would guarantee me $15,000. However, I believe I can potentially get closer to that price through negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll try to gauge his willingness to pay more by suggesting a price slightly higher than $11,250, but still well below my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $11,250 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product. "", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my last offer of $12,500 and Bob's offer of $11,250. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price for both of us and highlighting the value of the product to Bob.
* **Building Momentum:** I'm trying to build momentum towards a deal by showing flexibility and a genuine desire to reach an agreement.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully assess Bob's response to this offer and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects this offer, I may consider increasing my offer slightly or even considering selling to John if it seems like Bob is unwilling to meet me halfway."
