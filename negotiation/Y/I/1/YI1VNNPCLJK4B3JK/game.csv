"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's get started with a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm interested, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's try $1,025,000. This is a compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,000,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
