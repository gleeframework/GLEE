Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm interested, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Bob's offer:
