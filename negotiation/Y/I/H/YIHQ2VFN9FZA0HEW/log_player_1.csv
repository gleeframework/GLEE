Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer sets the price at $1,500,000. Here's the reasoning:

* **It's higher than your guaranteed floor:** This ensures you make more than your minimum if Bob accepts.
* **It's not too high:** While it's a significant markup, it's still plausible that Bob might find value in the product beyond what you know. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob balks at the price, you can potentially negotiate down a bit without sacrificing your minimum value. 

By starting high, you maximize your potential gains while still having room to maneuver if needed."
