"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and I believe it's also valuable to me at this price point. Let's make a deal. Would you like to purchase the product for $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can save at least $5 by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  It's worth exploring if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I'm looking to spend closer to $75. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet halfway? I propose to sell the product for $80. Is that within your range? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than Alice's initial offer, you're still only saving $20. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get a price closer to your target of $75."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $80 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $77.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 77.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. Considering our previous discussions, how about we settle on $79? It's a slight compromise that reflects the value we both see in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $79 is a good deal. You're saving $21 compared to buying from John.  While you might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars by continuing to negotiate, the risk of Alice walking away or you running out of rounds isn't worth it.  Accepting this offer is the best way to secure the product at a good price."
