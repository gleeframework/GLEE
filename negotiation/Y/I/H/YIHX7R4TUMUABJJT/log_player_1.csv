"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and features, I'm asking for $20,000. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired selling price. This provides room for negotiation and might lead Bob to counter with a price closer to your target. 
* **Confident Presentation:**  The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing your bottom line.  This helps create a perceived higher value.

By starting high, Alice leaves space to potentially meet Bob somewhere in the middle while still staying well above her minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a decent offer, Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000.  There's still room for negotiation. She's better off rejecting and countering, aiming to settle somewhere between $14,000 and her $15,000 minimum.  Selling to John at $15,000 is her backup plan if negotiations don't improve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I'm eager to find a deal, $14,000 is below what I can accept.  Would you consider $17,000?  That's a significant price drop from my initial offer and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 17000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice makes a substantial concession from $20,000 to $17,000, signaling flexibility but maintaining a price above her minimum.
* **Anchoring:** By countering with a price still notably higher than Bob's offer, Alice keeps a higher number in play for potential compromise.
* **Justification:** She frames the concession as significant and highlights her willingness to make a deal. 

This approach aims to bring Bob closer to her range while keeping the option of further negotiation or accepting John's offer open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $17,000. How about $15,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $15,500 is now above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  There's no guarantee she can negotiate a better deal with Bob, and waiting risks him lowering his offer or walking away. It's in Alice's best interest to secure a profitable deal now."
