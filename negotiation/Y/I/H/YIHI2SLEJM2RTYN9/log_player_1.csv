Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $1,200,000 (what I would get from John).
* **Bob's maximum willingness to pay:** $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation space:** $300,000.
* **Strategic pricing:** Offering $1,400,000 leaves a significant amount of profit for Bob ($100,000) while still ensuring a substantial profit for me ($200,000). This makes the offer appealing to Bob and leaves room for potential negotiation if necessary."
