"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,300,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see that you're getting close to your target, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I can offer you a price of $1,250,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, let's shake on it!",1250000.0,Alice,5,
