"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe the product is valuable, but I'm not willing to go above $800,000. Can we meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is still below what I believe this product is worth.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make this deal work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so how about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the best I can do.  If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to come down, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider this offer?",925000.0,Bob,6,
