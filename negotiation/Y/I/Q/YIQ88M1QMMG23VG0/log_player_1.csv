"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, I'm hoping to get a better price.  Given your value for the product, I'd be willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While $9,500 is better than selling to John, I still have room to negotiate and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit more. How about $10,500?  This still gives you a good deal, considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This gives us both a good deal and allows us to finalize the transaction.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $10,000.  While I'd love to get even more, this is a good compromise that gives me a decent profit while ensuring the sale.  It's better than selling to John for $8,000, and it's likely I won't get a better offer from Bob."
