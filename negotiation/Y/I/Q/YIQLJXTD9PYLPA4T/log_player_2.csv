"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you.  My asking price is $1,400,000,  which is a significant discount from what it's worth to you. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another buyer lined up at $1,000,000.  Let me know your decision at your earliest convenience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message tries to create urgency and imply a higher value, you know your maximum price is $1,500,000. Alice's offer of $1,400,000 saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
