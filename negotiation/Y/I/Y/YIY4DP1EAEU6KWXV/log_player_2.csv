"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I'm personally valuing at no less than $12000, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price.  How does $10000 sound? This is a significant discount, and it gives you the opportunity to acquire something valuable at a very attractive price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
