Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for sale. I believe it's worth at least $200. How does $180 sound to you?"", 
""product_price"": 180
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high but reasonable:** Offering the product at $180 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above your minimum price. 
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  This initial offer will help you understand how eager Bob is to purchase and how much he values the product. 
* **Leave John as a backup:**  You always have the option to sell to John for your minimum price, so there's no need to rush into a deal with Bob if it's not beneficial for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $140 is below your minimum acceptable price of $150.  While you want to make a sale, you're better off seeing if you can negotiate a better price or selling to John. There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $140 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $160? That's a fair price for such a valuable product."",
""product_price"": 160
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility but stand firm:**  By coming down in price, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate. However, you are still holding firm above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** Reminding Bob of the product's value reinforces why your price is justified.
* **Meeting in the middle:** This classic negotiation tactic can feel like a win-win for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $145? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to get as close to $150 as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm near his budget limit, and while he's willing to compromise slightly, it's unlikely he'll meet your minimum price of $150. You have a guaranteed offer from John at your desired price, so it's more profitable to sell to him at this point. Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing both potential sales."
