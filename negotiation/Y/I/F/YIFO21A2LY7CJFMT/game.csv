"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $90? That's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'm willing to pay $85, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $87.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",87.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $87.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $82.50. That's my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll accept it.",82.5,Bob,6,
