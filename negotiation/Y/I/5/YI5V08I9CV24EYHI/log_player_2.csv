"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a little steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

This counter-offer attempts to:

* **Be polite and keep the negotiation positive.** We want to encourage Alice to continue the conversation. 
* **Establish a lower starting point.**  By offering $70, we're aiming for a price closer to Alice's value ($80) while staying under our $100 limit.
* **Leave room for negotiation.**  We're open to increasing our offer if needed, but we've started at a point that potentially benefits us more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $70 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're getting closer, but we can still try to negotiate a bit lower.  Alice is willing to move from her initial offer, so there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we make it $75?  That's a fair price for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Continuing the negotiation:** We're still aiming to get a better price than $85.
* **Meeting in the middle:** We're signaling that we're willing to compromise by moving up from $70.
* **Psychological aspect:** Offering $75 instead of $76 or $78 seems like a more firm and ""final"" offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $82.50? It's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Alice is moving in smaller increments now.  It's unlikely we'll get a significantly better deal.
* **Good Price:**  $82.50 is a solid discount from both Alice's initial offer and John's backup price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate risks annoying Alice or pushing her to walk away. Accepting now secures a good deal."
