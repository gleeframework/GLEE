Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and I'm confident it would be valuable to you.  I'm asking for $10,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and his perceived value of the product. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob."
