"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't afford $11,000 at this time. Would you consider lowering the price to $9,500? I appreciate your understanding.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go as low as $9,500. Let's meet in the middle. How about $10,250? It's still a good deal for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,3,
