Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the potential value, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This offer represents a fair price that acknowledges the product's benefits while working within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
