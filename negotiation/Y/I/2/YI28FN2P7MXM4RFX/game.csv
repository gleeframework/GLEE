"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits it can bring. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $850,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $875,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,5,
