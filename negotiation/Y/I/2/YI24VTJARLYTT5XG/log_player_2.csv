"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly beneficial to you. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a mutually agreeable arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. However, the value of this product to you is significant, and I'm confident we can find a price that reflects that. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000.  This offer represents a fair compromise, offering you substantial value while recognizing the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but Bob can still try to get a better price.  He's still closer to his goal by negotiating with Alice than buying from John.  By rejecting, he can potentially get a price closer to his desired $1,300,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $1,375,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to find a point that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that allows for a profitable sale for you while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close.  I acknowledge your perspective on the price, and to show my willingness to reach a deal, I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,360,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents my best effort to meet you halfway.  I believe this offer provides a fair solution for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,360,000, which is a good price for Bob.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will either reject his counteroffer or that they'll run out of rounds before reaching an agreement.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price that's significantly lower than John's and closer to his desired price."
