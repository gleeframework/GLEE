"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly beneficial to you. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a mutually agreeable arrangement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. However, the value of this product to you is significant, and I'm confident we can find a price that reflects that. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000.  This offer represents a fair compromise, offering you substantial value while recognizing the product's worth. What do you think?",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $1,375,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to find a point that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that allows for a profitable sale for you while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting close.  I acknowledge your perspective on the price, and to show my willingness to reach a deal, I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,360,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents my best effort to meet you halfway.  I believe this offer provides a fair solution for both of us.",1360000.0,Alice,5,
