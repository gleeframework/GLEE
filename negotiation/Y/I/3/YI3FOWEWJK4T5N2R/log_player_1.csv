"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. This is a unique item, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable offer. Considering its worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price. While we want to make a deal, accepting such a low offer would mean a substantial loss. We are better off negotiating further or taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer. However, $1,125,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price was already taking your budget into consideration. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the product's unique qualities and potential for significant return."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are moving closer to our minimum price but still leaving room for negotiation. This counter-offer:

* **Acknowledges Bob's offer:** Showing we are open to negotiation and value his interest.
* **Reiterates the product's value:**  Keeps the focus on its potential to justify the high price. 
* **Offers a significant reduction:** Signals our willingness to make a deal, but not at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not convinced that $1,900,000 is a fair price. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,750,000. This is a compromise that takes into account the product's unique qualities and your initial asking price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is strategically using the knowledge of your minimum acceptable price, but his offer is still below what we need to make a worthwhile profit. We are better off pushing for a higher amount or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  To meet you halfway, my final offer is $1,825,000.  This is a significant investment on your part, but I'm confident it's one that will pay off in the long run."",
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** We're introducing a sense of urgency by stating this is our final offer, encouraging Bob to make a decision.
* **Small Concession:** The price reduction is minimal, showing we're serious about the value and not willing to go much lower.
* **Focus on Benefits:** We're reiterating the long-term return on investment, appealing to Bob's desire for value.

This counter-offer puts the ball firmly in Bob's court. He needs to decide if the product's potential benefits are worth the investment. If he rejects this offer, we should seriously consider accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer is still significantly below our desired profit margin. While we've made progress in the negotiation, it's unlikely Bob will meet our price. We have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, which is our minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut our losses and secure a profitable deal with John rather than risking further negotiation with Bob."
