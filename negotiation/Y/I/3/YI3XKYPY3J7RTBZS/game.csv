"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, we're willing to make a counteroffer. We believe the product is worth more than $1,000,000, but we're willing to meet you halfway. We're offering the product to you for $1,300,000. We think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price point that allows for a good return on investment. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and  allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement on this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your continued interest in our product. After careful consideration, we're willing to make another counteroffer. We're willing to meet you at $1,150,000, which is a significant discount from our original price. We believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business and the value we're willing to walk away from if we don't reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
