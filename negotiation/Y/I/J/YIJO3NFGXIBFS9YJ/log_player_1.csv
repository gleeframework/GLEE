I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects my offer, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $10,000 is too low, and I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation to see if we can reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is a compromise that is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but closer to Bob's offer. I hope this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000.  Bob's counteroffer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with him at this point, as John is offering me a guaranteed price that meets my minimum."
