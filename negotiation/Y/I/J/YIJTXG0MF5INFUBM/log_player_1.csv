Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth $100 to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm coming down a bit, but I still want to get as close to my minimum as possible. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
