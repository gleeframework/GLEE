"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but based on my research and budget, I am only able to consider a price of $1400000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $1400000 doesn't quite meet my expectations for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1450000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's true value. Let's work towards an agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I still feel that $1450000 is out of my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1425000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable solution.",1425000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility in the negotiation.  However, $1425000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $1437500.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",1437500.0,Alice,5,
