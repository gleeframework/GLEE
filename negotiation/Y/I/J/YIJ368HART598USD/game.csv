"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1200000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'd like to offer $1100000. This reflects a fair price given the product's unique value and my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to consider another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than $1150000. This price takes into account the product's unique value and the benefits it can bring to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1175000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
