"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first.  $110 is a bit high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to move the negotiation closer to my desired price range. It's a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it leaves room for further negotiation while still being a fair deal for both sides."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $105? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving in the right direction, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll try one more time to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $97.50?"",
""product_price"": 97.50
}
```

This counter-offer aims to find a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's current price. It shows willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your thinking, Bob! Splitting the difference is a great idea. However, I'm not quite ready to go that low just yet. How about we try $102.50? It's still a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly very slowly negotiating towards my desired price. However, at this point, the difference between her offer ($102.50) and my ideal price (around $90) is getting smaller. Further haggling might not be worth the potential risk of losing the deal altogether.  It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm happy to secure the product at this price."
