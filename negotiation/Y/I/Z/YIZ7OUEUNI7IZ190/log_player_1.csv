{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a price significantly higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,000?  That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
