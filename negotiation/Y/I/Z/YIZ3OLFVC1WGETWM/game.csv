"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $800,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower my price to $900,000.  This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, but it also reflects the value you've placed on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I am still unable to meet you at $900,000. I would like to propose a price of $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can move forward with the transaction.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $850,000 still falls short of where I need to be. However, to show good faith, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've stated and the progress we've made. What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts in negotiating, Alice. However, I am still unable to meet you at $875,000. I would like to propose a final offer of $825,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can conclude this transaction.",825000.0,Bob,6,
