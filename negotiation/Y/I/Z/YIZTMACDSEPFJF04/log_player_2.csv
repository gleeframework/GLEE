"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a unique product that has a significant value. I believe it could be extremely valuable to you, but I understand its worth may be different for each individual. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000.  This is a fair price considering its potential and the fact that I have another interested buyer willing to pay $800000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
