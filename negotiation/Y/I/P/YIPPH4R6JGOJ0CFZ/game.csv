"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1800000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits it can bring to your business.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1800000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000 if possible.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1700000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's worth while also being reasonable for your budget.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1700000 is closer to what I'm comfortable with, I still believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. I propose a counteroffer of $1600000. This allows us to stay within your comfort zone while minimizing the cost for me.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1600000, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting a higher price. I'll make one more counteroffer: $1650000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my needs, Alice. I understand that $1650000 might be the best you can do, but I'm still looking for a more reasonable price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1600000 again. This is the highest I can go without compromising my budget significantly.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
