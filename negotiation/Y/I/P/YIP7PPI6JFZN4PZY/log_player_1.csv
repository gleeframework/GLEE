Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also reflects the value the product has for Bob. I'm hoping this offer will encourage him to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm still confident that I can get closer to the $1,200,000 mark. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a price we are both happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I believe the product is worth more than $1,100,000. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm concerned that we're too far apart and further negotiations might take too long. I'm happy with the $800,000 offer from John, and I'm going to take it."
