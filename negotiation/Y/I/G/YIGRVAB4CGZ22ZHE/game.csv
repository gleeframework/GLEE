"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1200000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1350000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to reach a mutually beneficial deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering $1300000. Is this a price you'd be willing to meet me at?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I was thinking we could meet right in the middle of our previous offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1295000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",1295000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable selling the product for $129000. That's a significant drop from our previous discussions. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer, and I'm thinking of $1290000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. Is this a price you'd be willing to meet me at?",1290000.0,Alice,9,
