"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $14000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $16500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. Let's make a deal!",16500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $16500 is still a bit above my budget. How about we try $14800? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from $15000, but I need to save as much as I can.",14800.0,Bob,4,
