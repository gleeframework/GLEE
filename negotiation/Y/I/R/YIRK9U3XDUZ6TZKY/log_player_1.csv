"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more than you realize. I'm willing to offer it to you at a starting price of $1,800,000. I think it's a fair starting point considering the potential benefits you'll reap."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** I'm starting with a deliberately high price ($1,800,000) to establish a strong anchor. This aims to shift Bob's perception of the product's value closer to my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, attempting to justify the high price by focusing on its potential benefits.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By stating it's a ""starting price,"" I signal my willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be useful, but not at that cost. I'm willing to offer $500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far too low. While I expected him to counter with a lower price, $500,000 is significantly below my minimum ($1,200,000) and even his own perceived value ($800,000).  It's important to show I'm not going to settle for a price that undervalues the product. Rejecting this offer sets the stage for more serious negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $500,000 is simply not a realistic valuation for this product and its potential. I'm prepared to meet you halfway between our offers. How about we consider $1,150,000?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Hold Firm:** I acknowledge Bob's counter-offer to show I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm holding relatively close to my $1,200,000 minimum, emphasizing that I'm serious about the product's value. 
* **Strategic Compromise:** By suggesting we ""meet halfway,"" I'm offering what appears like a significant concession (even though it's still above my minimum). This might encourage Bob to make a more substantial move towards my range.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  I'm only slightly above my minimum now, subtly implying that if this counteroffer doesn't work, I might take John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000, but that's as high as I can go right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, $650,000 is still significantly below my $1,200,000 minimum. Accepting would mean a significant loss. It's time to apply more pressure and signal that my alternative option is becoming increasingly attractive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving up on the price, but we're still significantly apart. To be honest, I have another offer on the table for $1,200,000.  I'd prefer to work with you, but I need you to be closer to that figure for this to make sense. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but this is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition and Urgency:** By revealing John's offer, I create a sense of urgency and competition. Bob now knows I have a strong alternative, making him more likely to take my offer seriously.
* **Final Offer:** Stating this is my final offer puts pressure on Bob to make a significant move if he wants the product. It also signals my willingness to walk away if necessary.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm still making a small concession to show flexibility, but it's clear I'm close to my limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be upfront with you. My budget for this product is capped, and to be honest, I've already secured an alternative option at a significantly lower price. I can offer you $750,000, but I need you to understand that this is my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to walk away. Here's why:

* **Bob's Revealed His Hand:** He's clearly stated his budget is capped and he has a cheaper alternative. This means it's highly unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer, even with further negotiation.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing with Bob risks losing John's guaranteed offer.  While there's a chance Bob might counter higher, it's not worth jeopardizing a sure $1,200,000.
* **Stronger Position:** By walking away, I demonstrate my product's value and my own negotiation strength. This could even lead to Bob reconsidering and coming back with a better offer (though I wouldn't bank on it).

In this scenario, accepting John's offer ensures I get the best possible outcome."
