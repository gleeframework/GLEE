"Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more than you realize. I'm willing to offer it to you at a starting price of $1,800,000. I think it's a fair starting point considering the potential benefits you'll reap.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be useful, but not at that cost. I'm willing to offer $500,000.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $500,000 is simply not a realistic valuation for this product and its potential. I'm prepared to meet you halfway between our offers. How about we consider $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000, but that's as high as I can go right now.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving up on the price, but we're still significantly apart. To be honest, I have another offer on the table for $1,200,000.  I'd prefer to work with you, but I need you to be closer to that figure for this to make sense. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but this is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be upfront with you. My budget for this product is capped, and to be honest, I've already secured an alternative option at a significantly lower price. I can offer you $750,000, but I need you to understand that this is my absolute limit.",750000.0,Bob,6,
