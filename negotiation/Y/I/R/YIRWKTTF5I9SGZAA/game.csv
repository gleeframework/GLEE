"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me there?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to your target as possible. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not comfortable going all the way down to $8,500. How about we meet at $8,750? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I'm putting into this negotiation.",8750.0,Alice,5,
