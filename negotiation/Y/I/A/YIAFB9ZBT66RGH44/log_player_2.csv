# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your needs perfectly.

This is a special opportunity for you to secure this high-quality item at a competitive price.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're offering. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $6,500 for the product. This price reflects my budget and the value I see in it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 6500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget considerations. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $7000 for the product. This price still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while offering you a competitive deal. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking to save as much money as possible. While $7,000 is a better price than the initial offer, Bob can likely negotiate a lower price by continuing the negotiations. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore the possibility of an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $7,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $6,800 for the product. This is my final offer, as it's close to my budget limit. Let me know if you're willing to accept this."", ""product_price"": 6800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience and understanding, Bob. Considering your latest offer, I am willing to accept $6900 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise between your budget and the value of the product. I hope this meets your expectations and we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $6,900 is close to Bob's final counteroffer of $6,800.  It's a good deal for Bob, allowing him to save $1,100 compared to buying from John. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob running out of rounds is high. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without taking unnecessary risks."
