"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I believe it's highly valuable to you, so I'm proposing a price of $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $130 is less than your maximum of $150.
* **You save money compared to buying from John:** Buying from Alice saves you $20.

Even though you could get the product from John for $150, it's always beneficial to save money when possible."
