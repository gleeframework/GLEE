I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it shows that I'm willing to be flexible while still getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, and I'm happy to accept it. It's better than selling to John, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal with further negotiation."
