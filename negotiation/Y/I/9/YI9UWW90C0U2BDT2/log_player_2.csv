"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  You can likely get a better price by negotiating.
* **There's no risk in rejecting.** You can always buy from John if negotiations with Alice fall through. 
* **You have 10 rounds.** This gives you ample time to negotiate and hopefully secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** Starting with a counteroffer of $900,000 shows Alice you're serious about getting a good price.  This is a significant discount from her initial offer.
* **Room for negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves room for you to compromise in future rounds. 
* **Avoid getting stuck:**  You're not willing to pay John's full price yet, so negotiating is important."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice moved closer:** Alice lowered her price from $950,000 to $925,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Good price, but not a steal:** While $925,000 is still a bit more than you initially wanted, it's a good deal compared to John's price.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  You risk Alice getting stubborn or having her price go back up if you keep rejecting. 
* **Time is ticking:**  You only have 7 rounds left, and continuing to negotiate could lead to you needing to buy from John."
