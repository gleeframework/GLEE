Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This price is higher than my minimum value of $120, but still leaves some room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $130 is still higher than my minimum value of $120, and it's likely that he won't budge much further. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit."
