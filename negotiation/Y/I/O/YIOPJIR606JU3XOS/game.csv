"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $8,500?  This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate the compromise.  However, $7,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",8000.0,Alice,5,
