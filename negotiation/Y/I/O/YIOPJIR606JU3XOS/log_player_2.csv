"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This offer is closer to my true valuation but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $8,500?  This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but the offer is still above John's price. Let's see if we can negotiate further and get closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 7250
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are suggesting a price that is exactly halfway between her last offer ($8,500) and our previous offer ($6,000). This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate the compromise.  However, $7,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has matched John's price. There is no further benefit to negotiating as we have reached our target price.  We should accept the offer to secure the product."
