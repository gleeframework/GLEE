"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm thinking $10000 would be a fair price, considering its value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product but $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $8000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8000 is just too low for me.  The product is truly unique and worth much more than that. How about we split the difference and go with $9000?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go any lower.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $9000 is closer, but I'm still a little stretched. How about we meet in the middle at $8500?  It's a fair price for both of us and gets this deal done.",8500.0,Bob,4,
