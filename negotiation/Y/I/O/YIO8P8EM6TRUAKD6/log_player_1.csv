Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Its value to you is undeniable, and I believe a price of $1,850,000 reflects its significance. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I want to maximize my potential profit.  Starting significantly higher gives room for negotiation and still ensures a good outcome.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's high value, potentially influencing Bob's perception of its worth. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer. This opens the door for a potentially even more profitable deal.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round offer. Ideally, in a real negotiation, there would be multiple rounds of offers and counter-offers."
