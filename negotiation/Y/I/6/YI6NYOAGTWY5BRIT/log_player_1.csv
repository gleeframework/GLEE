"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity for you to expand your business. I'm asking for $1,200,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the potential benefits to Bob, trying to make him see the product's worth beyond just the price. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** By starting high, I'm setting the stage for a negotiation. I expect Bob to counter-offer, giving me the chance to come down slightly. 
* **Setting a Deadline:**  I'll be keeping a close eye on the rounds to ensure I don't get stuck in a protracted negotiation.  If it doesn't seem like we're getting close to a deal, I'll switch to John to secure my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:**  Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm confident that I can get a better price. 
* **Exploring Further:** I want to see if I can get closer to my target value by continuing the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**  I'll counteroffer Bob with a price higher than his offer but lower than my original offer. This will show my willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize my profits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but demonstrating flexibility by offering a counter-proposal.  
* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer is a compromise, aiming to meet Bob halfway while still maintaining a profit margin for myself.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and my commitment to a fair deal, but also subtly implying that I may not be willing to negotiate much further. 
* **Next Steps:** I'll continue to analyze Bob's responses and adjust my strategy based on his willingness to negotiate. I'm prepared to walk away from the deal if necessary, as I have a backup option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,050,000 for the product. Can we seal the deal at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is Ongoing:**  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value. The negotiation is progressing, and I'm confident I can get a better price.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** I'll counteroffer again, showing my willingness to negotiate but not to concede too much.  

**Next Steps:** I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my target price.  If he rejects it, I'll need to carefully weigh my options - continue negotiating or switch to selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference. I'll accept $1,075,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll get.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum value.
* **Pressure is On:**  I'm going to continue to push for a higher price,  as I have John as a backup option. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his current offer, but I'll need to be careful not to give up too much ground. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to sell to John in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  I'll accept $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his last offer, but still above my minimum acceptable value.

* **Emphasizing Finality:**  I'm suggesting this is my best offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Next Steps:** I'm hoping this will be the final offer. If Bob rejects it, I'll be prepared to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. I'll offer $1,037,500 for the product. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with. Can we finalize the deal at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,037,500.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and Bob's offers are still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  There's a high chance that we will reach an impasse if I continue to negotiate. 
* **Securing My Minimum Value:**  John is a guaranteed buyer at my minimum value. It's better to secure this deal than to risk a prolonged negotiation with Bob that could lead to a lower price or a failed deal. 

**Next Steps:** I'll inform Bob that I've decided to sell to John, thanking him for his time and interest."
