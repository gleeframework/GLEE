Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000.  This leaves room for negotiation, but is still well above my minimum of $8,000. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I think I can still get more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves me with a decent profit."
