"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $15,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential benefits it offers.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business and the value it will add to your operations.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,500 is still outside my price range. I'm confident that $12,000 is a fair and reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me. I'm happy to close the deal at this price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
