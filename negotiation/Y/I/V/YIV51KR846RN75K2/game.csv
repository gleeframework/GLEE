"That's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $85 for it.",85.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $100?  That's a fair compromise.",100.0,Bob,4,
