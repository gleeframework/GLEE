"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counter-offer starts the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This strategy leaves room for us to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a price well below John's $100 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $70 is too low for me.  Would you consider $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but we can still try to negotiate a bit further before accepting or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $70 was a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $78?"",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

This counter-offer shows Alice we're willing to move up but also aims for a price that's advantageous for us. It's still below John's price while being closer to Alice's desired range."
