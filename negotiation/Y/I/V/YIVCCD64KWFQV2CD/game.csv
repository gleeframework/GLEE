"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $700,000? I believe this would still provide a good return on investment for me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget constraints, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still looking to stay within my financial limits. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $825,000? This would allow me to make the most out of my investment while staying within my budget.",825000.0,Bob,4,
