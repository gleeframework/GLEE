Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $950,000."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer that's slightly higher than what you're ultimately willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he can bring the price down. 
* **Close to Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. By starting at $950,000, we're aiming for a price close to his perceived value while still maximizing profit.
* **Significantly Above Alice's Minimum:** $950,000 is significantly higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000, ensuring a good profit margin.

This opening offer sets the stage for a potentially successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $700,000? I believe this would still provide a good return on investment for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). This suggests there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this low offer, you signal that you're serious about getting a fair price and encourage Bob to make a more reasonable counteroffer. You're still in a strong position since you have the backup option of selling to John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?"", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection of Lowball Offer:** By countering, we clearly indicate that $700,000 is unacceptable.
* **Justification:** We're not just dismissing his offer; we're explaining that it doesn't reflect the product's value, subtly reminding him of its worth to him.
* **Compromise (Meeting in the Middle):**  This classic negotiation tactic aims to appear reasonable and willing to find common ground. It's a significant move from our initial offer but still well above our minimum. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is:
    * Substantially higher than Bob's offer ($875,000 vs. $700,000)
    *  Lower than our initial offer ($875,000 vs. $950,000)
    *  Significantly higher than our safety net ($875,000 vs. $800,000 from John)

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while maintaining a strong position for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget constraints, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still looking to stay within my financial limits. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $825,000? This would allow me to make the most out of my investment while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While you could potentially push for a bit more, the difference is relatively small at this point. Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further protracted negotiations."
