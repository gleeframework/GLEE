"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is better than $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Alice values the product at $1,000,000, so a counteroffer closer to that value could potentially lead to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges the value Alice places on the product, while still giving Bob a healthy discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,150,000, which is still a good deal for Bob considering his maximum budget is $1,500,000.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially get a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away or Bob might end up buying from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer secures the product for a reasonable price, minimizing risk."
