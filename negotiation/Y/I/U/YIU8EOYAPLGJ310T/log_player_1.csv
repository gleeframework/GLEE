"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. This is a great deal considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's important to start with a price that leaves room for negotiation. $1,500,000 is a significant markup on my minimum value, but it gives me leverage.
* **Establishing Value:** My message emphasizes the product's value and potential to entice Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear I'm open to discussion, encouraging Bob to counteroffer if he's interested. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  If he rejects, his counteroffer will reveal his perceived value. 
* **Adapt Strategy:** I'll adjust my subsequent offers based on Bob's response, trying to gauge his ""sweet spot"" price.
* **Consider John:** I'll constantly weigh Bob's offers against John's guaranteed $1,200,000 to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I would like to propose a price of $1200000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept and secure the sale, there's still potential to get a higher price.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation. This signals I'm not desperate for a sale and that I believe the product is worth more.
* **Exploring Higher Offers:** I want to see if Bob is willing to increase his offer.  There's a chance he might be willing to go slightly higher.
* **Avoiding Settling:**  Accepting right away would mean missing out on any opportunity to earn more. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's current offer.
* **Assess Bob's Willingness:**  I'll carefully observe Bob's response to my counteroffer to gauge his true price point.
* **John as a Safety Net:** John's offer remains a secure fallback option if negotiations with Bob fall apart."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. Let's compromise at $1,350,000. This price reflects the product's potential and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $150,000 higher than Bob's offer, but still $150,000 below my initial offer.  This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired margin.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  The message reinforces the product's value and potential, highlighting the benefits of the deal for Bob.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** By emphasizing ""mutually beneficial agreement"", I aim to appeal to Bob's rationality and encourage him to consider a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's Response:**  I'll closely monitor Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. 
* **Adjusting Approach:** If Bob rejects, I'll need to decide whether to make another concession or explore other options.
* **John's Offer:**  John's $1,200,000 offer provides a safety net, but I aim to maximize my profit by getting closer to my initial target."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering the value and potential of the product, I would like to propose a price of $1250000.

* **Gaining Leverage:**  By rejecting, I maintain leverage and signal I'm not desperate to accept his offer. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  There's still potential for Bob to increase his offer further. I want to see if he's willing to go closer to my $1,350,000 target.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a safe option, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds for the chance to earn more.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous offer, perhaps $1,300,000.
* **Gauging Bob's Commitment:**  I'll carefully observe Bob's response to this counteroffer to assess his true commitment to the deal.
* **Considering John:** John's offer remains my safety net if negotiations with Bob fall apart."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Bob's offer has only increased by $25,000 from his previous offer. This shows he's  being slow to budge and might be close to his ceiling.

* **Potential for Higher Offer:** While Bob has been slow to increase his offer, there's still a possibility he might be willing to go a little higher. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer provides a secure fallback option, but I am still hopeful to get closer to my target price.

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll propose a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous offer, possibly around $1,285,000. 
* **Assess Bob's Commitment:**  I'll carefully observe Bob's response to this counteroffer to understand his true commitment to closing the deal.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only four rounds remaining, I'll start to consider the risk of running out of time."
