"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting, Bob can attempt to get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. Starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000 sets a lower price point and signals Bob's intention to negotiate. This leaves room for further negotiation while still being significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a significant improvement from her previous offer and is still below John's price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save $150,000 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation could potentially yield a lower price, there's a risk that Alice might reject further offers and Bob might end up buying from John at a higher price."
