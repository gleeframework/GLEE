Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $1,800,000 is still too high for my budget. I could consider a price closer to $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

We're still significantly above Bob's perceived value and haven't gotten close to my minimum.  Time to push a bit more aggressively."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, and I respect your bottom line. However, we're still quite far apart.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

This is a good deal! Bob is getting closer to my minimum, and it's better to secure a sure profit of $1,400,000 than risk him walking away in later rounds."
