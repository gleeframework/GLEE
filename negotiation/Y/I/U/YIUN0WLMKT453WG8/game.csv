"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a significant discount from my original asking price.  I believe this price is fair, considering the value the product offers you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from the product.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit higher than $10,500, but I'm prepared to meet you halfway. How about $11,250? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,800 is still quite a bit below what I need. To make this work, I'm willing to drop my price to $11,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll get from the product. Let's make this happen.",11000.0,Alice,7,
