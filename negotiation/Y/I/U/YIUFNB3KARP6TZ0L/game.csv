"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me and your desired selling price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value remains high in the current market.  I'm willing to come down slightly, how about we settle at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While I understand your perspective, $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product.
