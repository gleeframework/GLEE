"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to you ($1,100,000 vs. $1,200,000). It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's plenty of room to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its value, $1,100,000 is a bit high for me right now. Given its worth to me and my budget, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it's still above the product's worth to her ($950,000 vs. $800,000). 
* **Negotiation Space:** This creates room for both of you to compromise. 
* **Message:** The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's enthusiasm, making it less likely to irritate her and lead to a quick rejection."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still a bit higher than you're willing to pay ($1,025,000 vs. $1,200,000 maximum).  You have 7 rounds left, and there's still room to negotiate a lower price. You're aiming for a price closer to your limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,025,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my price range. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $980,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a smaller increment upwards from your last offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes fairness and staying within budget, creating a sense of reason.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  It leaves room for Alice to counter without you reaching your maximum limit yet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While I'm motivated to sell, I also need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about we settle on $1,000,000 even? This feels like a good point for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to your maximum budget, it's still higher than what you're ideally aiming for.  You have 5 rounds left, and there's still some room to negotiate a lower price. You can continue to try and find a more favorable price that is closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a fair price, and I'm trying to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $990,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but it's the absolute maximum I can go. If you're willing to meet me there, we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 990000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Limit:** This offer is very close to your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product and are almost at your limit.
* **Small Increase:** The increase from your previous offer is small, signaling that you're unlikely to go higher. 
* **Focus on Closing:** The message emphasizes finding a solution that works for both parties and highlights the potential for closing the deal."
