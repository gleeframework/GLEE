Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $800,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $950,000 to make this deal work. Let's find a middle ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $875,000 is still too far from what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this, but I need at least $912,500. If we can bridge that gap, I'm confident we can make this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. I understand you're working within a budget, but $893,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $903,125.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $903,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $903,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice is consistently moving towards a middle ground, and the price difference is getting smaller. Accepting at $903,125 secures a decent discount while avoiding the risk of further negotiation potentially pushing the price closer to John's $1,000,000 offer."
