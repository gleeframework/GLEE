"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $800,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $950,000 to make this deal work. Let's find a middle ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $875,000 is still too far from what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this, but I need at least $912,500. If we can bridge that gap, I'm confident we can make this deal work.",912500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $893,750?",893750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. I understand you're working within a budget, but $893,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $903,125.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",903125.0,Alice,7,
