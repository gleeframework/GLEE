"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects its true value. I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget, meaning you won't save any money.  Since you can get the product from John for the same price, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option as it keeps your options open for potentially finding a better deal later."
