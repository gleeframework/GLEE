"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. I think it's a great value for the features and benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value I'm bringing to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my maximum budget of $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price closer to my target.  There are still several rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to accept an offer that's still too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I'm limited to $13,000. It's a fair price given the value it brings to me, and it would save you the time and effort of finding another buyer.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is your limit, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $14,500. This is a fair price considering the value I'm bringing to the table, and it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, it's still above my maximum budget.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal with Alice, as we are both still committed to closing this deal. I also have the option to buy from John at a lower price, giving me a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm determined to acquire this product and I'm getting close to my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is a fair price for the value it brings to me.  This offer reflects our shared commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $13,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I'm bringing to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above my maximum budget of $12,000.  We've been negotiating for a while, and I'm not confident that we'll reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.  Since I have a guaranteed alternative with John at a lower price, I'll take that option to ensure I acquire the product at a price that works for me."
