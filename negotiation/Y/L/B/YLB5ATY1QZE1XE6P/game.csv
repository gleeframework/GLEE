"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value and rarity of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose an offer of $500000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm afraid $500000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1200000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I hope it's more in line with your expectations.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, Bob. However, $800000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make another adjustment to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1100000. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1000000 is still a bit too low for me. I've already gone above and beyond to meet you halfway, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to make a final offer of $1075000. This is my absolute limit, and I hope you can understand that. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
