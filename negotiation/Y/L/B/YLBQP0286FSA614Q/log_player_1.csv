Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a reasonable price:** It's above your minimum of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation and for Bob to feel he's getting a good deal.
* **It shows confidence:** Offering a price close to what you think it's worth demonstrates you're not desperate to sell. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're allowing for Bob to counteroffer, which keeps the negotiation process moving.

However, remember, this is just the beginning of the negotiation. Be prepared to counter Bob's offers, and always keep John's offer of $8,000 in mind as your ""safety net"" if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
