{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I'm confident it's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd accept from John, hoping to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $175 is a bit of a stretch, but it leaves room for negotiation and ensures I'm not underselling myself right away. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and confident to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $120. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150 and even below what Bob himself values the product at.
* **Negotiation is possible.** Although Bob's offer is low, there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my desired price point.
* **John is a backup.**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150 gives me leverage and allows me to be more assertive in my counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand your perspective, I'm unable to accept $120.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which still reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm counter-offering at $140, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a decent profit margin. 
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to subtly remind Bob that $120 is undervalueing it.
* **Open to Compromise:** The message ends on a positive note, suggesting a willingness to find a middle ground and reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $130 as my counteroffer. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not quite:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still $20 below my floor. 
* **Potential for a final counteroffer:** I believe there's still room for me to negotiate and get a price closer to $140.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $150, giving me leverage to hold out for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $130 is still a bit too low for me, considering the product's worth. However, I'm eager to make this deal work.  I'm willing to drop to $135. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm signaling that this is my last counteroffer. This puts pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Small Concession:**  I'm dropping by $5 from my previous offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my profit margin.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that even $135 is a fair price, considering the product's worth.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation open and avoid a breakdown."
