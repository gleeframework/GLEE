``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's a reasonable markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}

I'm offering a price of $17,500. This is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to show flexibility and encourage him to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a decent compromise and is within my acceptable range. It's a good deal for both of us and avoids further back and forth."
