``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price, considering my minimum value is $100. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully still get a good price. I'm also expressing confidence in the product's value to encourage Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value. While I want to make a deal, I can't sell the product for less than $100. I will counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $117.50? I'm still motivated to sell to you, but I need to get a fair price for this product."", ""product_price"": 117.50}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still holding firm on my value.  I'm also reaffirming my desire to make a deal with Bob to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $117.50 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $95. I'm getting closer to your price, and I'm really interested in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $105? That's a significant step towards your offer, and it's a fair price for this fantastic product. I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin. I'm also highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Let's split the difference at $98.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. But I'm not sure $98 is quite enough for me. Let's meet at $100. That's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures I can cover my costs.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering my minimum price, which is a fair price for me, and I'm expressing a willingness to close the deal. I'm hoping that this will be enough to convince Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm very close to accepting, but I'm still a little over budget.  How about $99?  That's just a dollar away from your offer, and I really want this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is only a dollar away from my minimum, I'm running out of time and don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  Selling to John for $100 guarantees I get my minimum value and ensures I don't lose out on the sale."
