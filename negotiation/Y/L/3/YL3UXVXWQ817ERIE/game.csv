"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $750,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping for.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's just above your minimum.  Let's make this deal happen.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not comfortable selling the product for less than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though - I'll sell it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",825000.0,Alice,5,
