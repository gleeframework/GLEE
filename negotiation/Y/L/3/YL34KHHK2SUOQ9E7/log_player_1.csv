Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product, which is a significant amount, but still within my financial limits. Let's start the negotiation from here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
