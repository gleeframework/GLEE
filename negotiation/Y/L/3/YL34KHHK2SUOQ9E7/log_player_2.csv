"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's crucial to start negotiating and try to bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product, which is a significant amount, but still within my financial limits. Let's start the negotiation from here."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:** Bob is starting with a strong counteroffer, immediately making it clear he's serious about negotiating and won't accept the initial price.
* **Fair but Firm:** $1,100,000 is halfway between Alice's initial price and Bob's maximum budget, showing he's willing to pay but not overpaying.
* **Justification:** The message provides a reason for the offer, emphasizing the value to Bob and suggesting room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the immense value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,900,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. There's still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to continue pushing for a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This reflects the product's value while staying within my financial constraints.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Push:** Bob is showing persistence by again rejecting Alice's offer and making a new counteroffer.
* **Fair Counter:** $1,500,000 is a significant increase from Bob's previous offer, showing he's willing to compromise but not overextend.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** The message focuses on finding a ""compromise,"" suggesting a willingness to work towards a mutually agreeable price."
