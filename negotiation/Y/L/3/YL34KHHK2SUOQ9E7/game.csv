"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product, which is a significant amount, but still within my financial limits. Let's start the negotiation from here.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the immense value it brings.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This reflects the product's value while staying within my financial constraints.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
