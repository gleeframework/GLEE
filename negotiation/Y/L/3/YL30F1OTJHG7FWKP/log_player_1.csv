"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe is worth a lot to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a relatively high price, but still below the maximum value I have for the product ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Building rapport:**  The message emphasizes the value to Bob, hopefully piquing his interest and opening the door to a negotiation. 
* **Room for counteroffers:** The price is not too aggressive, leaving space for Bob to counter without feeling like I'm being unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $14000 for the product. Let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:**  $14,000 is higher than my minimum value of $10,000. This means I have room to negotiate further.
* **Potential for a better deal:** There are still 8 rounds left. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price or at least find a price point that's more favorable to me. 
* **Not rushing into a deal:**  Selling to John for $10,000 would be a safe option, but I'm not desperate to sell right away.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and maintain leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $14,000 is still a little lower than where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $14,500. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm not giving in too much at this stage, keeping some room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes reaching a deal and finding common ground, creating a more collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget, I can consider purchasing the product for $14200. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** Bob's offer is still above my minimum price of $10,000. This gives me some room to potentially negotiate a higher price.
* **More rounds left:** With 6 rounds remaining, I'm not under pressure to accept a deal immediately. There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price point or even a higher offer.
* **Leveraging the negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the negotiation and explore if I can get a better deal. 
* **Not rushing:** Selling to John for $10,000 is a safety net, but I'm willing to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,200 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,350.  Let's finalize this deal and get you the product you need."", ""product_price"": 14350} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant increase:** I'm raising the price slightly, demonstrating I'm not willing to settle for a significantly lower price.
* **Emphasize value:**  The message re-emphasizes the value of the product to Bob and the benefits of completing the deal.
* **Collaborative tone:**  The language remains positive and focused on reaching an agreement. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** With 5 rounds left, I'm still not in a hurry to sell, so I can afford to be slightly firm with my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I am willing to pay $14300 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the product and my financial situation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my desired price:**  Bob's offer of $14,300 is only $50 less than my last counteroffer of $14,350.  This is a small difference and a good outcome for me.
* **Limited rounds left:** We are now down to 4 rounds left. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds. 
* **Potential for counteroffers:**  Even if I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob won't make a higher counteroffer.  
* **Minimizing risk:**  By accepting, I secure a price that is close to my desired range and significantly higher than selling to John."
