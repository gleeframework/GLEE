"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. Given its value, I'm offering it at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still above Alice's perceived value of the product ($12,000).  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be happy to offer you $13,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Compromise:** Bob is showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product by making a counteroffer. He's also demonstrating that he's willing to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:** $13,000 is a compromise between Alice's offer of $14,000 and Bob's ideal price. It's still above Alice's perceived value, giving her some room to negotiate.
* **Setting the Tone:**  This counteroffer establishes a reasonable starting point for future negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm confident this product is worth a significant investment. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:**  Even though Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting, Bob keeps the momentum going and signals his willingness to push for a better deal. 
* **Potential for Lower Price:**  Bob can likely get the price down to $13,000 or even lower with another counteroffer.
* **Avoiding Jhon:** Buying from Jhon at $15,000 is a last resort, and Bob wants to exhaust all other options before going that route."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $13,000. I'm ready to close the deal at that price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reiterating Position:** Bob is sticking to his previous counteroffer of $13,000, showing that he's serious about securing the product at this price.
* **Closing the Deal:** Bob is emphasizing that he's ready to finalize the purchase, increasing pressure on Alice to accept. 
* **Staying Within Budget:** $13,000 is still a significant saving compared to the initial offer and allows Bob to stay within his desired price range."
