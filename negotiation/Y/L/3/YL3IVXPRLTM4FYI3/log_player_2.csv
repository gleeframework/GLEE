"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this offer reflects a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her ($10,000), it's still lower than the price Bob would pay John ($12,000). Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option for Bob as it saves him $500 compared to buying from John."
