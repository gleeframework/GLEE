Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $2,000,000 is well above my budget.  Given my research and the market value, I'm comfortable offering $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
