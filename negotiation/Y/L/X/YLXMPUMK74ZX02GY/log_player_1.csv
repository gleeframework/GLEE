Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit high for me. How about $13,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
