I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be frank, $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,750,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but I think that's the maximum I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

At this point, Bob is unlikely to go much higher.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than risk Bob walking away."
