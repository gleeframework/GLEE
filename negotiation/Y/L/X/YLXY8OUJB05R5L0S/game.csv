"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be frank, $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,750,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but I think that's the maximum I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
