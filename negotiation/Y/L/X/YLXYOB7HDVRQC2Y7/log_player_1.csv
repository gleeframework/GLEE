Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $800,000. I'll counter with a lower price in the next round."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $775,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can do better. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $775,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $795,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. I'm only two rounds away from selling to John for $800,000, and I think I can get Bob to go a bit higher. I'll make one more counteroffer in the next round."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $805,000, but I'm still a bit away from my target. I'm willing to pay $795,000 for the product, but I'll meet you halfway at $802,500. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm only two rounds away from selling to John for $800,000.  I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John. There's no guarantee that Bob will come up to my price in the next round, and the risk is too high."
