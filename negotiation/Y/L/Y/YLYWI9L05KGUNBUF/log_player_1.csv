"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This reflects the product's value while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product is truly significant.  Would you consider $975,000?  This feels like a fair compromise to ensure you benefit from its potential."", ""product_price"": 975000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. Let's see if we can close the gap and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, the gap between his current offer ($925,000) and John's guaranteed offer ($1,000,000) is small enough that it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  It's time to secure the guaranteed profit."
