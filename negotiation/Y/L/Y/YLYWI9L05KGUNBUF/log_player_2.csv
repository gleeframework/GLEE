"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product is truly significant.  Would you consider $975,000?  This feels like a fair compromise to ensure you benefit from its potential.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. There's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price, potentially by making a counteroffer closer to $900,000."
