"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really love it. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that I feel comfortable with. I'm offering the product to you for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested in the product but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $10,000. It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your counter offer. While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you consider $7,500? I think that would be a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",8000.0,Alice,5,
