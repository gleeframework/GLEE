Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation without scaring him off.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $925,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **High Anchor:**  This initial price sets a high anchor point, making any subsequent counteroffers from Bob likely to be closer to our desired range.
* **Alternative Guarantee:** Knowing we have John as a backup at $800,000 gives us leverage. We're not desperate, but aiming for the best possible outcome with Bob."
