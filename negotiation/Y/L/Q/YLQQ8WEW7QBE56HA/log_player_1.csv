Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, offering it to Bob at a slightly lower price increases my chances of a quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $145 is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100), but it leaves room for negotiation if he tries to haggle.  
* **Time Value of Money:**  Selling the product quickly, even at a slight discount, can be more beneficial than waiting for a guaranteed sale at the highest price."
