{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for bargaining. It also frames the negotiation as a win-win scenario, which might make Bob more inclined to accept."
