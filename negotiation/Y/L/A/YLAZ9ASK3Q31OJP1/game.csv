"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going down to $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $13500? It's a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. Can you consider that?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11500 is a bit of a stretch for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet in the middle again? I can offer it to you for $13250. It's still a good deal for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $13250. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
