{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is only slightly lower than your initial offer and still above your minimum acceptable price. It's likely you won't get a better offer, and accepting it ensures a quick and profitable sale."
