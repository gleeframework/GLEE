"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've expressed interest in. My starting price is $110.  I think it's a great deal considering the value it offers."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to make him more inclined to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $65 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  While I need to be flexible, $65 is far below my minimum. I'm going to counter-offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $90? This is still a great deal, and I think we can find a win-win solution here."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $90 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more around $70. Would that be workable for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$70 is still below my minimum. I'm going to counter offer again, but I'm getting close to my breaking point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting closer to my limit here, but I'm still open to negotiating. $70 is still too low for me, how about we settle on $85?  I think that's a fair compromise considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close! I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm definitely interested in the product. How about we split the difference and settle at $77.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Although Bob is getting closer to my minimum,  I've already had a few rounds of back and forth, and we're still not at a price I'm comfortable with. It's better for me to sell to John for $100, as it's a guaranteed sale and meets my minimum."
