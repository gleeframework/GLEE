"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth at least $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! However, $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I get at least $10,500 for this product. How about we settle on that? It's still a great deal for you, considering its value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand where you're coming from. While it's a great product, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer. $9,750 is closer, but unfortunately, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'm offering $10,250. This price is fair, considering the value of the product to you. Let's finalize this deal.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference one more time and settle at $10,000 even?  That's a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,
