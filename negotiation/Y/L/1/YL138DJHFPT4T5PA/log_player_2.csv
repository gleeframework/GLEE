"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $13,500 is cheaper than John's offer, there's room for negotiation. Alice is starting higher than her product's worth to her, so there's a chance to get a better deal."
