Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than Bob's valuation, leaving room for negotiation.  It also adds a bit of excitement by mentioning the product's worth to me, subtly implying that it might be worth more than the price I'm offering.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While $125 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum valuation of $150.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $140.  That's a significant reduction from my initial price. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to cover your costs, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $130 is closer to my desired range, it's still below my minimum valuation of $150.  Instead of continuing to negotiate with Bob, I'll take the guaranteed $150 from John.  I've already spent enough time on this negotiation and John's offer is a safe and sure way to get the minimum I'm willing to accept."
