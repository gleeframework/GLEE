"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe $1,050,000 undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not convinced that $1,060,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $1,040,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1040000.0,Bob,6,
