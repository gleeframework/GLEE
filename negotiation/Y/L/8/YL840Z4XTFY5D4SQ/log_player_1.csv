Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not convinced that $1,060,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $1,040,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,040,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,040,000

}
``` 

At this point, Bob's offer of $1,040,000 is a significant profit. It's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer further or the negotiation reaching a stalemate."
