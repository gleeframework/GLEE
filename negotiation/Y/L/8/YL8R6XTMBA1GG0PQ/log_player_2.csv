"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm suggesting an offer of $120 for it. This price reflects both the cost of production and the high value this product holds for you based on my understanding. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
 
While $120 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell. By rejecting the offer, you might prompt a lower price from Alice or you can buy from John for $150."
