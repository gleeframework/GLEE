"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should aim for a lower price, potentially closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Rejecting allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  While I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement, $1,100,000 is below its true value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. This reflects its significance while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue negotiating and try to get a better price. There's still room for negotiation to potentially get closer to his target of $1,100,000."
