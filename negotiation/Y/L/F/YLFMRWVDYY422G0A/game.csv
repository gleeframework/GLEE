"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further if you're interested.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll offer you the product for $11,500. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and we can close the deal.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your offer of $11,000. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price. I'll offer you the product for $11,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
