I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 11500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
