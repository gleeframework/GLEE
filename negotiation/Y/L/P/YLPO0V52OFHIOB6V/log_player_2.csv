"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You're willing to pay up to $12,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is considerably lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still higher than my maximum budget of $12,000. While it's closer, I'm still willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can reach a fair price. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
