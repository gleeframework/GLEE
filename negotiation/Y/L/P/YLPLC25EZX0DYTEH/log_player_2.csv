"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, accepting Alice's offer of $900,000 is not ideal. Buying from John for $800,000 is also not ideal at this point because you might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  

The best strategy is to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price. This gives you a chance to get a deal closer to your $800,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $750,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $900,000 and puts us closer to my target price of $800,000. While it's a bold move, it shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll have a better idea of her flexibility and can adjust my next counteroffer accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to my target price, it's still above my limit. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating. There's a good chance I can get a better price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'm making a final counteroffer of $800,000. This is my absolute limit and it's a price that Alice should be willing to accept considering the product is worth the same to her. If she rejects this offer, I'll go ahead and buy from John at the same price."
