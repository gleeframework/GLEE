"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $11,500. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first.  $11,500 is too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

We start with a significant counteroffer to see Alice's reaction.  This offer is closer to Alice's value but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is below its value. Could you do $11,200? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to our desired price range, but we still have room to negotiate. We'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer closer to $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. How about we settle at $10,900? That's a fair compromise, I think."",

We're inching closer to a potential agreement. This counteroffer shows Alice we're willing to move, but we're still aiming for a price below $11,000."
