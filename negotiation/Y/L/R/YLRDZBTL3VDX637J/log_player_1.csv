Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. My initial price is $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the value you see in this product, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $10,000?  That gives us both some room to maneuver. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal here."", ""product_price"": 11000}
