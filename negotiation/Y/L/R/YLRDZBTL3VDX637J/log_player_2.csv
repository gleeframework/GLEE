"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. My initial price is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $12,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Negotiation:** There is room for negotiation as Alice values the product at $8,000.

**Next Steps:** Bob should reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the value you see in this product, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $10,000?  That gives us both some room to maneuver."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible, but still acquire the product.
* **Alice's Offer:** $11,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant discount from the initial $12,000.
* **Negotiation:** While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will become unwilling to lower the price further.

**Next Steps:**  Accepting Alice's offer is the most prudent choice at this stage. It allows Bob to acquire the product within his budget and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation or the potentially higher cost of buying from John."
