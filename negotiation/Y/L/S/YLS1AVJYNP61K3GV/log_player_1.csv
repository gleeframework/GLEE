Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I open it up to other potential buyers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to your minimum ($1,200,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer while still exceeding your reserve price. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Mentioning other potential buyers creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob might counter-offer lower than $1,100,000. Be prepared to negotiate but hold firm to your $1,200,000 minimum.
* **John as a Guarantee:** Having John as a backup buyer ensures you'll sell the product for at least your minimum price."
