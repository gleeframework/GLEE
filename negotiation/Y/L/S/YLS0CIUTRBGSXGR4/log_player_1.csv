"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is significantly higher than what you're proposing.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of its worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a firm budget. I can go up to $700,000. That's a significant investment on my part and a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is increasing his offer, we're still significantly below the product's value to us and what John is offering.  We have room to negotiate and time before the guaranteed sale to John becomes the more appealing option."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To show I'm flexible, I'm willing to accept $850,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to see this product in your hands."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you coming down, but I'm aiming for something below $800,000.  Would you consider $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is inching closer to his true valuation but is still significantly under our minimum and John's offer.  We're getting into the later rounds, but we can afford to push Bob a bit further to see if he'll increase his offer significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but the product's value is truly non-negotiable below a certain point. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair considering the product's potential."", 
""product_price"": 825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's time to start applying pressure and signal that our price is firming up.  By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and might incentivize Bob to make a significant jump or reveal how much he's truly willing to pay. We're also leaving room to accept a counteroffer slightly above $800,000 if Bob comes close."
