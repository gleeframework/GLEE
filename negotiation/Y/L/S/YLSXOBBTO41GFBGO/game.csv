"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more like $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,800? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,800 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,200?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your point, but I'm still a bit uncomfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,800 and $9,200, which would be $9,000. Would you be willing to accept this price?",9000.0,Bob,6,
