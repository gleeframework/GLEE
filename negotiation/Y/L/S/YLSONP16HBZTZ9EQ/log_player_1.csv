"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm also aware of John's offer of $12,000, which is my absolute minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is too low for me. I'll counteroffer in the next round, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $13,000. This is still above my minimum price of $12,000, and I'm hoping it's attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$11,000 is still a bit low, but I'm getting closer. I'll counteroffer again in the next round.  However, I'm getting closer to John's offer, so I'm keeping my options open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm going to offer $12,500. It's a significant decrease from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum price of $12,000. With only 5 rounds left, I need to be more aggressive to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although $11,500 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round, but if I don't see a significant improvement, I might take John's offer in the next round to ensure I don't miss out completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm going to make my final counteroffer at $12,000.  This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm willing to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't accept.  With only three rounds left, I need to be firm and make a clear decision."
