# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $140, which is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is higher than your maximum budget of $120. You know you can get the product for $120 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move to John and secure a better price."
