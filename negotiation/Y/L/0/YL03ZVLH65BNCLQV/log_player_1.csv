Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1000000. Can we discuss further?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get a better price. I'll try to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This reflects the unique value of this product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product is valuable, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1000000 and $1250000, which would be $1125000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,125,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can do better. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,125,000 is still below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down slightly more to $1,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think that $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can do better. We are only on round 6, and I have 4 more rounds to negotiate. I'll try to push for a higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,150,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1150000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1100000 and $1150000, which would be $1125000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are on round 8, and Bob is still not willing to go higher than $1,125,000.  I've already spent several rounds trying to push for a higher price, and I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting his offers, he might walk away. 

Considering that I only have two more rounds left, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. While this is not my ideal price, it is still a significant amount of money and a secure deal.  It's better to accept a guaranteed $1,000,000 than risk losing the deal completely with Bob."
