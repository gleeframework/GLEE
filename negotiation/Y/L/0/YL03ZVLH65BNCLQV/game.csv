"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1000000. Can we discuss further?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1000000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This reflects the unique value of this product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is valuable, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1000000 and $1250000, which would be $1125000. Can we discuss further?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1125000 is still below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down slightly more to $1200000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of this product and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think that $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can we meet at this price?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1150000. This is a fair price that recognizes your budget while still allowing me to make a decent profit. I'm confident this is a price we can both agree on.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
