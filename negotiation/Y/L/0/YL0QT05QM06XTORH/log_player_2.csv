You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, I can explore the possibility of a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This would still be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I am happy to provide you with a counteroffer. For the product, I am now willing to negotiate at $14,200. This price reflects a compromise while still ensuring a reasonable profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $14,200, which is only $200 more than my counteroffer. At this point, it's likely that further negotiation won't get me a significantly better deal. It's worth accepting this offer to secure the product at a decent price and avoid the risk of further back-and-forth with Alice."
