"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's not worth buying the product from Alice for $1,200,000 when you can get it from John for $1,000,000.  It's better to reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $900,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it's still a reasonable price considering I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  I'm hoping Alice will be willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Alice's offer is still higher than what John is selling for.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if we can get a better price."

I'm going to increase my counteroffer to $950,000. This is still lower than Alice's offer, but it's getting closer to what I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping that Alice will be willing to meet me halfway."
