"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is still attractive to Bob, considering it's below his perceived value. However, it's also close enough to my minimum that I can potentially gain a decent profit. I'm hoping to close the deal quickly, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am interested in purchasing your product, but I can only pay up to $12,000. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between these prices? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is a decent profit, it's still below my minimum desired value for the product. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to try and reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Would $12,500 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm willing to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. Would $13,000 be within your consideration? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with the price.  $13,000 is getting closer, but I want to see if I can get a little more. There are still several rounds left and I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your persistence. $13,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there. How about we compromise at $13,250? This feels like a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offers, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I believe $13,000 would be a fair price for both of us. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting a bit frustrating. Bob is being stubborn and refusing to budge. We're only two rounds away from my deadline, and I'm starting to worry I won't get a price I'm comfortable with. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  I can get my desired price with him and avoid further negotiations."
