"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, it's significantly lower than what I need to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $850000. This is a fair compromise, and it still reflects the true value of the product. Let's see if we can close the deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $725000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $775000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to find common ground. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we may be too far apart. While I'm still interested in working with you, $750000 is simply not enough for me. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. My absolute lowest price is $790000. This is a significant compromise, and I hope you'll reconsider. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to other opportunities.",790000.0,Alice,7,
