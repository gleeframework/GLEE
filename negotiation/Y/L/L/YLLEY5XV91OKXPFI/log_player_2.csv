"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's initial value, Bob can potentially save more by negotiating.  There's room for Alice to lower her price, and Bob can use the option of buying from John as leverage in the negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1250000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his maximum. While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is lower than her initial price, Bob can still potentially negotiate a better deal. There's a chance he can get Alice closer to his desired price of $1,250,000 or at least to a price that makes it more appealing to him compared to John's offer."
