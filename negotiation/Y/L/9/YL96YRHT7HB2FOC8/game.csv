"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $9,500?  This still represents a great deal for you, and it allows me to move closer to my goal.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. Can you consider this revised offer?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer!  However, $9,250 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,400.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",9400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that we're close, but $9,400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,300. Can you consider this revised offer?",9300.0,Bob,6,
