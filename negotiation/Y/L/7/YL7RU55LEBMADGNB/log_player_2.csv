# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a highly valuable product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $1500000 for this exceptional item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, there's no reason to accept it immediately. You can try to negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance Alice may be willing to drop the price to secure a sale, especially if she's not sure of the product's true value to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested, but I'm not sure I can justify that price right now.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,250,000? I believe this is a fair price given the value I see in this product. "", ""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, signaling your seriousness about negotiation while leaving room for potential compromise. It also includes a justification for your offer, potentially appealing to Alice's desire to make a quick sale."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1375000. This is a fair compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product, while also taking into account your concerns about the initial price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price and is now offering a price that's still well within my budget. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice could become unwilling to compromise further. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a good price without risking losing it to John."
