"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $850,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $800,000.  This price reflects the value to me, while still leaving you a good profit. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000. I've already compromised a lot by coming down from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $825,000. This is a final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
