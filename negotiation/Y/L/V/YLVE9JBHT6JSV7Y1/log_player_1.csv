Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

This is a good point to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Meeting Your Minimum:** Bob's offer matches your absolute minimum acceptable price. 
* **Stronger Position Later:** While you could try to push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher and you risk him walking away. Accepting now secures your minimum. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now prevents potential delays or complications that could arise in further negotiation rounds."
