Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}

This offer is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  It also demonstrates that you're serious about selling, but not desperate to accept his potential full value offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still a good deal, but it's worth trying to get a bit closer to my desired price before potentially selling to John. I'll counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,450,000. This is still below Bob's potential value, but it shows I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely that further negotiation won't get me much closer to my desired price. It's time to secure the deal."
