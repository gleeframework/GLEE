Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it gives me a margin to work with while still being potentially attractive to Bob. If he rejects, I can then assess his counteroffer and decide whether to negotiate further or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to pay this price.  If he rejects, I'll have to reconsider my options and decide whether to sell to John or continue negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $12,000. I will reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,500. This is a compromise between my minimum price and Bob's latest offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping that Bob will finally accept. If he doesn't, I will seriously consider selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I've already made several compromises. I'm not convinced that further negotiation will get me a higher price, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $12,000 from John. I'm going to sell to John."
