"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really like. I'm asking $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is overpriced at $95. You can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price."
