"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $130, which is a good starting point for negotiation. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100, but leaves room for compromise and allows me to potentially secure a higher price if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $130 is a bit more than I was hoping for. How about $115?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is better than selling to John, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $115 is a little low for me.  How about we split the difference at $122.50? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 122.50} 
``` 
 
I'm offering a price of $122.50. This is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's, which shows willingness to compromise while still trying to get a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $122.50 is still a little high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $120.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I need to keep it within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is close to my desired price and better than selling to John.  I'm happy to accept this offer."
