"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in your product, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $12,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $13,500?  I'm sure we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
