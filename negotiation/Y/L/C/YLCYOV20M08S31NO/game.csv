"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $16,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",16000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $20,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $18,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you at $17,000.  If that's not acceptable, I'm going to have to look at other options.",17000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $17,000. I'm willing to meet you at $18,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",18500.0,Alice,5,
