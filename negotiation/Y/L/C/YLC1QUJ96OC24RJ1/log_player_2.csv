# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you at a price of $950,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, but I'm willing to make an exception for you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and make a counteroffer of $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

At this point, Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate but is firming up her bottom line.  $825,000 is a reasonable price and further haggling might irritate her and make her less likely to negotiate."
