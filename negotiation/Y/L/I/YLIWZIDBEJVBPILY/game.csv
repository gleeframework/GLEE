"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $85 right now.  Let me know if that works for you.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $85.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. How about $100? That's a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
