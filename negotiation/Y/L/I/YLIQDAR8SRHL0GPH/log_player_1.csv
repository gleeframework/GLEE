Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and the demand I've received, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it for $12,000 (my guaranteed sale price), there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay a bit more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price positions the product as high-value to Bob, but still potentially more attractive than losing the opportunity."
