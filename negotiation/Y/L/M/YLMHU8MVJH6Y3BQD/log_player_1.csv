Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $60 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet halfway? I can let it go for $110."", ""product_price"": 110}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I could go up to $75, but that's the most I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's clear that Bob is not willing to budge much higher than $75. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $120, it makes no sense to continue negotiating with Bob. It's time to cut your losses and sell to John."
