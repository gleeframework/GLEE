"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering the potential benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a significant discount, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can justify.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while ensuring I can make a good return on my investment. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. I believe the product's value to you justifies this price, and I'm willing to work with you to make it happen. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
