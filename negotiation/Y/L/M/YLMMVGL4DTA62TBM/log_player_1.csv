Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to my operations. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

While $1,600,000 is a significant sum, I'm confident this product's true value is considerably higher, especially considering the potential benefits it offers your operations.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still looking to stay within a specific budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to my operations. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'd like to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price. It's always possible to hold out for more, but there's also the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away altogether. This offer represents a good balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal."
