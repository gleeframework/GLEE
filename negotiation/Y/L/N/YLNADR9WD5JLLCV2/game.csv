"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, your initial price is a little high for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,000,000, but I believe the product's value is worth more than that. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $900,000. I'm still a bit hesitant to accept that price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $950,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,5,
