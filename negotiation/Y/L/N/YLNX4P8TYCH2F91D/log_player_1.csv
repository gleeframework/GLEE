Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. I think it's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Let me know if this is something you can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $110? It's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I am still looking for a deal that suits my budget. I am willing to pay $95 for the product. I hope this aligns with your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and while I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk going too low.  Selling to John for $100 guarantees me my minimum price and saves me time."
