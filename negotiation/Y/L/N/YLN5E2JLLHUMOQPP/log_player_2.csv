"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is way above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $12,000 right now. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $12,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to facilitate this deal. It's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $16,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price. He should continue negotiating to try and get a better price. There are still rounds left, and Bob has the option of buying from John if he can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is my absolute lowest price, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and its potential benefits for you. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $15,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget.  With only 5 rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice is high.  Instead of continuing to negotiate, Bob should take the guaranteed deal from John for $10,000. This allows him to secure the product at his desired price and avoids the possibility of a drawn-out negotiation that might not result in a successful purchase."
