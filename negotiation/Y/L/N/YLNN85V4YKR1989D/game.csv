"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1200000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I can do $1100000, which is very close to my minimum price. I'm not sure I can go any lower than this. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum price, Bob. I've already made a significant concession by offering it to you for $1100000. I'm not willing to give it away, but I'm willing to meet you at $1050000. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your minimum price, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options, including buying the product from a competitor.",980000.0,Bob,10,
