{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you value it at $12,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum value of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if he doesn't, I'm prepared to counteroffer and potentially deal with John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. It's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is closer to my minimum but I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,750. This would still be a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than your estimated value. Let's close this deal and both be happy."", ""product_price"": 9750}
