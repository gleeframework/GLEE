Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer is a starting point.  It's above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. Bob's value for the product is $1,000,000, so this offer gives him some room to counter-offer, while still being profitable for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below your minimum acceptable price.  While you could sell to John for $800,000, it's worth trying to get closer to your desired price with Bob.  A counteroffer will give you more control over the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's above Bob's offer of $750,000, but still lower than your initial offer of $950,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still maintaining a price that is closer to your desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $780,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  It's worth pushing for a higher price.  You can make a counteroffer to bridge the gap between the two offers, or if it seems unlikely Bob will go higher, you can sell to John.  However, you are still better off trying to reach a better deal with Bob than accepting his current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000} 
```

This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer of $875,000 and Bob's latest offer of $780,000.  This demonstrates flexibility while still pushing for a price closer to your desired value.  It's a good chance Bob will find this a fair compromise, but if he rejects, you can still opt to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, Bob's offer of $790,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While you could continue negotiating with Bob,  it's likely that the negotiations will become lengthy and may not result in a better price. John is offering a guaranteed $800,000, which meets your minimum requirement and saves you the time and uncertainty of further negotiations."
