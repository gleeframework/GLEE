{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's significantly higher than your minimum, giving you room to negotiate down if needed. It's also a price that's still attractive to Bob, as it's well below his estimated value. This strategy aims to secure a good deal while leaving room for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  That's a significant increase from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $775,000 is still too low. How about we split the difference at $812,500? That's a fair price that would allow both of us to walk away happy. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 812500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about $790,000? I'm trying to be mindful of my budget.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price point, Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. It's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing out on a sure thing. I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000."
