"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. While $95 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a great deal on a fantastic product, and I think you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
You should buy the product from John for $100.  You're already at your maximum price point of $100 and Alice is still above it. There's no need to continue negotiating and risk Alice going back up in price or you wasting time."
