{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $115. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a positive tone, emphasizing that I believe Bob will appreciate the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm really looking to stay under $100. I'd be happy to pay $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will reject his offer and attempt to counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. While $95 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a great deal on a fantastic product, and I think you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
