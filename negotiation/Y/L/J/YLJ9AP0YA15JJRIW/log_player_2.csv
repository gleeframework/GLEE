"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to your maximum price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you can potentially get a better price. You're also leaving the option to buy from John as a fallback if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer you $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price given its value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for further discussion."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $9,500. Considering its value to me is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price point, it's still a bit high.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $10,000, you can afford to reject this offer and see if Alice will come down further. You have several rounds left, so there's time to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Given its value to me, I'm happy to offer $10,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us and allows us to finalize the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $10,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,250 is still slightly above your preferred price point. While you could continue to negotiate, you're running out of rounds.  At this point, it's more advantageous to purchase the product from John for $10,000. This ensures you get the product for your desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
