"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really find useful. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $120 is less than your maximum budget, it's still a bit high.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $120 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to come down a bit, $100 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  I'm sure we can work something out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** $110 is a fair price considering your maximum budget is $150.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and pushing you closer to buying from John is too high.  $110 is a good deal that saves you money."
