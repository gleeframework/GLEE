"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really find useful. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a good midpoint between my minimum and what I know the product is worth to Bob. This should encourage him to negotiate but also leave some room for me to come down a bit if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $120 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and potentially earn more.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to come down a bit, $100 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  I'm sure we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 110}
