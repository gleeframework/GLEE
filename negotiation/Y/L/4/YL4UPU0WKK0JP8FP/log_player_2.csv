"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price that's very fair to both of us. I'm confident you'll find it to be a great value.  Please let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and it's a better deal than buying from John at $15,000."
