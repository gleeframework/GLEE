Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $11,000 is too low for me, considering I value the product at $10,000. I'll see if I can get a better price from Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $15,000 to you. Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, $11,750 is still too low. I believe I can get a better deal in the next round or sell to John for $10,000 if necessary."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,750.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,125? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12125}

Round 6
