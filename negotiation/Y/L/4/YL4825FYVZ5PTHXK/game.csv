,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, the proposed price is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'd be interested in discussing a price closer to $800,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects my budget constraints while still recognizing the product's potential.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider a price of $1,400,000?  I believe this fairly reflects the value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we perhaps agree on $950,000? This offer keeps us moving closer to a workable figure.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm motivated to find an agreement, $950,000 remains below its true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This offer reflects the value while acknowledging our negotiations.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I understand the product's value, but to be realistic for my budget, I can offer $1,050,000. I'm hoping this demonstrates my seriousness about closing a fair deal.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are getting closer.  I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to accept $1,150,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
