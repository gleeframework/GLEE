Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we are getting closer.  I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to accept $1,150,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.

Alice is unlikely to budge much further from her final offer. While getting the product for $1,050,000 would be ideal, it's too risky to continue the negotiation. John provides a guaranteed option at your maximum budget."
