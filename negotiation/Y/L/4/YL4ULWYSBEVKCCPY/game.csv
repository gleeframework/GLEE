"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,
