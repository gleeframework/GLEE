Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This initial offer is a bit high, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest. If he's interested, he'll likely make a counteroffer.  If he isn't interested, I can always move on to John and still get my minimum asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a price closer to my desired value. I'll counteroffer and see where things go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $85 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $80, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum asking price. While I'd prefer to get more, I'm happy to accept this offer since it's a fair deal for both of us. It also avoids the risk of having to sell to John for the same price and potentially losing out on a sale."
