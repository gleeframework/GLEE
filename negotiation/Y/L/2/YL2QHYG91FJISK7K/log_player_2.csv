"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm only willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I value your interest, $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $10,800 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer of $10,800 is still higher than what you are willing to pay. You can get the product from John for $10,000, so it's best to just buy it from him and avoid further negotiations."
