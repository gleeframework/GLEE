"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $875,000, which is closer to our respective valuations and allows for a fair deal. Let's try to find common ground here.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $912,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. What do you think?",912500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $912,500 is still too high for me.  While I value this product, it's important for us to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go to $890,000, which is a fair compromise considering both our valuations and the potential for a long-term partnership.  Let's make this deal happen.",890000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $890,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you halfway between $912,500 and $890,000, which is $901,250. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. What do you think?",901250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $901,250 is still a bit out of my range.  We're getting closer, though. I'm willing to offer $895,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects our respective valuations and allows us to move forward with this deal. I hope we can reach an agreement within this round, as time is of the essence.",895000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $895,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'll offer the product to you for $910,000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. What do you think?",910000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're almost there. I appreciate you coming down in price, but $910,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  If you're serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that considers both our valuations. Let's finalize this and move forward.",900000.0,Bob,10,
