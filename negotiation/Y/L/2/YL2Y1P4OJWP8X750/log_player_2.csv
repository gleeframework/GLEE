"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $900,000 is significantly above Alice's valuation of $800,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** There's room for negotiation since you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $800,000. 
* **Exploring better options:** Rejecting the offer allows you to explore a counteroffer that could be more favorable."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's original offer, but still higher than her valuation.  It shows you're serious about negotiating.
* **Motivating Alice:** This counteroffer gives Alice a reason to accept, as it's closer to her target price than her initial offer. 
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  If Alice rejects this offer, you can still adjust your counteroffer in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:**  $925,000 is still above the mid-point between your target price ($1,200,000) and Alice's valuation ($800,000).
* **Continuing to negotiate:**  By rejecting, you show Alice you're serious about getting a better price, and you can make a counteroffer that is closer to your target.
* **Avoiding immediate purchase:** Buying from John at $1,200,000 is still a much higher price than you're hoping for.

**Next Steps:** You'll need to make another counteroffer that is lower than $925,000, but still fair and potentially attractive to Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $875,000, which is closer to our respective valuations and allows for a fair deal. Let's try to find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Alice's valuation:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from the previous round but still above Alice's valuation, showing a commitment to reaching a compromise.
* **Signaling seriousness:**  By making a concession, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate seriously and find a mutually agreeable solution. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price still allows for further negotiation, as you're aiming for a price lower than $875,000.  

This counteroffer is a balanced move that aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while still protecting your interests."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $912,500 is still too high for me.  While I value this product, it's important for us to find a price that works for both of us.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $901,250 is still a bit out of my range.  We're getting closer, though. I'm willing to offer $895,000 for the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're almost there. I appreciate you coming down in price, but $910,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.

* **Emphasis on finality:**  Stating that this is your ""final offer"" adds pressure and encourages Alice to make a decision quickly.

**Why this counteroffer could work:**

* **Alice's desire to close the deal:** With only one round remaining, Alice might be more inclined to accept your offer to avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely.
* **The pressure of John's offer:** Alice knows you have another option, which makes her more willing to consider your final offer.
* **Finding common ground:** $900,000 is a price that offers both you and Alice a reasonable profit and allows for a successful transaction."
