"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1500000.  This is a very competitive price, given the value and potential of this product. I'm confident it will be a lucrative investment for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. This is a more reasonable price for me, considering the market value of similar products.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise, but  I'm confident this product will bring you much higher returns.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm offering $1200000. This price reflects the product's potential and is still a great value for you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900000. This is a fair price considering the market value and the potential returns I can expect from the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer,  $900000 is still not a price that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm confident it has the potential to generate significantly more returns for you. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering $1050000. This is a fair compromise and I'm sure you'll find it a very worthwhile investment.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're confident in the product's potential, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $950000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $950000 still undervalues the potential of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm offering $1000000. This price is fair and reflects the value you'll receive from this investment. Let's close the deal and make this a win-win for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to pay $1000000. I'm willing to go up to $975000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential returns I can expect from the product.",975000.0,Bob,8,
