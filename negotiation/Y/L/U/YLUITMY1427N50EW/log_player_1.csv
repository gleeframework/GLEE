{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,500,000.  This is a very competitive price, given the value and potential of this product. I'm confident it will be a lucrative investment for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. This is a more reasonable price for me, considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is better than my minimum acceptable price, I'm aiming for a higher profit margin.  Bob's offer is too low, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise, but  I'm confident this product will bring you much higher returns.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm offering $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's potential and is still a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900000. This is a fair price considering the market value and the potential returns I can expect from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$900,000 is still below my desired price, but it's getting closer. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since I'm still within the early rounds and have plenty of opportunity to negotiate.  I'm not ready to settle yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer,  $900,000 is still not a price that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm confident it has the potential to generate significantly more returns for you. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise and I'm sure you'll find it a very worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're confident in the product's potential, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $950000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to settle yet. We've only had 6 rounds and I still have some room to negotiate.  I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since Bob has indicated he's willing to compromise."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $950,000 still undervalues the potential of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm offering $1,000,000. This price is fair and reflects the value you'll receive from this investment. Let's close the deal and make this a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to pay $1000000. I'm willing to go up to $975000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential returns I can expect from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final few rounds, and Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While $975,000 is better than his previous offer, I'm not willing to risk getting stuck with a lower price. There's a good chance Bob might not budge any further, and I don't want to waste any more time negotiating.  It's better to secure the guaranteed price from John and move on."
