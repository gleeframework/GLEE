,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. I'm interested in the product, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a good deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm glad we're having a conversation. However, $10,000 is a bit lower than I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,500.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. $11,000 is getting closer to my target, but I still need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you at $12,250, which is a compromise that works for both of us. I think you'll find it's worth it.",12250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see we're getting closer, but $12,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $11,750. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",11750.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. $11,750 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,375. This is a fair price that should make both of us happy.",12375.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me. I'm still not quite there with $12,375.  Let's try $12,000. It's a fair compromise, and we can both close this deal. ",12000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. $12,000 is a good price, but I'm not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, which is a fair price that I think you'll agree is worth it for this product.",12500.0,Alice,9,
