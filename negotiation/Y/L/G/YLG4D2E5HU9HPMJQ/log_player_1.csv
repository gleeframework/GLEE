"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product will be of great value to you and I'm pleased to offer it to you for $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a high initial offer, significantly above my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This achieves a few things:

* **Anchoring:**  It sets a high reference point for the negotiation. Even if unrealistic, it influences Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Room for Negotiation:** It gives me space to make concessions throughout the rounds, appearing flexible while still aiming for a high profit. 
* **Information Gathering:** Bob's response to this high price will provide insight into his negotiation style and how badly he wants the product. 

While I have a standing offer from John, it's strategically better to explore the potential for a higher profit with Bob in these early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but that price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's counteroffer is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value. This suggests he's aiming for a very aggressive deal.  While I want to be flexible, accepting this offer would be a substantial loss.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, so I will reject and prepare a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than your current offer. Let's find a compromise. How about $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm coming down significantly from my initial price, signaling willingness to negotiate but not desperation. 
* **Above Minimum:** This counteroffer is still comfortably above my $1,000,000 minimum, leaving room for further concessions if needed.
* **Testing the Waters:** This price point will help gauge Bob's flexibility. His response will indicate if he's willing to move closer to a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations. I can offer $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but he's still significantly below my minimum. This indicates a few things:

* **He's definitely interested:** He wouldn't keep negotiating if he wasn't.
* **He's a tough negotiator:**  He's likely trying to see how low I'll go. 
* **He might have more room to move:**  His increases have been relatively small. 

I need to show him I'm willing to walk away if he doesn't make a substantial jump. Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on him. I'll use my next counteroffer to test his resolve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitancy on your end.  I need you to be realistic about the value this product offers.  My final offer is $950,000.  This is my absolute bottom line."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** I'm making it clear that this is my best and final offer.  This creates a sense of urgency and signals that I'm willing to walk away from the deal.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  I'm dropping below $1,000,000, but staying close to my minimum. This might be enough to entice Bob while still securing a profit above John's offer. 
* **Limited Time:** With only five rounds left, I'm putting a time constraint on Bob's decision-making.  This might push him to accept or make a significant counteroffer to avoid losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but that price is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.  My final offer is $825,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is unlikely to budge:** He's met me halfway, signaling this is likely his ceiling. 
* **Opportunity cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer.  
* **Minimal gains vs. risk:**  Even if I could squeeze a bit more from Bob, it's unlikely to be significantly more than $825,000.  The potential gain is not worth the risk of losing John's offer.

It's time to cut my losses with Bob. Accepting John's offer ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
