"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's valued at $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1400000 to get this deal going.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1200000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1200000 is simply too low for me.  It's a great product and I need to recoup some of my investment. How about we split the difference and try $1300000? I'm confident this price will be beneficial for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1250000 still falls short of what's fair for me.  To make progress, I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This price allows us both to find some common ground and get this deal done.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm still not comfortable with $1275000, but I'm committed to finding a solution.  How about we split the difference once more and try $1325000?  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while also giving you a great deal.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
