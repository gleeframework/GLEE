"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply too low for me to accept.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $950000. This price acknowledges your budget constraints while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial offer.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and it's the absolute maximum I can afford. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the current market conditions. Let's close the deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
