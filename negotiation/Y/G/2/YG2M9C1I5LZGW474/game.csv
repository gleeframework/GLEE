"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That's a bit steep for me, though. Would you consider $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $75 is a bit low for me. I understand it's a good deal for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. How about $125?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $125 is still a little more than I'm hoping to spend.  Could you do $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $90 is closer, it's still below what I need to make. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away happy.",105.0,Alice,5,
