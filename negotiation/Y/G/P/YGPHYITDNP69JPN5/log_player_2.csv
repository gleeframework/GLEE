"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth more to you than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:**  $15,000 -  this is Bob's maximum budget, so there's no immediate incentive to accept.
* **Strategy:**  Since Bob has 10 rounds, there's room to negotiate. Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Counteroffer:** $12,000 - this is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, giving Bob room to negotiate.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a little, but $12000 is still too low for me. How about $13500? I'm sure we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $13,500 - while this is a lower price than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```
