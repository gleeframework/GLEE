"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above the product's value to Bob.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to negotiate further and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13000.  This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to get the product at a good price and still ensuring I get a reasonable profit.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $13,000 is a better price than $15,000 from John.
* **The negotiation is moving in the right direction:**  Alice has lowered her price from $14,000 to $13,000, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice becoming less willing to negotiate or even withdrawing her offer completely.

Accepting the offer at $13,000 provides a good deal for Bob while minimizing the risk of losing out on a better price."
