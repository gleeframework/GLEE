"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a price that I think is a great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product.  Alice's offer of $9,500 is a good deal, but you can still do better.  Since you can get the product from John for $10,000, there's no need to accept Alice's offer.  You can use this knowledge to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice."
