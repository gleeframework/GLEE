"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still leaves room for both of us to profit. Let's try to find a compromise here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to see you're willing to come up on your offer, but $975,000 is still a bit below what I need. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,012,500. I'm confident that this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,012,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",990000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'll come down to $1,000,000. That's a fair price considering its value to you, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know if you're ready to finalize the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
