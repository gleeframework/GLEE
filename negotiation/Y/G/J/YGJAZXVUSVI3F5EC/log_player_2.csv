"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product has great potential for your company, and I'm confident it's worth a significant investment.  I'm offering it to you at $1,250,000.  This price reflects its value and allows for a profitable margin for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but Alice is asking for $1,250,000. There is room for negotiation.
* **You want to save as much money as possible.** Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This price reflects a fair value for both of us, and allows for a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. While I'm open to negotiating, I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to your desired price.**  $1,150,000 is still higher than your ideal price, but it's within your budget and significantly lower than John's price.
* **There's a risk of further negotiation.** If you reject Alice's offer, she might increase the price again, potentially making it too expensive for you.
* **Accepting the offer saves you money and secures the product.** It's a good deal considering the alternative (buying from John at a higher price)."
