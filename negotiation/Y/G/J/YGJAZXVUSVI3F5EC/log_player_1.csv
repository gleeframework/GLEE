Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This price reflects a fair value for both of us, and allows for a smooth transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
