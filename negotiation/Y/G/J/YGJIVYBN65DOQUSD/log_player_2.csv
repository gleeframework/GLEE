"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that I believe is fair to both of us. Based on its potential value to you, I'm asking for $1,200,000. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,500,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or move on to John's offer and secure a better deal."
