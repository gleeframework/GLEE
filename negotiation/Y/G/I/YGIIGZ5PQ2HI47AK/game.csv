"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1600000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1450000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering both our perspectives.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1450000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1550000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me. I'm also keeping in mind that I have other interested buyers, so I'm willing to make a slightly higher offer to close the deal quickly.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to hear you're considering closing the deal quickly. $1550000 is still a bit higher than what I can realistically afford. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to pay $1500000, which is a fair price given the product's value to me and your desire for a quick sale.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
