{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's still beneficial for me, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if he rejects, I can then assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing to negotiate with him or selling to John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than his own assessment of the product's value. I'm not willing to sell at that price yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  That's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $8,750 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,375. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,375 is closer to my desired price, it's still lower than the value I've placed on the product. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not ready to accept this offer yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my ideal price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $8,375 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about we settle on $9,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it'll save us both some time."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I would prefer to earn more for the product, Bob is not willing to meet my price point. At this stage, selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me the highest return.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially lose out on a guaranteed sale to John."
