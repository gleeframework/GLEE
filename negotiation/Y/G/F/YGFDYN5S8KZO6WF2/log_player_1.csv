I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell now, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $8,000 by continuing the negotiation."

Bob is getting increasingly stubborn, and I'm not confident I'll be able to get a better price from him.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
