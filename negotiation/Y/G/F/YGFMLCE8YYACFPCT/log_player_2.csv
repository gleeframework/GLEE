"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great opportunity to get an exclusive product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price.  $900,000 is still too high for Bob's budget.  Let's see if we can get Alice to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  $875,000 is closer to Bob's budget, but he can likely get it for even less.  Let's see if we can get Alice to come down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $875,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that $825,000 would be a fair price for both of us.  This deal allows us to close quickly and avoids further negotiation rounds."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $850000. This is still a great price for the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. While $850,000 is tempting, it's still above Bob's target price. It's worth seeing if Alice will budge further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still above my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $837,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal quickly. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 837500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $837500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $845000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $845,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $845,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has come down a little, but $845,000 is still too high for Bob.  It's time to cut his losses and buy from John, who is offering the product for $800,000, which fits within Bob's budget."
