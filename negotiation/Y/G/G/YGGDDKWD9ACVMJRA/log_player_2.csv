Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay under $80, but $75 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference - $85. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get a good deal.

Alice is unlikely to go below $85.  It's better to secure the $80 price from John now."
