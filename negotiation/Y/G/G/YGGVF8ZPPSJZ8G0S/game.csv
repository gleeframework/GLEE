"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I'd get elsewhere. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is still a good deal for you, and it gives me some breathing room on my side. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $11,000? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $11,500 as a final compromise. This price is still fair for both of us, and it's the best I can do. Let's make this happen!",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about $11,200?  That's my final offer, and I think it's a win-win for both of us.",11200.0,Bob,6,
