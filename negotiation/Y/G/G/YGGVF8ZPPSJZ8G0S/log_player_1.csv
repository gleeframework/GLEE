Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is still a good deal for you, and it gives me some breathing room on my side. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $11,000? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $11,500 as a final compromise. This price is still fair for both of us, and it's the best I can do. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about $11,200?  That's my final offer, and I think it's a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
While $11,200 is still lower than your minimum, it's only $800 less than your preferred price of $12,000. With only 4 rounds left, the risk of getting a lower offer from Bob or even needing to sell to John for less is a real possibility. Accepting this offer ensures you get a decent price and closes the deal quickly."
