"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I believe it's a good price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $9,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's not willing to reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $10,000.  Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of him walking away entirely. Accepting John's offer guarantees the minimum acceptable price for the product."
