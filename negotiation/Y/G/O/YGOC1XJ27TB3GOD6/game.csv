"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Can you meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $120 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I understand that $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $130. Can you consider that?,130.0,Bob,4,
