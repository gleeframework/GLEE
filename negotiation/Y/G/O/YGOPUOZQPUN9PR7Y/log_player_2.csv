"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my asking price. To start the conversation, I'd like to offer it to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  Bob has room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice. It's a great product, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your desire to find a good deal.  While I value your interest, the product's worth to you is undeniable, and $850,000 undervalues its potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer, potentially moving closer to a price that's beneficial for both parties.  It's worth exploring if there's further room for negotiation before considering buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. How about $875,000? That's a fair compromise, and it keeps us both happy."", ""product_price"": 875000}
