Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One Shot:** You only have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with John.

**Strategy**

The optimal strategy is to aim high but leave Bob with a perceived gain.  Here's a possible approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you're poised to gain."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,150,000 is closer to Bob's valuation, maximizing your potential profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" provides a reason for the price.
* **Perceived Gain:** Emphasizing Bob's ""significant return on investment"" makes the deal more enticing by focusing on his potential profit ($50,000). 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive, agreeable), you can tailor your message accordingly.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower price to foster goodwill.

**Remember:** This is just one possible offer.  Negotiation is dynamic, and observing Bob's reaction to your initial offer will guide your next steps."
