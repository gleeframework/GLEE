"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you offering me this product. However, $11000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending at the moment. Would you be willing to go down to $10500? That's my maximum budget for this product.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10800. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",10800.0,Alice,3,
