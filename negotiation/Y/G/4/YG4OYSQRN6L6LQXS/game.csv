"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I believe the product is worth your asking price, I can't quite meet that number. Would you be willing to accept $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,250. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and quality.",10000.0,Alice,5,
