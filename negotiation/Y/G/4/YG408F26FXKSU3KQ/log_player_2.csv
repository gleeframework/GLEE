You can likely get a better price than $80, so it's worth negotiating with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see how Alice reacts.  I'm aiming to get the price down as much as possible without losing the deal."

I'll reject Alice's offer again.  $75 is still more than I'd like to pay, and I have more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm serious about buying, but I'm still trying to get a lower price than $75."

$72 is a good price, and I'm getting close to my $100 limit for buying from John.  It's time to accept the deal."
