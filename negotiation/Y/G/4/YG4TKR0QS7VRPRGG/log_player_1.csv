"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's fair to both of us. I'm aiming for a good deal, but I also want to keep the negotiation going for now.  I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob if he's interested, but I'm also prepared to sell to John for $80 if Bob isn't willing to meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price to see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $110? This is a great deal for you and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 110}
