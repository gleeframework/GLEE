"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is my best offer and a fair reflection of its value.  Let me know what you think."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about we meet in the middle at $962,500? This is a fair offer considering your previous price and my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we are still giving up significant profit. We are in a strong position with John as a backup offer, so we can afford to negotiate a bit more firmly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground. I'm willing to be flexible, but $962,500 is still below what I can accept. To be fair to both of us, I'll come down to $1,025,000. This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're making smaller concessions now to signal that we're getting closer to our bottom line. We're aiming for a price above $1,000,000 while still keeping Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still quite interested in the product, but $1,025,000 is pushing my budget.  Could you meet me at $993,750? This splits the difference between our last two offers and feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $993,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $993,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are now getting very close to Bob's perceived value of the product ($1,000,000).  It's worth pushing a bit further to try and secure a price above that mark. We still have John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you've been persistent, and I respect that.  Let's close this deal.  I'm willing to come down to $1,012,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair price for a product of this quality and potential."",
""product_price"": 1012500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are now pushing a bit closer to Bob's offer, but making it clear this is our final move. This adds a bit of pressure on Bob to accept while still aiming for a price that's beneficial to us. By stating it's our final offer, we increase the chance of Bob accepting rather than risking the deal falling through."
