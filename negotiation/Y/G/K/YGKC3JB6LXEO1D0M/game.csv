"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. My asking price is $140, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  How about we bring it down to $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $130?  That gives us both a good deal.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Could you do $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $115 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $125? That's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
