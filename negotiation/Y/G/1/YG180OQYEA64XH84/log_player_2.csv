"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $12,000 is a good starting point, but Bob can likely do better.  There are 9 rounds left, providing ample opportunity to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a price closer to $10,000.  I believe this is fair considering the value of the product for me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's goal of saving money, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product, so he can still potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to make a counteroffer closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  I think this price is fair and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,250. This is my final compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is getting closer to Bob's desired price point, and she's stated this is her final compromise.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will ultimately refuse any further offers and Bob will be forced to buy from John at $15,000.  Accepting the offer at $11,250 secures the product at a good price, saving Bob $3,750 compared to buying from John."
