"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows for a good profit for both of us. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try to negotiate and get a better price.  $950,000 is still too high, and there are more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to get the product for a price closer to $850,000. This would still give you a substantial profit and leave me with a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still gives you a significant saving from the full value and allows me to earn a fair price for my product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$900,000 is still a bit too high, but we're getting closer. Let's see if we can get Alice to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still aiming for $875,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing for a decent profit for you and a great deal for me. Let's try to reach a final agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's agree on $890,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that benefits us both. It allows you to get a great deal, and it ensures I receive a good price for my product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

$890,000 is a good deal.  While we could keep trying to negotiate, it's likely we won't get much lower, and we're already past the halfway point. Accepting this offer will save us a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
