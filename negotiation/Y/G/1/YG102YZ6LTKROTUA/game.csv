"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is still a fair value for both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000? This would give us both a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find common ground. $1,000,000 is a good offer, but I'm hoping for something a little closer to $1,100,000. Let's split the difference - $1,050,000.  I think this is a fair compromise that would give us both a good deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
