Round 4

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $96 is still a bit high for me. I can offer $94. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $94
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob is consistently moving upwards in his offers, and we are getting close to the point where squeezing more might make him reconsider the whole deal.  Taking $94 is a good profit and avoids the risk of him walking away."
