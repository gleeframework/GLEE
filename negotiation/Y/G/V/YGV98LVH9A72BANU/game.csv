"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can we meet in the middle at $11,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a very fair price for a product of this quality.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm glad you're still interested.  To be honest, $9,250 is too far off from what I need to make this work. I can go as low as $11,500, but that's my absolute final offer.",11500.0,Alice,5,
