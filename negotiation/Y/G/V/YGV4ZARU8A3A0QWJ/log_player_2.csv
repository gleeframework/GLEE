"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I believe it's a great value considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still significantly more than your maximum budget and what John is offering. You can save a considerable amount of money ($400,000) by going with John."
