Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always a good idea to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely to get closer to your minimum price.
* **Close to Your Minimum:** While you want to aim high, you also don't want to scare Bob away with a price that's drastically higher than his perceived value. Offering it at $140 gives him a chance to counter-offer, but also ensures you get a good deal if he accepts.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so there's no pressure to go below your minimum."
