"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while ensuring I get a great deal.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is generous, the value this product brings warrants a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,850,000 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $1,600,000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
