"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for this product.  It's a fair price, considering my budget and the value of this product to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit, and $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above what I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a fair price, considering both our positions, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to close this deal.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me at $1,000,000. However, I'm still not willing to go that low, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,005,000. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",1005000.0,Alice,5,,
