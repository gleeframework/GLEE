"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good deal, it's still above his maximum budget of $1,000,000. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for this product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit, and $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's budget of $1,000,000. While it's closer to his target, Bob can still potentially negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue the negotiation process and potentially reach a more favorable price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above what I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a fair price, considering both our positions, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to close this deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me at $1,000,000. However, I'm still not willing to go that low, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,005,000. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,005,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,005,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,005,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While there's a chance Bob could potentially negotiate a lower price, there's also a risk that Alice won't budge further.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and avoids further negotiation risks."
