"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm ready to make a serious offer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential benefits this product offers.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is above your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This price still reflects the product's worth to you, while being more aligned with your budget.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on $900,000, which is still a substantial investment for me. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a significant investment for you, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This price is closer to my initial offer, but still takes into account your budget constraints.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to profit, but $1,050,000 is simply not within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is my final offer.  If it's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $950,000 is your final offer, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, which is $1,025,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a fair price for me.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
