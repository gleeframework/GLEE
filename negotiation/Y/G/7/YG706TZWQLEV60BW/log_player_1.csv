Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,500,000, Alice has a strong fallback position. This allows her to start negotiations with Bob at a price significantly higher than his perceived value ($800,000).
* **Targeting a Mutually Beneficial Outcome:** While aiming high, the offer of $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation. This price point could still be highly profitable for Alice while potentially enticing Bob with a price lower than what he might expect. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message is phrased to encourage dialogue. This gives Bob the opportunity to counter-offer, potentially revealing more about his willingness to pay. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has no pressing need to sell the product immediately. If she needs the money urgently, she might adjust her strategy to secure a faster sale."
