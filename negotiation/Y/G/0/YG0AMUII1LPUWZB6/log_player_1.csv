Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I think it's a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11999}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible without going below her minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below $12,000 allows room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and Alice might still secure a price above her guaranteed sale to John.
* **Create Urgency:** By offering a high price with a sense of urgency, Bob might be more inclined to accept before missing out on the opportunity. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing potential profit from Bob while ensuring Alice doesn't lose out on a guaranteed sale to John."
