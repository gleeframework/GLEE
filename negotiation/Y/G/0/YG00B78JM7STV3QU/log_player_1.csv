Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter with a price closer to his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm offering a price that is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I could continue negotiating with Bob, I've reached a point where his offers are getting too low for me. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
