"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $10000. It's a steal at this price! What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, I want to see if I can get it even lower. I'm going to counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $10,000 is a bit more than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
