You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower.  There's a chance to potentially save even more money by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer. This forces Alice to consider my seriousness in getting a lower price.  If she rejects it, we can then gauge how far she's willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but we can still push for a better price.  Rejecting this offer allows us to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to our initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're slowly increasing our offer, showing Alice we're serious about buying but still want a good deal.  This counteroffer is a compromise between our previous offer and Alice's latest offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally matched our counteroffer, which is a great price considering our initial target of $15,000. Accepting this offer ensures we get the product at a significant discount. Further negotiation might save a few more dollars, but it's not worth the risk of losing this deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
