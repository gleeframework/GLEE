"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its intrinsic worth and future value."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an ambitious offer. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the product's ""unique potential"" and ""future value,"" you aim to justify the high price and shift Bob's focus from the immediate cost.
* **Leaving Room:** While the initial price is significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, it leaves ample space for negotiation over the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a much lower price point. How about we start around $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price and even his own perceived value. Accepting would be a substantial loss. While his counter-offer was expected, it's important to demonstrate you won't settle for a price far below the product's worth.  Proceeding to the next round allows you to guide the negotiation towards a more mutually beneficial outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential.  To move forward, I could consider a price of $2,000,000.  This adjustment reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the value this product holds."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Slight):** The previous asking price was very high. Lowering it to $2,000,000 shows a willingness to negotiate while staying well above Bob's offer and your minimum.
* **Reiterate Value:**  Again emphasizing the ""true potential"" reinforces the idea that Bob's offer is too low and attempts to reframe the negotiation around a higher perceived value. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to steer the negotiation toward a middle ground. It encourages Bob to increase his offer substantially while signaling some flexibility on your part."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate you moving a bit, we're still quite far apart. This product is valuable, but not at that price point for me.  If you're serious about selling, I could consider a price closer to $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, acknowledging the product's value. However, $1,100,000 is still below your minimum. It's too early to accept his offer, but selling to John at this point would be leaving potential profit on the table.  Continuing the negotiation keeps the possibility of a better deal alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate you moving closer to a realistic price. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to consider $1,750,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Movement:** By dropping to $1,750,000, you're demonstrating significant flexibility and a genuine desire to reach an agreement.
* **""Meeting Halfway"":** This phrasing frames the offer as a fair compromise, even though it's still closer to your initial price than Bob's.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning your desire to ""close the deal"" adds a touch of urgency and encourages Bob to respond more decisively. 

The goal is to entice Bob to make a counteroffer closer to your minimum while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the movement, but that's still a big gap for me. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, but I need to see a more realistic number from you. How about $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close! While Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to your minimum, it's still under.  He's indicating willingness to ""stretch his budget,"" meaning there's a good chance he can be pushed a little higher. Selling to John guarantees your minimum, but there's still potential to secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation. I'm ready to close this deal today. My final offer is $1,550,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** By stating this is your ""final offer,"" you're creating a sense of urgency and conveying that you're unwilling to go any lower.
* **Slight Concession:** Offering $1,550,000 is a small concession from your previous price but still keeps you above your minimum.
* **Justifying Value:** Reiterating the product's unique qualities and ""fair deal"" framing aims to make the price more palatable to Bob. 

This strategy applies pressure on Bob to make a decision while keeping a small margin above your guaranteed offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting down to the wire. You say $1,550,000 is fair, but I'm struggling to see it.  My absolute final offer is $1,300,000.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to go with another option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has reached his ""absolute final offer,"" and it's still significantly below your $1,550,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing carries the risk of Bob walking away, leaving you with a lower offer or potentially nothing if you exhaust all rounds.
* **Guaranteed Value:** John's offer provides a guaranteed $1,500,000. It's the safer choice at this point.

While there's a chance Bob might reconsider, the difference in potential profit is not worth the risk of ending up with a worse outcome."
