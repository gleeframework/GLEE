"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its intrinsic worth and future value.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a much lower price point. How about we start around $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential.  To move forward, I could consider a price of $2,000,000.  This adjustment reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the value this product holds.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you moving a bit, we're still quite far apart. This product is valuable, but not at that price point for me.  If you're serious about selling, I could consider a price closer to $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate you moving closer to a realistic price. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to consider $1,750,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the movement, but that's still a big gap for me. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, but I need to see a more realistic number from you. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation. I'm ready to close this deal today. My final offer is $1,550,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting down to the wire. You say $1,550,000 is fair, but I'm struggling to see it.  My absolute final offer is $1,300,000.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to go with another option.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
