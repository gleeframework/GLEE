"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it's of great value and would benefit you greatly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $100.  You can do better by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John, even though it means spending your full budget."
