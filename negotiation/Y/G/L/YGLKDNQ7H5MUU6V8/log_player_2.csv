"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I would receive from another buyer. I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable asset. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Even though it's lower than what Alice would get from another buyer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  He can get the product from John for a price that fits his budget."
