# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really love.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $95.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no need to pay $95."
