Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a discounted price of $11,500. This is a fantastic deal for an item of this quality. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, I want to see if I can get closer to the product's true value to me. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** $11,500 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still offers him a saving of $500. 
* **Urgency (Implied):**  The message doesn't explicitly mention John, but the discounted price and ""let me know what you think"" subtly imply this might be Bob's best chance. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
