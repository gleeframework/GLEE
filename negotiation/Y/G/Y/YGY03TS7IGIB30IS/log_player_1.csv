Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is higher than my minimum, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $100 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to reach a deal at a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still better than selling to John.  I'm willing to take the lower price to avoid further negotiations."
