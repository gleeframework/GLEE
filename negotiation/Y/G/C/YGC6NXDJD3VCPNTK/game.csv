"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I can't commit to $10000. How about we aim for a price closer to $8000 which is closer to its value to me?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $9000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I believe $9000 is still beyond my budget. Could we aim for $8500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's meet in the middle.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but $8500 is still too low for me.  How about we settle on $9250?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the outcome.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8750 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $9000 to close this deal.  It's a fair compromise, and it's the best offer you'll get from me.",9000.0,Alice,7,
