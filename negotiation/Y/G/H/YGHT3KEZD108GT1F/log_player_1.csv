Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Anchor:** By starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($18,000 vs. $12,000), Alice anchors the negotiation higher.  This leaves room for potential negotiation while aiming for a price closer to her desired outcome.
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Mentioning that she's offering it to Bob before a public listing creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially making the offer more appealing. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, the message implies a willingness to discuss the price (""What do you think?""). This allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:** It's unclear how price-sensitive Bob is. A very high offer might make him disengage entirely.
* **Alice's Time Sensitivity:** If Alice needs to sell the product quickly, a slightly lower initial offer might be more strategic. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit.  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John."
