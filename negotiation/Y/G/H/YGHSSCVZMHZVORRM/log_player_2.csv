"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I think it could be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now. How about $12,000?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but I'm looking for something closer to my original price. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $13,000:** This is closer to Bob's ideal price point than John's offer of $15,000. 
* **Negotiating further may be risky:**  There's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and Bob could end up paying John's price.

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob saves $2,000 compared to John's price and achieves a good compromise."
