"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $9,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $10,500 is still above my budget.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal. ",9000.0,Bob,6,
