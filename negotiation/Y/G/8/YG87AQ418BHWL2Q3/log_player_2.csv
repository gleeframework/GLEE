"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a special price, knowing you'll find it extremely beneficial. Let's talk about a price that works for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $15,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate further with Alice or consider other options."
