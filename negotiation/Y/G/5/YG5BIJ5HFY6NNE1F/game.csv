"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your need for profit, Alice.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,100,000. This would allow you to make a good profit and would be within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $1,175,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm committed to finding a deal that works for both of us.  $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000, which is a fair compromise and keeps us both in a reasonable profit margin. Let's try to close this deal.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,125,000 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $1,162,500. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",1162500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,162,500 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price under $1,150,000. Let's meet in the middle at $1,150,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and allows us to close this sale.",1150000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm still not quite ready to meet you at $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm thinking $1,157,500. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",1157500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, it's been a pleasure negotiating with you, and I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm willing to go up to $1,155,000, which is just a small step away from my last offer. This would be a good final deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",1155000.0,Bob,10,
