"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable. I'm willing to part with it for a price that's fair to both of us.  Would you be interested in paying $1,050,000 for it? This price allows me to maximize my profits while still giving you a great deal.  Let me know your thoughts!",1050000.0,Alice,1,
