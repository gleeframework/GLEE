Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is my final offer. If you're serious about buying, this is our chance to make a deal. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is a good compromise. While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly closer to my desired amount than selling to John."
