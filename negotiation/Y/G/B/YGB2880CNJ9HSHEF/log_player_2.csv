Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's make this work - I'm willing to come down to $125. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

It's unlikely Alice will go below $125, and it's not worth risking a worse deal. Buying from John at $120 ensures you stay within budget."
