{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation.  This allows for a possible counteroffer from Bob, giving me the chance to either accept a lower price or continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $120 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $120 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum.  This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell at his price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $130 for the product. I hope this will be acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm willing to negotiate,  I'm not willing to go that low.  I'm going to sell to John for $150, which is a better deal for me."
