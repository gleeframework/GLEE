"Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $175 is way above your maximum budget of $100.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price or simply buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering the maximum price I'm willing to pay, which is $100. This is the price I could get from John, so it's a fair starting point for negotiation. Hopefully, Alice will accept this price, but if not, I can always go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is within my budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $100.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down any more, and I risk losing the product to another buyer. It's better to accept this offer and secure the product."
