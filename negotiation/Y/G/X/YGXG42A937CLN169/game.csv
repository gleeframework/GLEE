"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I can get from it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $1000000 is a fair offer, it's not quite at the level I need to make this transaction worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the value you'll gain from owning this product.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, but $1250000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
