"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in this product, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we compromise at $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go back to $13,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $13,750?",13750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your target price, but $13,750 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $13,500? This price is fair for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,6,
