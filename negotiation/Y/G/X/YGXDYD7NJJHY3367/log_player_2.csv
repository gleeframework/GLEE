# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,250.

Round 7

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $10,000.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially losing the guaranteed $10,000 offer from John."
