# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,250 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to go a bit higher and offer it to you for $10,800. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think!

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price rather than risk Alice sticking to her ""final offer"" and missing out."
