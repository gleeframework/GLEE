Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth at least $120 to me.  I'm willing to let it go for $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $100, so this gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum price of $120.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can adjust the price if Bob makes a counteroffer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'd prefer to sell to John for $120, I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still trying to get closer to my minimum price.
* **Motivational message:**  The message is friendly and reinforces that I want to reach an agreement.
* **Room for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I can further lower my price in subsequent rounds."
