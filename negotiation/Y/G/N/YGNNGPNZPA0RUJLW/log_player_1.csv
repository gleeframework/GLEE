Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This leaves room for negotiation, as Bob values the product at $15,000. I'm also keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, leaving a decent margin for profit."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

I'm offering a counteroffer of $13,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for him to accept, but still allows me to earn a decent profit."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  With only 4 rounds left, it's getting risky to continue negotiating. This price is slightly above my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
