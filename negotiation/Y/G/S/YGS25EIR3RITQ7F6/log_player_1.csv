"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely to be rejected.  This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's serious about buying.  It also leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my desired outcome.  I believe this offer is reasonable and might be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my target price. While I'd prefer a bit more,  accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
