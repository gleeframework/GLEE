Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $20,000. I believe it will be incredibly valuable for you, and this is a very competitive price."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer matches John's offer, and further negotiation might not yield a better outcome, it's best to accept.
