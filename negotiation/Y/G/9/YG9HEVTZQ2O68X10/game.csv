"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1125000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to see some more movement from you. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1180000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
