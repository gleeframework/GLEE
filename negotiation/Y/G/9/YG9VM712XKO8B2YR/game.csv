"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good deal, but $950000 is still a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to meet my minimum requirements. I'm now offering the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but $980000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1020000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here. What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go any lower than $1020000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a complimentary maintenance package, which is valued at $20000. I'm confident that this will make the product even more attractive to you. I'm still offering the product to you for $1020000, but I think the extras will make it a more compelling offer. What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not willing to pay $1020000. I'm willing to make one final offer of $980000. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",980000.0,Bob,10,
