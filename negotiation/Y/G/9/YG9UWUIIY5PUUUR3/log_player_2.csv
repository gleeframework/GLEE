Alice's offer is close to my maximum but there's still room for negotiation to save some money.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $140 feels a bit high for me.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below my $150 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we agree on $125 for the product?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but I think I can still get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer a bit closer to her price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows Alice I'm willing to move closer to her price, but I'm still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering our previous discussions, I believe $120 would be a fair price for both of us. I hope you're willing to meet halfway, Bob. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has met her own valuation of the product. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and this price is a good deal for me.  I'll accept the offer."
