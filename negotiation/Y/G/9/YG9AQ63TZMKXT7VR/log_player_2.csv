Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair price. How about we aim for a price between $90 and $110? I'm open to negotiation. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer is already at your maximum price point. There's no benefit to negotiating further or buying from John."
