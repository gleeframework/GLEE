(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. $850,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see how flexible Alice is.  $700,000 is still a good deal for me, but it gives Alice room to bargain while still leaving me a substantial savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$750,000 is still a good deal, but I can likely get closer to my target price.  I'll see if I can push Alice a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 725000}
```

I'm going to try a smaller increment this time, testing the waters to see if Alice is willing to budge a little more. $725,000 is still a significant savings for me and a good starting point for a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $735,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $735,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my desired price. $735,000 is a good deal for me, and I'm starting to run out of rounds. It's time to lock in this price before the opportunity to buy from John becomes more tempting."
