"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $180 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. What do you say?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $140 is a bit low for me. I can do $160, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $155? I'm really interested in this product and I think we can find a middle ground.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, so I'll meet you there. I'll sell it to you for $157.50. What do you think?",157.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm very close to your price, but I'm still hoping to get it for $155. I really want this product, but I can't go any higher than that.",155.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $157.50, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",157.5,Alice,7,
