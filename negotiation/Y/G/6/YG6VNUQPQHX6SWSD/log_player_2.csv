Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $10,000. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $10,500. Accepting this offer represents a good deal compared to John's $15,000 price."
