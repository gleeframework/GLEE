"I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price?",8500.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,11000.0
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $11,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,500? That's a fair bit closer to my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,10500.0
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $9,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, which is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,,

"Okay, Alice, it seems like we're getting close. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000 even? ",10000.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,10500.0
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $10,000. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,7,,
