"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your position, the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This offer represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,200,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we settle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a pattern here of back-and-forth that might be wasting both our time.  I want to be fair, but $1,100,000 is really pushing the limit of what I can accept. My final offer is $1,175,000.  This reflects the true value of the product. Let me know if you're serious, or I need to explore other options.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,137,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",1137500.0,Bob,6,
