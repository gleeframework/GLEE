Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing a pattern here of back-and-forth that might be wasting both our time.  I want to be fair, but $1,100,000 is really pushing the limit of what I can accept.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is consistently moving towards a middle ground. Accepting his offer at $1,137,500 ensures a significant profit over my minimum and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether by pushing too hard."
