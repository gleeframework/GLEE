# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $13,000. I know it's valuable to you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
