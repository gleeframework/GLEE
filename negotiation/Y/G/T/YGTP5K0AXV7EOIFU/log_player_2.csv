"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $17,000 is above Bob's maximum price of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. While buying from John for $15,000 is a guaranteed option, Bob should try to negotiate a better price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $17,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Considering my budget and the value of the product to me, I'd like to offer $14,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I'm happy to negotiate, I can't go lower than $16,000. This product is unique and holds significant value. How about we split the difference? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above Bob's maximum price of $15,000.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to lower the price further. While buying from John for $15,000 is a safe option, there's still room for negotiation with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counter-offer and see if he can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still slightly above my budget.  How about we compromise at $15,500? It's a fair price considering the value to me and your need to sell. Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 15500}
