"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $17,000 is higher than your minimum of $15,000.
* **It's not too high:**  It leaves room for negotiation and doesn't immediately turn Bob off. 
* **It includes a reason:**  Giving a reason for the price helps justify it to Bob.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $17,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Considering my budget and the value of the product to me, I'd like to offer $14,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:**  $14,000 is less than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** You have 8 more rounds, so there's time to find a middle ground.
* **Selling to John is a safe option:**  It guarantees you your minimum, but it also means you miss out on the potential for a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

In round 3, you'll need to send Bob a counteroffer that's higher than $14,000 but lower than $17,000. You want to see if you can find a price that's acceptable to both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm happy to negotiate, I can't go lower than $16,000. This product is unique and holds significant value. How about we split the difference?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a midpoint between your initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterate Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's unique value, justifying the slightly higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The ""split the difference"" suggestion implies flexibility and encourages further discussion.

This approach aims to keep Bob engaged while maintaining a price that's still above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still slightly above my budget.  How about we compromise at $15,500? It's a fair price considering the value to me and your need to sell. Let's get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Your Minimum:** Bob's offer of $15,500 is only $500 below your minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  The negotiations have progressed, and Bob has shown a willingness to compromise.
* **Risk of Losing a Deal:** Rejecting this offer could lead to further rounds of negotiation, which might ultimately result in a lower price or a failed deal. 

**This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and securing a sale.** Selling to John would only net you $15,000, while accepting Bob's offer guarantees $15,500, which is a better outcome."
