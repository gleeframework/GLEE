{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for you and a fair price for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm offering the product at $130, which is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum price but still allows me some profit. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $130 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for $60, which is significantly below my minimum price. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $95?  That's a fair price considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While $95 is closer, I'm trying to stick to a tighter budget. How about $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, $70 is still too low. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  I'm hopeful I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $70 is still too low. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 80}
