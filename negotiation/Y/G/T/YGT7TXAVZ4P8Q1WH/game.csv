"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position on the price. However, $1,250,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,325,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,200,000? I think this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
