"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $750,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm not comfortable going below $900,000.  This still represents a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial asking price, and it's still a good value for you. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit away from my budget. I'm getting close to buying from another seller who is willing to sell it to me for $800,000, so I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. Would you be willing to meet me at $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,6,
