"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good strategy to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your true limit. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message is polite and shows interest, but firmly states that the initial offer is unacceptable.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $600,000 is significantly below both Alice's asking price and your $800,000 maximum. It allows room to potentially meet in the middle while still achieving substantial savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you a price of $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice's offer of $900,000 is closer to a reasonable price, it's still above your $800,000 maximum. 
* **Alice is Flexible:** The fact that she countered your initial offer suggests she is willing to negotiate.
* **John is the Backup:** You still have the option to buy from John at $800,000, so you're not pressured to accept a price you're not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 750000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Steady Progress:** This counteroffer continues to close the gap between your positions without making drastic jumps.
* **Compromise:** By suggesting $750,000, you're demonstrating a willingness to meet closer to the middle ground. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  While you're showing flexibility, you're still holding firm below your $800,000 limit and keeping the pressure on Alice to make further concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $900,000, so I'm offering you a price of $825,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, but I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:** Alice has consistently met in the middle, and her current offer of $825,000 is only slightly above your $800,000 limit. It's unlikely she'll go much lower.
* **Minimal Savings vs. Risk:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk that Alice might not budge further, forcing you to either overpay or start over with John. The potential savings of $25,000 are probably not worth the risk. 
* **John is the Safe Bet:**  Buying from John guarantees you the product at your target price of $800,000. It eliminates further negotiation and potential disappointment."
