"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you a price of $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $900,000, so I'm offering you a price of $825,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, but I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",825000.0,Alice,5,
