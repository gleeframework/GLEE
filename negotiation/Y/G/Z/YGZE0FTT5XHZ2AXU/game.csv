"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the potential return on investment. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be confident that I'm getting a good deal.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and coming back with a proposal. While $1,500,000 is a respectable figure, it doesn't fully reflect the unique value proposition this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $1,750,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be confident that I'm getting a good deal. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and the potential return on investment.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a strong return on your investment, but your current offer significantly undervalues what this product brings to the table. I've been transparent about my position, and I need you to understand that $1,650,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair and final offer considering the value you'll gain.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I still believe that $1,650,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be more confident in the deal. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and the potential return on investment. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price, but I'm still interested in making a deal.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
