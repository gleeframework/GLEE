{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum of $8,000, but still leaves a significant profit margin for Bob. It also leaves room for negotiation if he counters.  I'm confident that I can get a higher price than $8,000 from John if needed, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is more than my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a higher price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? I'm confident this is a fair price that gives you a good deal while also allowing me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about we try $9,750? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,750 is close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing this deal.  It's worth taking this price, as it's likely I won't get a better offer from him.  While I could try for a higher price, it's not worth the risk of losing the sale entirely."
