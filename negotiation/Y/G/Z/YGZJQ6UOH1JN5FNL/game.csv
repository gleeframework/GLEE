"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? I'm confident this is a fair price that gives you a good deal while also allowing me to make a reasonable profit.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about we try $9,750? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
