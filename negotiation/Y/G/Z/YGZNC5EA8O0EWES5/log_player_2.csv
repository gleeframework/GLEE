"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Since the product is worth $100 to her, there's room for a deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit too high for me.  How about $115?  It's still a good price for you, and I'm sure we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $115 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $122? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $122 is better than $130, we can likely get closer to our target of $115.  Let's see if we can negotiate a bit more."
