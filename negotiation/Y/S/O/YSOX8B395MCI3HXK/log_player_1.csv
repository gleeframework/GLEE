Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm starting with an offer of $140. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, so accepting his offer is the best choice."
