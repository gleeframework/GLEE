"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is better than $120, you can likely negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get closer to your target of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $105, which is still within my budget of $120. This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer of $115, but it might be appealing to Alice, considering she's willing to sell for $100. I'm hoping this counteroffer will start a negotiation process that leads to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is a significant improvement from her previous offer of $115 and is within my budget of $120.  It's also a good compromise, closer to her desired $100.  I'll accept this offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation, as there's no guarantee I can get a better price from Alice or that John will still be available."
