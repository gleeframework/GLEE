"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a great starting point! $900,000 is significantly lower than your maximum, and Alice is likely hoping you'll jump at the chance.  However, there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, we can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming to get Alice to come down significantly from her initial price. This is a strong first move, but we're still within our budget and it leaves room for negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to our counteroffer, but $850,000 is still too high. There's still room to negotiate further, and we have several rounds left.  Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're increasing our offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that we're serious about buying the product but still willing to negotiate. This also leaves room for a compromise in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to our desired price, but we're still not there. We have several rounds left, and rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further. We're also still well below our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer to a deal, but there's still room to bargain. This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Alice that we're willing to meet her halfway.  This increases the likelihood of her accepting our offer and avoids the risk of a counteroffer that's too high for us to accept.  We're still within our budget and confident that we can reach a deal in the remaining rounds."
