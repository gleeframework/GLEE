"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,200,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This reflects the product's unique capabilities and its potential to benefit your business.  I believe it's a fair price considering the mutual benefit we can achieve.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but  $1,550,000 is still a bit high. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,375,000?  That seems like a reasonable compromise.",1375000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price point, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,375,000 is still below the value I'm seeking.  To show my commitment to a successful deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This price is a fair compromise, considering the product's unique capabilities and the potential benefits it offers. I believe this is a win-win for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very accommodating, and I respect your position. While  $1,450,000 is getting close, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. My final offer is $1,400,000.  If you can't do that, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
