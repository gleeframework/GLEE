"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1200000 to me, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price that allows me to get a good return while also giving you a great opportunity. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
