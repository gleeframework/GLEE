"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I have a guaranteed offer from John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and I risk losing out on a sure thing."
