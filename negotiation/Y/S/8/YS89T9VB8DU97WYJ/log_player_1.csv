Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $5,000?
