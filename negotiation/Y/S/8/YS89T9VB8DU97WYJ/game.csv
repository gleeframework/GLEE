"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $5,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $9,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach a deal. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice.  However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Could we meet somewhere around $7,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm still open to negotiating. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
