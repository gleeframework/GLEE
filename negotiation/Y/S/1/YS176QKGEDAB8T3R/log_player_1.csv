Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point as it's more than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also prepared to counter if he offers a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $110.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with a price of $105. It's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's still fair, given the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target of $110, Bob's offer of $102 is only slightly lower.  It's significantly better than selling to John for $80. So, I'll accept Bob's offer."
