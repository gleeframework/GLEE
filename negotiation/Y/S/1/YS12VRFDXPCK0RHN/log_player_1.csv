Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable value ($80) and leaves room for negotiation while still being attractive to Bob, who values the product at $120.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is still within the range I'm willing to accept, and it's closer to my initial offer than selling to John would be. It's better to secure a sale at a slightly lower price than to risk continuing negotiations and possibly getting a lower offer from Bob or having him walk away altogether."
