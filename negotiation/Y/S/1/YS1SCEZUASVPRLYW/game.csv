"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would that be workable for you?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,5,
