Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I know you're interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $14,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity to get what you want at a price below its true value."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While I could start at $15,000, a slightly lower offer might make Bob feel he's getting a better deal and be more likely to accept immediately.
* **Secure a Sale:** Offering a price significantly lower (closer to John's $12,000 offer) leaves too much potential profit on the table.

This offer balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
