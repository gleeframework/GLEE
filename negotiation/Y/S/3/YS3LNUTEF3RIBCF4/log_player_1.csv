Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe holds significant value. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. It's a competitive price considering the potential of this product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product seems interesting, but $1500000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I'm not willing to sell for less. It's still early in the negotiation, and there's a chance Bob might increase his offer.  I'll try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 doesn't reflect the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still allows for a good profit for me while giving you a chance to acquire a valuable asset. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe in the potential of your product, but $1250000 is still beyond what I can comfortably invest. My final offer is $1100000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm not ready to settle for a lower offer just yet. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,100,000 still undervalues the product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that ensures both of us benefit from this deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1150000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1100000.  This price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident this product has the potential to be very valuable.  Let's reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob seems firm on his offer, and it's unlikely he'll budge much further. Although I'm still hopeful for a better price, it's getting riskier to keep negotiating with only a few rounds left.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a decent profit and avoids the potential for losing out entirely."
