"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe holds significant value. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. It's a competitive price considering the potential of this product. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $1500000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 doesn't reflect the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This price still allows for a good profit for me while giving you a chance to acquire a valuable asset. Let's work together to find a solution.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe in the potential of your product, but $1250000 is still beyond what I can comfortably invest. My final offer is $1100000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1100000 still undervalues the product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1150000. This is a fair compromise that ensures both of us benefit from this deal.  Let's make this happen.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1150000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1100000.  This price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident this product has the potential to be very valuable.  Let's reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
