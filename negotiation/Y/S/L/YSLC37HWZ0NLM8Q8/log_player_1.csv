Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity for you to significantly increase your [mention specific benefit Bob would get from the product]. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $750,000 for the product. Let me know if this is within your considerations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. $750,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $750,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial price. I'm happy to offer it to you for $900,000. This price still allows you to make a good profit, while also being fair for me. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I still believe we can reach an agreement within my budget. I am willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $850,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price and is a good deal for Bob. It's risky to keep going with the negotiation, as there's no guarantee we'll reach a better price and I might end up selling to John for the same amount."
