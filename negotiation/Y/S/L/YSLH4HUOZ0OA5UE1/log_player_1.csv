"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm framing the price as a ""great deal"" to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $120 is a bit too steep for me right now.  How about we split the difference and I pay $100?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$100 is still too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price.
* **More negotiation room:** Rejecting allows me to control the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price.
* **Time to counter:** I can use the next round to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $100 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price but still staying above my minimum.
* **Reiterate value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize why $110 is fair.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm encouraging Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
