"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $10,000.  There's no reason to accept it.  You should counter-offer and see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is significantly over my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my maximum value for this product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10000. However, I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $14000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further. You're still in early rounds, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise. You can likely get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $10,000. It's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and while she's made concessions, the price remains too high.  You've already rejected her previous offer, so continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome.  It's better to secure the product from John at your maximum price point to avoid the risk of a prolonged negotiation."
