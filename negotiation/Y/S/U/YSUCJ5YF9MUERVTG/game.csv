"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is a good middle ground, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit. $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $11,000?  That seems like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
