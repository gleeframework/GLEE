Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm very serious about buying this product, but I can't go any higher than $13,000.  Let's try to reach a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to make a profit, and $13,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $17,000, which is a significant discount from my original price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice keeps dropping the price, but she's still too high for Bob's budget. John provides a safe and affordable option, so Bob should take it."
