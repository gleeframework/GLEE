Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as much money as possible, and offering it slightly below its value to Bob ($11,500) might entice him to buy. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a strong initial offer, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, although Alice shouldn't go below $12,000.
* **Time Value:** Even though John offers $12,000, closing the deal with Bob quickly might be preferable to waiting."
