Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you're in a strong position. Starting high allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:**  While the price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, the message emphasizes the ""true value and potential."" This framing aims to justify the high price and potentially persuade Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The message encourages a response from Bob, opening the door for negotiation. He might counter-offer, giving you further insight into his willingness to pay.

**Important Note:** This is a bold strategy. Bob might reject the offer outright. However, the potential for a much higher profit justifies the risk, especially with John as a safety net."
