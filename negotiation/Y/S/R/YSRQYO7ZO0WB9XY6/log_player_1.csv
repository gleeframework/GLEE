{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is attempting to compromise, we're still significantly above John's offer.  We're getting closer, and there's a chance Bob might be willing to go slightly above his comfort zone to close the deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  How about we land at $765,000? This is a significant reduction on my end, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 765000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Conveying Flexibility and Seriousness:** The message aims to show Bob that we are willing to be flexible and want to close the deal.
* **Justification:** By highlighting it as a ""significant reduction,"" we emphasize our movement towards his offer.
* **Closing Tone:**  Phrasing like ""finalize the deal"" implies a sense of urgency and desire to reach an agreement."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting really close. I can offer you $758,000. Let's get this deal done!

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $758,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now in a delicate stage of the negotiation. Bob is clearly signaling he's near his maximum price. However, we're still close enough to John's offer that it makes sense to push slightly further.  There's a risk Bob might walk away, but there's also a chance he'll meet us at our desired price point."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're really close.  I'm willing to come down to $760,000, but I can't go any lower than that.  This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 760000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** By stating this is our ""final offer,"" we create a sense of urgency and signal that this is our bottom line. 
* **Small Concession:** Coming down by $5,000 shows a willingness to negotiate, but emphasizes that the price is firm.
* **Targeting a Sweet Spot:**  This price is slightly above Bob's last offer but still below John's offer, aiming to secure the best possible deal."
