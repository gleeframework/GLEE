"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer you $750,000 for it.  This is a fair price, given the value you placed on it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the product's true value. Considering your offer of $750,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you've placed on it. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is a fair price considering your own valuation of the product. This is my final offer.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
