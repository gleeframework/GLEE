Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $10,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you."", ""product_price"": 10000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will meet or exceed that price.
* **Strong Starting Point:**  Starting at your desired price provides a basis for negotiation. Bob may be willing to pay the full amount, especially if you highlight the product's benefits.
* **No Room for Lowballing:** By starting at $10,000, you discourage Bob from countering with an offer far below your minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you don't mind the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. If you highly prioritize a quick sale to Bob, you could consider a slightly lower initial price, but it would increase the risk of earning less than John's offer."
