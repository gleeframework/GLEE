"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($80) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly approach:** I'm using a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A $100 offer gives me some space to negotiate down if Bob rejects it.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds. If he rejects my offer, I'll need to decide if I want to lower my price or try to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:**  Bob's counteroffer of $90 is still above my minimum price of $120, so there's potential to secure a better deal.
* **Limited rounds:** With only 10 rounds, I can't afford to settle too quickly. I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my desired $120.
* **John's offer as safety net:**  I have John's offer of $120 as a fallback option, so I'm not pressured to accept a price I'm not happy with. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than his counteroffer. I'll try to find a middle ground that's appealing to him while still being profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 is the lowest I can go right now. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** I'm proposing a price in between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but am still aiming for a profitable price.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to keep the conversation amicable.
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation, as the price is still above Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely watch Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll need to reassess my strategy.  If he accepts, great! If not, I'll consider lowering my price further or perhaps offering a bonus to sweeten the deal. I'm also mindful of the limited rounds remaining and John's offer as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is still above my minimum price of $120, so I'm not desperate to accept it. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can push for a higher price.
* **Limited Rounds:** While I'm aware of the limited rounds, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my ideal. 
* **John's Safety Net:** I have John's offer as a backup, which gives me confidence to continue negotiating. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer of $95. I'll aim to find a compromise that both parties can agree on. I'll also consider adding a sweetener to my offer, such as free shipping or a small discount on a future purchase, to entice Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I can't go as low as $85. Let's try to find a happy middle ground. Would you be willing to consider $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise between my previous offer ($95) and Bob's latest offer ($85). 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""happy middle ground"" and ""fair price"" to make the offer more appealing to Bob.
* **Confidence:** I'm expressing confidence in the product's value to reinforce the offer's legitimacy. 
* **Limited Rounds:** I'm still considering the limited rounds, but I'm not willing to settle too low yet.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response. If he accepts, excellent! If not, I'll need to decide if I want to lower my price further or explore other options, such as offering a bonus or even considering John's offer. However, I'm still optimistic that we can reach an agreement before the rounds run out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $90. Can you consider $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $87.5 is still below my desired price, it's very close to my minimum of $120. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only four rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is increasing.  
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $120 is tempting, it's important to consider the potential for Bob to counteroffer again. If he lowers his offer in Round 7, I might regret not accepting his current offer.

**Next Steps:**

While I'm accepting Bob's offer, I'll keep John's offer in mind for future negotiations if needed. I'll also be mindful of my minimum price and won't be afraid to reject any future counteroffers that fall too far below $87.5."
