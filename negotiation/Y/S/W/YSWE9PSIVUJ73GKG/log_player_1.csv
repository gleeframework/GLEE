Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting high, but still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation but shows I'm serious about getting a good price. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and direct, highlighting the potential value for Bob. This encourages him to consider the offer. 
* **Strategy:** I'm testing the waters to see how Bob reacts. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer again. But if he accepts, I've secured a good deal.  

Remember, I'm always prepared to go to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While $1,000,000 is still more than the product's worth to him, it's a huge loss for me. I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get a better price. I'm confident I can secure a better offer than $1,000,000. 

I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,500,000 if Bob refuses to come closer to my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,200,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm counter-offering at $1,200,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still ensuring I get a decent price.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone and emphasizing the value proposition for Bob. I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by highlighting the possibility of a deal.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal. If Bob still refuses, I'll have to reconsider my options, including selling to John.  

I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm also willing to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $950,000? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Even though I'm willing to negotiate, this offer is simply too low.  I've made several compromises already and I don't see a way to get closer to my goal with Bob.

I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000, as this ensures I get the best possible price and meet my minimum requirement.  While it's a shame to miss out on a potential sale with Bob, I need to prioritize my own financial goals."
