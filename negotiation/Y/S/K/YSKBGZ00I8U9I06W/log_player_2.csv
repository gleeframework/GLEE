"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. It makes no sense to accept it.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $2,000,000 is far above my budget.  I'm interested in the product but I can only go as high as $1,200,000 right now.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However,  $2,000,000 represents a significant discount from the true value of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This price reflects the unique benefits and potential this product offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $2,000,000, it's still above Bob's budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $1,200,000. This is the absolute maximum I can pay.  If we can't find a middle ground here, I'll need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need you to meet me halfway here.  This product is a worthwhile investment, and I'm confident it will pay off for you. To demonstrate my commitment to making this deal work, I'm proposing a final offer of $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price given the value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still higher than Bob's budget of $1,200,000.  However, it's getting closer.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer again, potentially pushing Alice closer to his desired price.  There's still time to negotiate before needing to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can reach an agreement. If not, I'll have to seriously consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
