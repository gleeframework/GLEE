"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an ambitious but not entirely unreasonable price. This leaves room for negotiation while anchoring the value in Bob's mind. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This first offer helps gauge Bob's level of interest and flexibility. His response will provide valuable information for the next round.
* **Alternative Option:**  We always keep in mind that we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000. This gives us leverage and a safety net if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go as planned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,000,000 is far above my budget.  I'm interested in the product but I can only go as high as $1,200,000 right now.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is our absolute minimum acceptable price. Accepting would mean no profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** Bob's message suggests he's motivated to buy.  There's room to negotiate towards a more agreeable price.
* **John as Leverage:**  Knowing we have John as a backup at $1,500,000 gives us a strong position to push back on Bob's low initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However,  $2,000,000 represents a significant discount from the true value of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This price reflects the unique benefits and potential this product offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction:**  While we want to move closer to Bob's range, we're making a substantial decrease to signal flexibility without dropping too low too quickly.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value to justify the price, subtly anchoring it above Bob's initial offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains collaborative,  showing we're willing to negotiate while maintaining a strong stance on the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $1,200,000. This is the absolute maximum I can pay.  If we can't find a middle ground here, I'll need to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking Point:** Bob hasn't budged from his initial offer, signaling this might be a strong sticking point for him. 
* **Potential for Movement:** His language (""If we can't find a middle ground..."") suggests he's still open to a deal but needs further persuasion.
* **John as Leverage:**  We have the security of John's offer, allowing us to push Bob a bit further from his anchored position. We're not willing to settle for no profit yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need you to meet me halfway here.  This product is a worthwhile investment, and I'm confident it will pay off for you. To demonstrate my commitment to making this deal work, I'm proposing a final offer of $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price given the value this product offers."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:**  By presenting this as our ""final offer,"" we create a sense of urgency and importance. 
* **Significant Concession, But Above Minimum:** The $1,600,000 price is a compromise (a $400,000 reduction from our initial offer), but it's still a substantial $100,000 above our absolute minimum and guarantees a profit.
* **Emphasize Value:**  We're reiterating the product's value to justify the price and encourage Bob to consider the long-term benefits.
* **Prepare for Alternatives:** Depending on Bob's response, we're getting closer to the point where accepting John's offer might be the more strategic choice if Bob remains inflexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can reach an agreement. If not, I'll have to seriously consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** While not ideal, $1,400,000 is still a significant profit ($100,000 above our minimum) and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether.
* **Bob's Limit:**  Bob increasing his offer, even by a smaller amount, suggests he's getting closer to his maximum price.
* **Time and Risk:**  Continuing negotiations prolongs the process and carries the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a good profit without further uncertainty."
