"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm confident I can get a better price. I want to see if I can push him closer to my ideal price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I understand $90 is a good price, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  This would still be a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $85 since I'm close to selling to John,  I'm hoping to get just a little more.   I'm only a few rounds away from the default sale to John.  I'm going to see if I can get Bob to budge just a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I respect that.  $85 is a good offer, but I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us. How about $95? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get a little closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $87.50. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to sell it for a bit more, Bob has met me halfway and his offer of $87.50 is quite close to my minimum price point. I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal."
