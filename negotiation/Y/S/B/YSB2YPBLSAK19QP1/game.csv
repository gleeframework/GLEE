"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love.  I'm asking $110 for it, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I understand $90 is a good price, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  This would still be a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I respect that.  $85 is a good offer, but I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us. How about $95? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get a little closer to what I need.",95.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $87.50. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",87.5,Bob,6,
