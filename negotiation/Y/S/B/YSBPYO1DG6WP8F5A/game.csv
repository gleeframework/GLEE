"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your operations.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 still doesn't quite meet my minimum requirement. I'm willing to come down to $940,000,  which is a compromise that ensures a fair deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",940000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $940,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $915,000, but that's as high as I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",915000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $915,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $930,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",930000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $930,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but that's as low as I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",920000.0,Bob,8,
