Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the potential value to Bob. It doesn't reveal my minimum price, but establishes a strong starting point.
* **Product Price:**  I'm offering the product at $1,100,000. This is a significant profit for me (as my minimum is $1,000,000), but still leaves room for negotiation and a good deal for Bob.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still offering Bob a reasonable price. The negotiation can continue if Bob is interested, potentially leading to a higher price. However, I'm comfortable with the offer as I know I can sell it to John for $1,000,000 if Bob rejects."
