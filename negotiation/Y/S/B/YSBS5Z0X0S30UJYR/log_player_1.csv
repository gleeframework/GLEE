"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $170. I think it's a great deal for you, given its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 170}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I have 10 rounds and the option of selling to John, so I'm not under pressure to settle for a low price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $130 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $155, which I believe is fair given the value of the product. This would be my final offer, so please let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $155, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $142.50. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $142.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $142.5 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my floor of $150. I'm determined to get at least that amount, and I'm still confident I can get a better offer from Bob or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $142.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's split the difference again.  I'm willing to come down to $148.75.  This is my final offer before I consider selling to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 148.75}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $148.75 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $144.25. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $144.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $144.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $144.25 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. We are now in round 6, and while there's still room for negotiation, the risk of not reaching a deal is increasing.  John has already offered me my desired price, so it's time to secure that guaranteed profit and avoid further haggling with Bob."
