Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $100,  starting with an offer slightly above his valuation leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Creating Perceived Value:** The message emphasizes ""special price"" and ""great deal"" to make Bob feel like he's getting an advantage.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering at $125 leaves space to potentially negotiate down slightly if Bob hesitates, while still securing a profit above your minimum. If Bob rejects the offer, you're still guaranteed your desired $150 from John."
