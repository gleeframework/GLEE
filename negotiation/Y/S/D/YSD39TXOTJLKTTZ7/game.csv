"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $1,300,000 is far above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is my best offer, as I'm limited to spending no more than $800,000, and I'm already pushing my budget with this offer.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product offers.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm prepared to go up to $950,000, but that's my absolute maximum. It's a significant jump from my previous offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
