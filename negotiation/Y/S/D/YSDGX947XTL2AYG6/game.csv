"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I believe this price is a great value considering the product's exceptional quality and rarity.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering my budget constraints and the potential value of the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget constraints.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1100000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value and your budget constraints.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1050000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000, which is my absolute maximum. This price reflects the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints. If you're willing to accept this offer, we can finalize the transaction. Otherwise, I'll have to purchase the product from John.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
