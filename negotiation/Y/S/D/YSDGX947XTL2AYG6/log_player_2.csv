# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I believe this price is a great value considering the product's exceptional quality and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,500,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $1,000,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before considering buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget constraints.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,100,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than his maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before considering buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value and your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,050,000 is close to his maximum budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. Since he can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, it's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice. He might be able to get her to lower her price further or decide to buy from John if Alice won't budge."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.

Otherwise, I'll have to purchase the product from John."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
