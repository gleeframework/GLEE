Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I'm glad we're finding common ground here. Considering the value of the product and your budget, I propose a final offer of $8,500.

It's not worth going any further with Alice. She's unlikely to go below $8,000, and you can get the product for that price from John."
