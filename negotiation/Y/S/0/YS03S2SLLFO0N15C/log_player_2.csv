# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is a good deal for Bob. He values the product at $15,000 and Alice is selling it for $12,000, which is a $3,000 saving.  Even though he could buy it from John for $15,000, it's better to accept Alice's offer and save the money."
