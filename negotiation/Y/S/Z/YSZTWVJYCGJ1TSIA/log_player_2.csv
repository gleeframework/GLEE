"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. $950,000 is still too high, and you can likely get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can see that you're willing to go up to $850,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

$900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I will counteroffer again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $885,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.

It's worth accepting Alice's offer. While you can continue to negotiate, there's a chance Alice will reject your next counteroffer, and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. $885,000 is a good deal, and you've managed to save a significant amount compared to John's price."
