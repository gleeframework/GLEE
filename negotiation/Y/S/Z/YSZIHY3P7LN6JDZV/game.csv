"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'd be willing to come down to $975,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $975,000 is still a bit much for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
