``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000), hoping to maximize my profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, allowing for some negotiation. 
* **Positive and Encouraging:** The message is friendly and optimistic to create a positive atmosphere for the negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

```

**Reasoning:**

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to the final three rounds, and the offers are getting closer to my minimum but haven't crossed it yet.
* **Risk of Lower Price:** Continuing to negotiate risks that Bob will either refuse to increase his offer or we'll run out of time before reaching a deal.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $15,000 ensures I make my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee that I'll be able to get a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds. 

It's better to secure a guaranteed profit than to risk losing the deal entirely or settling for less than my minimum."
