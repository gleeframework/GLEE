"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is my best offer, but I'm open to negotiating further.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value this product brings while leaving room for a profitable venture on your end.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $950,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about meeting halfway, but the value of this product is truly undeniable. I can go down to $1,000,000 as my final offer. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a deal that benefits us both.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
