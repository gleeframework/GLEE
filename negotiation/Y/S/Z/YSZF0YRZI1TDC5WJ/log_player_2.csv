"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $10,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire an item valued at $12,000 by you, at a competitive price. Please let me know if this offer suits your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $10,000 is better than buying from John for $12,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. There's room for negotiation, as the product is worth $8,000 to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider it. However, I need to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I would like to counteroffer at $9,500 for the product. This allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement while ensuring a fair return for my efforts. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $12,000 and only slightly higher than Bob's initial counteroffer of $9,000. Accepting this offer allows Bob to purchase the product at a reasonable price while ensuring he gets a better deal than buying from John."
