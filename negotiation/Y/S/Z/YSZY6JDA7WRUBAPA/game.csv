"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $900,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm eager to finalize this deal, let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential benefits to your business.",875000.0,Alice,3,
