Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500.  I know it's valuable to you and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,500 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 provides a safety net. Alice won't accept anything less from Bob."
