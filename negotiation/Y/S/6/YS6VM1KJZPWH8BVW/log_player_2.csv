# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1500000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

You can do better than $1,400,000.  It's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if you can get a lower price."

Alice has come down to a price that's very close to your target, and it's likely they won't go any lower. It's a good deal for you, so accepting the offer makes sense."
