Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  To be honest, $1,200,000 is the very highest I could go.  If you're willing to come down to that, I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has made it clear that $1,200,000 is his absolute limit.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll bridge the gap to a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting John's offer ensures we get our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob failing."
