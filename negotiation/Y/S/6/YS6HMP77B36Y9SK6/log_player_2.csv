"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $120.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $120 is above your maximum budget of $150.
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds to reach a deal and can make counteroffers. It's likely you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, showing your willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable offer:**  $90 is a fair starting point, considering your maximum budget and Alice's likely minimum.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message encourages further discussion, leaving room for Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice's offer is lower, it's still above your preferred price range.
* **Room for negotiation:**  You have more rounds to negotiate and can likely get the price even lower. 
* **No urgency to buy now:** You can always purchase from John for $150, giving you time to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $100 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $95? This seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** The counteroffer suggests a middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's current offer.
* **Positive tone:**  The message maintains a positive tone, encouraging continued discussion.
* **Fairness emphasis:** Highlighting ""fairness"" for both parties helps build trust and motivate Alice to accept."
