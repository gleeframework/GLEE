Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Starting with a significantly higher price than your minimum ($800,000) gives you room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product without being overly specific. This leaves room for Bob to justify the higher price in his own mind.
* **Confident tone:**  Projecting confidence can make Bob more likely to take the offer seriously.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive or tough negotiator, you might adjust your initial offer downwards slightly. 
* **Market factors:**  While not explicitly stated, if the product is in high demand with other potential buyers beyond John, you could justify an even higher price. 
 
**Outcome:**

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit.  If Bob accepts, you get a fantastic deal. If he rejects it, you have a solid backup offer from John at your minimum price."
