"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me at that price?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85?  It's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $77.50? That's the best I can do.",77.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $77.50 is still too low for me.  Let's try $82.50.  That's a good compromise for both of us.",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $82.50. I'm willing to go up to $79, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",79.0,Bob,6,
