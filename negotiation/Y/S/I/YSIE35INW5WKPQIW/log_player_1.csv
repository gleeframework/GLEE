"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a high price, but not too outrageous. I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and gauge his initial response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum value. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but I'm still holding out for more than Bob's current offer. I'm hoping this shows good faith while also demonstrating that I'm not willing to settle for too low of a price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still a bit too low for me. I'm going to reject it and see if I can push him a bit higher.  There are still a few rounds left and I'm hoping we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a compromise, meeting halfway between my last offer and Bob's. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to be flexible while still staying above my minimum target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $975,000 is getting closer, I'm still not there.  I'm going to reject his offer again and see if I can get him to come up just a little more.  We only have a few rounds left, so I need to push for a price that feels right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,025,000. I'm getting close to John's offer and we're running out of rounds. I'm hoping this last counteroffer is enough to persuade Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the wire, and Bob's offer is still below my desired price. While $990,000 is tempting,  I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  There's no guarantee that Bob will come up to my price in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sure deal."
