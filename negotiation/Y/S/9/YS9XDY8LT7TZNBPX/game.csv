"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell, but $16,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your offer, but $13,000 is still a little out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm serious about buying the product. What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $12,000 is the lowest I can go and still make this worthwhile for me.  Do we have a deal at that price?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a fair price for both of us. If we can meet in the middle, I'm ready to buy the product today.",11000.0,Bob,6,
