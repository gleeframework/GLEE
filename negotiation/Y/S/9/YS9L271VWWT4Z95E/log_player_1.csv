"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). This is a common tactic in negotiations.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While $1,500,000 is my initial ask, I'm prepared to negotiate downwards. This leaves room for Bob to make counteroffers.
* **Understanding John's offer:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay $1,000,000, but I'm hoping to get a better deal with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's potential value:**  I have no information about Bob's perceived value of the product. This initial high offer allows me to gauge his interest and understand his potential budget.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk that Bob will reject my initial offer. However, the potential reward of a higher selling price justifies this strategy.
* **Limited Rounds:**  I'm mindful of the 10-round limit and will adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and the remaining rounds."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is promising:**  $1,200,000 is closer to my desired price range.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Since I have 9 rounds left, rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially reach a higher price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  While I'm hoping for a better deal with Bob, I know I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 as a fallback option. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $1,400,000 in the next round. This strategy aims to gradually close the gap between our respective offers while maintaining leverage for a better deal."
