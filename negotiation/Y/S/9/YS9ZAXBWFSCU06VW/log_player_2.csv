"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm offering it to you at $1,400,000. I think this is a fair starting point for discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for cheaper from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price. It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice to see if she's willing to come down."

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is closer to his ideal price, it's still higher than what John is offering. It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice further. There's a chance she might come down even further."

This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this point."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
