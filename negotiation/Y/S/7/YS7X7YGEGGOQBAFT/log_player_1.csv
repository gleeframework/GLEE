"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept it immediately. This is a strong opening move that establishes my desired value for the product and leaves room for negotiation.  I'm setting the stage to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. I am confident I can secure a better price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still aiming for a price above $1,000,000 to ensure I'm getting a good return. This counteroffer allows room for further negotiation while still maintaining my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can push for a slightly higher price.  I'm choosing to reject the offer and continue negotiating, as selling to John for $1,000,000 is still an acceptable option if this negotiation falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price again, but still aiming for a profit. This offer is just above Bob's last offer and shows I am serious about reaching an agreement. I believe this is a fair compromise and a good chance to close the deal. If Bob rejects again, I will consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to $1,050,000, the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or even losing the deal altogether outweighs the potential gain.  Also, I am approaching the end of the negotiation rounds, and selling to John is still a viable option if this deal falls through. Therefore, I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to secure the sale."
