# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a significant return on investment for you.

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's more than double your budget.  You should reject and counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its potential.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 undervalues the product's true potential. I've done extensive research and analysis, and I'm confident this product will generate significant returns for you. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a competitive offer considering the value it represents. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high for my budget.  It's time to make another counteroffer.  While I want to save as much money as possible, I also need to keep in mind that there's a chance Alice might get impatient and decide to sell to John instead."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,000,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the product's potential value while still being within my budget.  Let's try to find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point that reflects the value of this product. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to consider $1,650,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to try one more time to get closer to my budget.  If she rejects this offer, I'll buy from John."
