"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a significant return on investment for you.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its potential.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 undervalues the product's true potential. I've done extensive research and analysis, and I'm confident this product will generate significant returns for you. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a competitive offer considering the value it represents.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,000,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the product's potential value while still being within my budget.  Let's try to find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point that reflects the value of this product. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to consider $1,650,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. This is my final offer, as I'm ready to purchase from John if we can't come to an agreement.  Let's make this happen.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
