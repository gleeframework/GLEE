Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11,999. I think it's a great deal for something of this value, and I know you'll benefit from it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice aims to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible, while still exceeding her minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum gives him the perception of a deal while leaving Alice room to potentially negotiate further. 
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, so there's little risk in starting with a higher offer to Bob."
