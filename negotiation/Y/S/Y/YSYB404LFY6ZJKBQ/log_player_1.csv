Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's only slightly above my minimum value, it's the best price I've received from Bob so far. I'm also running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk getting a worse offer from Bob or having to sell to John for less."
