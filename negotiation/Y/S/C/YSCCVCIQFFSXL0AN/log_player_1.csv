Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it's a great deal and you'll find it valuable."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Starting at $150 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, there's a chance he might counter-offer, giving you an opportunity to negotiate a price higher than $100."
