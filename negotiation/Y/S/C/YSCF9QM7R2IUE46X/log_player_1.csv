Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity for you, and I'm offering it to you first. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $950,000."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, there's a chance to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. It aims to:
    * Anchor the price high in Bob's mind.
    * Signal the product's high value.
    * Leave space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price higher than John's offer.
* **Risk Assessment:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, the potential for extra profit outweighs the risk of going directly to John, who is a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000."
