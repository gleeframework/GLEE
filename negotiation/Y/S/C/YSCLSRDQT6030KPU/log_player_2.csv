Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate the creative thinking, but $11,375 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer the product to you for $11,750, which is the same price I offered in round 7. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut bait. Alice is clearly very attached to that $11,750 price and unwilling to budge further.  While you *might* be able to squeeze out a tiny bit more from her in the last round, it's risky. John offers a sure thing at $12,000, and at this point, the potential savings from Alice aren't worth the risk of her not budging and you losing out."
