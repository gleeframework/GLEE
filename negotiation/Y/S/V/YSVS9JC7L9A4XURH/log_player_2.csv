Alice's offer is still higher than your maximum budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get a lower price. You can try to meet her halfway or offer a slightly lower price.  If she rejects again, then it might be time to consider buying from John."

I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
