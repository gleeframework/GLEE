"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit out of my range. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1100000.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay above my minimum price point. While your offer is enticing, I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll consider it.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to stay above a certain price, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, which is a considerable increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
