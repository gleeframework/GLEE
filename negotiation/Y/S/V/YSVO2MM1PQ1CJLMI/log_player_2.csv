"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. I think it's a great deal for both of us, given its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $14,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to accept $13,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. $13500 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to go down to $13750. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,750 is still a better deal than buying from John for $15,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject his counteroffer and he'd be left with no choice but to buy from John.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures a good deal and avoids potential further negotiation risks."
