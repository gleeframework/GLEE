{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us, given its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000 is a good starting point.** It's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and open to discussion.** This sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **I'm highlighting the value to Bob.** This makes the offer more appealing and emphasizes the potential win-win situation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $14000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to accept $13500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $14,000. I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. $13,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to go down to $13,750. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer.**  This shows I'm taking his offer seriously and being respectful.
* **I'm proposing a compromise.** $13,750 is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's. 
* **I'm reiterating the value to Bob.**  This reinforces the win-win potential of the deal.
* **I'm expressing a sense of urgency.**  This encourages Bob to close the deal."
