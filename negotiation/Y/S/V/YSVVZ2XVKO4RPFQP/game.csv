"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  However, the product offers unique advantages and a quality that justifies a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant concession on my part and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  Let's be realistic, though.  At $950,000, I'm sacrificing significant value. To move this forward, I can go as low as $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting close, but I need you to understand this product's true worth. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000, but this is absolutely my final offer. It's a significant discount, and I need to make a decision.  Do we have a deal?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
