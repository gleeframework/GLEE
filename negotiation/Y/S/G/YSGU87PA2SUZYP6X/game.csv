,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $70 for the product.  Let's see if we can make a deal.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 was a bit steep, but $70 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $95. I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85. This is a fair price considering your asking price and my budget. Let's see if we can make this work.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 was a bit high, and $85 is a good compromise, but I'm still not sure if I can let it go for that price. I'm willing to meet you at $92. It's a bit higher than $85, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $92 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $88. This is my final offer, as I'm very close to my budget. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to go with another seller.",88.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're close to your budget, but I'm not willing to go below $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $88 and $92, which is $90. I think it's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to compromise.",90.0,Alice,7,
