Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to be flexible, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $9,000, which would be $8,250.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and you have a guaranteed option with John at $8,000. It's time to cut your losses and take the sure thing."
