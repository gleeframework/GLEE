"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great value at $12,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I see the value in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we meet in the middle at $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $6,000 and $12,000, which would be $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something under $8,000.  Would you consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to be flexible, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $9,000, which would be $8,250. However, I'm also keeping in mind that I can sell this product to John for $10,000, so I'm not willing to go too low. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,5,
