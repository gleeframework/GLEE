"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $17500?  This would still be a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $17500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $12000 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about we settle at $14000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it would ensure that you get a fantastic product at a very competitive price.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at $12000.",12000.0,Bob,6,
