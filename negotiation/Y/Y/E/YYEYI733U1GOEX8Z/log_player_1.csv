Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a final price of $10000.

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum price, but I've already had several rounds of negotiation and there's no guarantee he'll accept a counteroffer.  Selling to John now guarantees I get my minimum price and saves me time and energy."
