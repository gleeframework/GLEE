Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $130 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $130 is more than your minimum of $100, ensuring you're making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $130 is less than Bob's value of $150, leaving room for negotiation and making the offer attractive to him.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  A significant discount from Bob's value signals a willingness to negotiate, but still leaves room for you to potentially make more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit high for me. How about $115? Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still worth negotiating further. You can likely get closer to your target price of $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $122.50?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 122.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $122.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $120. Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is very close to your target of $130 and above your minimum of $100.  It's a good deal, and further negotiation may not be worth the time and effort."
