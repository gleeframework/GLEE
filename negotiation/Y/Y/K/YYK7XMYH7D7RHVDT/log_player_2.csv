"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not quite ready to sell it for $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about $95, would that work for you?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $102? It's getting close to my minimum, but I think it's a fair price for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is down to $102.  This is a good price and keeps us well below our $120 maximum. It's unlikely we'll get a much better offer from Alice at this point."
