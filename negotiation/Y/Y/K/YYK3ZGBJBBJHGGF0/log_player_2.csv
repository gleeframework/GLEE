Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is still a great deal, considering the value it will bring to your business.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider your offer of $10,250. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $10,500.  At this point, cutting my losses and buying from John at $10,000 is the most financially sound decision."
