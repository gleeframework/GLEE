Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value, but it still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my ideal price, it's still better than nothing. However, I am willing to negotiate further.  I believe I can get a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer to $1,000,000.  This is still a significant profit for me, and I believe it's a fair price given Bob's initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to accept his offer, as continuing to negotiate risks losing him as a buyer altogether. This deal is still a significant profit for me."
