Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $115 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially ending up at a price higher than John's offer. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** While aiming high, a price too close to $120 might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal and could lead to rejection. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
