"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $600,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $900,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle somewhere in the middle, say $750,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a price of $850,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
