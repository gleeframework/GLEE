"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the current market.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This still leaves some room for negotiation, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This seems like a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
