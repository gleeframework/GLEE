"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you're excited about the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $130. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $115?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach a deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $115 is still a bit below my minimum price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $125. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
