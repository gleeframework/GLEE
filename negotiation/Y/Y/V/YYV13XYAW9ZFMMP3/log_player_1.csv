Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my absolute minimum price, $1,000,000. This is because I know I can always sell to John for that price if Bob doesn't accept. This gives me the best chance to get the highest possible price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise between my minimum and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob altogether. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
