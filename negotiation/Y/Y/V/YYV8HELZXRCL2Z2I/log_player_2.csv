Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident we can find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while being reasonable for you.  Let's make this deal happen!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we may not be able to reach an agreement.  $1,450,000 is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'll go down to $1,550,000, but this is my final offer.  It's a good deal for both of us, so let's finalize this.
