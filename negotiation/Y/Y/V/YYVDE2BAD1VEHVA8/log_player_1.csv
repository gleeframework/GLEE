Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product,  $800,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.  This still represents a significant profit for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.
