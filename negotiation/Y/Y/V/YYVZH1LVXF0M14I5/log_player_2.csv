"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is asking for $135, which is $15 more than I'm willing to pay. I'll look elsewhere.
