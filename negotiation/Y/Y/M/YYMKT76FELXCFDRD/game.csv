"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a little closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $980,000?",980000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your desire to get closer to $1,000,000, Bob. However, I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $980,000. I'm offering the product to you for $965,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",965000.0,Alice,3,
