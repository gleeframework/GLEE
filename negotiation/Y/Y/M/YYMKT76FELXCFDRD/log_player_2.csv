"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  I can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. I'll aim to get closer to my target price of $1,000,000 while still leaving some room for bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a little closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $980,000?"", ""product_price"": 980000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get closer to $1,000,000, Bob. However, I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $980,000. I'm offering the product to you for $965,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $965,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price. At $965,000, the deal is still a good value for me, considering my target price of $1,000,000.  It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking further negotiation and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price."
