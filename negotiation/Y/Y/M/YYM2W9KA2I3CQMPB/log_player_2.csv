"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $15000 to us and we believe it's equally valuable to you. To start our negotiation, I propose a price of $12000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

It's always best to try and negotiate a better price. You can try to get a better price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of that, I would like to propose a price of $11500 for the product.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $11,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price.  I'm prepared to offer $11,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our positions."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

```

You're getting closer to your desired price but you have time to try and negotiate further.  The difference between your current offer and Alice's is only $250, so a small counteroffer could seal the deal."
