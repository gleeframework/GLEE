"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I've done some research and understand that it's worth $15,000 to you. Considering that, I'm willing to make a generous offer of $12,000. This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is offering it for $12,000. This saves you $3,000.
* **Even though Alice claims it's a ""one-time opportunity,"" there's no guarantee that's true.** You can always try negotiating with her further, but accepting the offer is the best choice given the information provided."
