Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, I'm offering it to him at that price. This ensures that he's willing to buy it, and I get the maximum value for my product. While I could potentially ask for a higher price, there's no guarantee he'd accept, and I'd be left with selling it to John for $1,500,000 anyway."
