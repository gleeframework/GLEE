"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal and I believe you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let me know your thoughts.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $13,500. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but $13,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $15,500, which is a good compromise.  This is a valuable product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know if you're interested.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but $15,500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $14,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate.  $14,500 is closer, but I'm still not there.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this works for you.",15000.0,Alice,7,
