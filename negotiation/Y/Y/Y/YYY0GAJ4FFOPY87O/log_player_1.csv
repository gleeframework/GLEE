Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low.  This product offers you significant value, worth well over $1,000,000 to both of us. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,075,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're very close to a deal that delivers exceptional value. I appreciate your position. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,100,000? This is a fair offer considering the significant benefits the product brings."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

Bob is clearly trying to get the best possible deal, but his offer is now above your minimum and represents a significant profit. Accepting avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling."
