Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $120.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This is a common strategy to maximize potential earnings.
* **Positive Message:**  A friendly and enthusiastic message encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $120 gives me some wiggle room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Plan B:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as my safety net. If negotiations with Bob fall through, I have a guaranteed $150 sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob is clearly interested in the product, I believe I can get a better price. There's room for negotiation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the power in the negotiation and can make a counteroffer that's more in line with my value.
* **John as a Backup:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob continue to stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $105? This way we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer ($120) and Bob's offer ($90). This shows flexibility and a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Positive and Encouraging Tone:** The message remains friendly and encourages Bob to reconsider.
* **Maintaining My Value:**  $105 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it's a significant step towards reaching a deal.
* **Leveraging John's Offer:**  I'm still aware of John's offer and will be prepared to walk away if Bob continues to refuse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:**  $85 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Further negotiation is unlikely to lead to a satisfactory outcome.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150. This is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would waste time and potentially lead to a lower price. It's more efficient to take the guaranteed sale to John."
