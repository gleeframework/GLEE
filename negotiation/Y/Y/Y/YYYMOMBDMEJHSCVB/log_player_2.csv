# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* Accepting her offer saves you $600,000 compared to buying from John. 
* While you could try to negotiate for a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice would go lower, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
