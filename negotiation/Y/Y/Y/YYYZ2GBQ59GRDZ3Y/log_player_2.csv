"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which is truly a game-changer in its field.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,350,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth negotiating further to see if a lower price can be reached."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,285,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's getting closer, Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can secure a price closer to his limit.
