"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm aiming to stay within a budget of $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still hesitant to go above $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,050,000? ",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,080,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.
