"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $100. I believe it's a great value for you and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum of $80, but I'm leaving room for negotiation. It's important to start high and see where Bob is willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm looking to save some money, but I'm willing to pay a fair price for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $90? I'm confident you'll still be getting a great deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to go up to $85, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial price, Bob's offer of $85 is very close to what I'm willing to accept.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $80.  I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
