"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,200,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is still a fair price considering its potential benefits for you. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,400,000. However, I still think that's a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
