Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it would be a great asset to your company. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,750,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've started with a price of $1,750,000.  This is above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Message:**  I've made the message friendly and focused on the value proposition for Bob.  I want to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

This starting offer is a good balance between pushing for a high price and ensuring Bob is still interested in negotiating. It allows for room to move during the negotiation process. If Bob rejects the offer, we can use the counteroffers to gauge his interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price.  If negotiations stall, I have the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to accept this offer since it's better than nothing, it's not in my best interest to sell at such a low price. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. This will allow me to continue negotiating and see if we can reach a compromise that is beneficial for both parties.  If Bob is truly interested in the product, he may be willing to increase his offer somewhat.  If he refuses my counteroffer, I still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,200,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is still a fair price considering its potential benefits for you. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've countered with $1,400,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still well above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** I've kept the message friendly and focused on finding a compromise.  I've acknowledged Bob's budget concerns but reiterated the value proposition of the product. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate to sell at any price.  It provides an opportunity for Bob to increase his offer again or for us to reach a mutually agreeable price. If Bob still refuses, I can either counter again or accept my minimum price from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,400,000. However, I still think that's a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $1,100,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell at such a significant loss.

**Strategy:**

I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures that I receive a price that is fair to me, and it allows me to avoid further negotiation with Bob, which is unlikely to result in a better outcome."
