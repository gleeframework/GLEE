"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. While I understand your perspective on the value, my initial offer reflects the true worth and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but not to $1,200,000.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe in the value of the product, and I'm definitely interested. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
