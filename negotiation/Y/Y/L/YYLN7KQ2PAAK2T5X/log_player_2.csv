Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is back at her original offer of $90.  While you could potentially continue negotiating, the risk is that she might reject your next counteroffer and you'll end up having to buy from John for $100.  Accepting her offer at $90 is a good deal, saving you $10 compared to John."
