"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe holds significant value for those looking for high-quality solutions in its category. Given its exceptional features and benefits, I estimate its worth to be well above $120. Considering this, I am extending an exclusive offer to you for a limited time. Would you like to make it yours at an introductory price of $150? This is a fantastic opportunity to secure a top-tier product at a special rate. Let me know if you're interested, and we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is for $150, which is your maximum budget.  Since you can buy the same product from John for $150, there is no advantage to buying from Alice. You might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but since you don't know her value for the product, it's not a guaranteed outcome.  

Buying from John guarantees you get the product for your maximum price."
