"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500, which is a significant discount from its true value. Let me know if you're interested!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible while still buying the product.  Since John is selling the product for $8,000, which is within Bob's budget, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
