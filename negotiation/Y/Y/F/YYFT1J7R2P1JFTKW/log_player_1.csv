Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $140 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than John's $100 offer.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at Bob's maximum valuation ($150) might seem too aggressive and could make him less likely to negotiate.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale."
