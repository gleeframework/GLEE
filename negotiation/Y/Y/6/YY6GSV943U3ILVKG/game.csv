"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $13,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $13,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $10,750? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,750 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,200. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $11,200 is getting close, but I'm aiming for something under $11,000. Would you be willing to consider $10,900?",10900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your target price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much money on the deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,050. This is the lowest I can go without sacrificing my profit margin.",11050.0,Alice,7,
