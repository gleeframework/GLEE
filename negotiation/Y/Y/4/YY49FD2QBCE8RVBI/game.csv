"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $90. It's a fair price for a product of this quality, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a little closer, but I'm still hoping to find something a bit more budget-friendly. How about $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the purchase.",95.0,Alice,5,
