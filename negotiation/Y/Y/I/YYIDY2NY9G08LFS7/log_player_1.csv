Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy Alice should employ, followed by the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Power:** Alice has a strong position. She has a guaranteed buyer (John) at her desired price. This allows her to be firm in her negotiation with Bob.
* **Bob's Motivation:** Bob stands to gain $500,000 in value if he acquires the product. This provides a window for Alice to capture some of that gain.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim for a price that's significantly higher than John's offer while still leaving Bob with a compelling reason to buy.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will generate significant returns for you. I'm prepared to make this deal happen for $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Why This Price?**

* **Profitable for Alice:**  Alice secures a $350,000 profit over her guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Attractive to Bob:** Bob still realizes a substantial $150,000 gain compared to his alternative.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Bob might counter-offer. Alice should be prepared to negotiate slightly downward but hold firm around the $1,300,000 mark.
* **Confidence is Key:** Alice should present her offer confidently.  She knows the product's worth and has a strong fallback option."
