Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $950,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $920,000, which is $935,000. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.

While I could push for more, Bob is consistently moving towards my position and we're now at a very good price of $935,000. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or me having to settle for John's offer later."
