"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

 Alice's offer is higher than our maximum price. We can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105?"",
 ""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start lower:** We begin by countering significantly lower than Alice's offer but above her value. This leaves room for negotiation and signals we're looking for a good deal. 
* **Polite and interested:** We maintain a friendly and interested tone to encourage Alice to continue the negotiation.
* **Strategic positioning:** Our counteroffer is closer to Alice's value, increasing the chances she might accept a price in this range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I can offer you the product for $115. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While Alice lowered her price, it's not a significant drop. We have room to negotiate further as it's still above her value.
* **Avoid rushing:** Accepting now might mean leaving money on the table. We've shown we're willing to negotiate, and Alice seems open to it. 
* **John is our backup:** We have the safety net of buying from John at $150. This allows us to be a bit more assertive in our negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:**  By suggesting $110, we're showing a willingness to compromise while still nudging the price closer to our target range.
* **Framing as a win-win:**  Positioning the offer as a ""fair compromise"" aims to make it more appealing to Alice. 
* **Time pressure:**  While we haven't explicitly stated it, each counteroffer implies we're considering John's offer more seriously. This subtle time pressure might encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! Meeting in the middle at $110 is a good starting point. However, I was really hoping to get a bit closer to my original offer. Would you be willing to go up to $112? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minor difference:**  The difference between $110 and $112 is small. Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better result and could risk alienating Alice.
* **Good deal overall:** We're getting the product for $38 less than John's price, which is a significant saving.
* **Alice is motivated:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but this latest counteroffer suggests she's getting closer to her bottom line.

It's a good time to accept the offer and secure a good deal!"
