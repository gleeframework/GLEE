"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I can offer you the product for $115. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! Meeting in the middle at $110 is a good starting point. However, I was really hoping to get a bit closer to my original offer. Would you be willing to go up to $112? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",112.0,Alice,5,
