"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $800,000.  Let's start there and see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $800,000 is a lot of money, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll counter Bob's offer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints.  While $800,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1,200,000?  It's a fair price that gives us both room to work with."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my initial offer, showing my commitment to reaching a deal. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter Bob's offer again, but I'm running out of time. I need to be more aggressive in my negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your budget limitations, but $950,000 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my desired price.  How about $1,100,000?  This is a significant compromise on my end.  It's a final offer before I explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,100,000 is still a bit high, but I'm prepared to go up to $1,000,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of your product. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement at this level. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I need to be more strategic and try to push for a better deal.  There's still time to negotiate with Bob, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,000,000,  I'm still a bit below where I need to be. I'm open to a final compromise â€“  $1,050,000. This would allow me to move forward with the deal while also ensuring a fair price for my product. I'm ready to close this deal at this price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your need for a fair price. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, which is a significant compromise for me. I believe this represents a fair value for the product and allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a deal that doesn't meet my needs.  It's time to sell to John and ensure I get the value I deserve for my product."
