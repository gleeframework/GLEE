,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, $12500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! However, $13000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $13500. This is my final offer, but I think it's a great deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
