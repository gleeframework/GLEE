{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for compromise.  By offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, I am increasing the likelihood of him accepting the offer.  At the same time, I am ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120, so I will reject it and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $105 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $105. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $108 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's still below my target.  Given the possibility of selling to John for $120, I'm going to go ahead and accept that offer.  It's less negotiating, and I'll get a better price."
