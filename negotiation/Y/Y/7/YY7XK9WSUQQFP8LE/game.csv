"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $16,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to go lower?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle? Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is right in the middle of our two offers.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10000.0,Bob,4,
