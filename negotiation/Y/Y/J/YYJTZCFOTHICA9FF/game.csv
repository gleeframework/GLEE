"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $9,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8,750? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, but I'm still not quite there with $8,750. Let's meet in the middle at $8,875. I'm willing to make this final concession to seal the deal. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",8875.0,Alice,5,
