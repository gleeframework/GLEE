"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This still leaves room for both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1000000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $900000.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere.  I understand you have a budget, but $900000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $950000. This is the absolute lowest I can go.  Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
