``` 

This offer is a starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate further depending on Bob's response.  It's important to note that this offer is still significantly above Bob's perceived value, giving him room to bargain while still leaving me a significant profit. I'm also keeping in mind the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than my minimum acceptable value. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still leaves room for both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1000000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $900000.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not enough. I will reject his offer and make one final counteroffer before considering selling to John.  There's still a possibility of reaching a deal with Bob, but I need to ensure I receive a price that reflects the product's worth."
