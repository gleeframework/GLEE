"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is in the middle of my minimum value ($100) and Bob's estimated value ($150). This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and is likely to be appealing to him as a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $115.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $115 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $130.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $122.50? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 122.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $122.50 is still too high for me. Let's try $120. That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $120 is a good price, it's very close to my target of $130, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
