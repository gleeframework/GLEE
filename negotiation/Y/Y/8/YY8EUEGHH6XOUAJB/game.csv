"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. I believe this price is fair and allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product is significant and $1,000,000 is below its true worth.  I could consider letting it go for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. Let's finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
