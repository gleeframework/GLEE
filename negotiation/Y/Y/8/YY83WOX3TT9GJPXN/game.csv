,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $135. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",135.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $134. This is my last offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",134.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $134, Bob. I've already given you a good deal, and I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margin any further. If you're not willing to meet me at $134, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other offers.",134.0,Alice,9,
