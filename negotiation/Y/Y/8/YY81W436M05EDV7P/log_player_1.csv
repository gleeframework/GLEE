Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $130. This is a good starting point, leaving some room for negotiation while still securing a profit above my minimum of $100. I'm confident Bob will be interested in buying it as it's worth $150 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and accepting it will guarantee a sale with minimal effort. I can always try to negotiate a higher price later."
