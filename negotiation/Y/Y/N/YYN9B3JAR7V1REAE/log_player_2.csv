# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at over $1000000 to me, but I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While I can't go as low as $1050000, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $1150000?

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,150,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a lower price. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This would be a fair price that benefits us both. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate the continued negotiation. While $1100000 is close, I'm still aiming for a bit higher. How about $1125000? This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while remaining within your budget. Let's find a mutually beneficial solution, and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is within your budget and represents a significant discount from her initial offer.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely or having Alice walk away. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price within your budget and avoids the risk of needing to buy from John at a much higher cost."
