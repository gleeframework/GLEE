"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm really interested in this product and would be willing to pay $1050000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While I can't go as low as $1050000, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $1150000? This is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1150000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a lower price. I'm willing to offer $1100000 for the product. This would be a fair price that benefits us both. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate the continued negotiation. While $1100000 is close, I'm still aiming for a bit higher. How about $1125000?
