Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm really interested in this product and would be willing to pay $1050000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my desired price point, I'm still confident I can get a bit more. I'm not desperate to sell and have another buyer ready to purchase at $1,000,000, which gives me negotiating power. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
