"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that I believe would significantly enhance your endeavors and contribute greatly to your success. After careful consideration, I propose that we explore a mutually beneficial arrangement where you could purchase this valuable asset for $1,200,000. This price reflects not only the intrinsic value of the product but also acknowledges its potential impact on your business or personal projects.

Given your expressed interest and the high value you place on this product ($800,000), I am confident that we can reach an agreement that satisfies both our needs. Should you require any additional information or have questions about the product, please do not hesitate to contact me. I am more than happy to provide you with detailed specifications, testimonials, and any other resources that might help you make an informed decision.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this proposal and discussing how we can proceed together.

Best regards,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer might be tempting, you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000. Accepting Alice's offer would mean spending $400,000 more than your maximum budget. You can reject Alice's offer and proceed with purchasing from John, ensuring you stay within your budget."
