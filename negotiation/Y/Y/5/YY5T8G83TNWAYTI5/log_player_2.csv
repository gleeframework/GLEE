"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $900,000 is still above your desired price range.
* **Negotiation potential:** You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate a lower price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Alice fail, you have a backup option. 

By rejecting the offer, you can try to get a better price from Alice in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** My counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing I'm serious about getting a better price. 
* **Meeting in the middle:** $850,000 is halfway between Alice's minimum ($800,000) and my maximum ($900,000). This makes it a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* **Room for more negotiation:** I still have 9 rounds, so there's room for Alice to counteroffer if she's not happy with this price, and for me to make further adjustments."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:** Alice has dropped her price to $875,000, which is closer to my target range.
* **Acceptable Price:** While I'd ideally like to pay even less, $875,000 is within my budget and represents a good deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk of reaching an impasse or running out of rounds. Accepting now secures the product at a favorable price."
