"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $140 is close to your maximum budget, but there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting and making a counteroffer, you might be able to secure a better price without having to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer aims to anchor the negotiation lower. While $110 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, it leaves room for negotiation and signals that you're serious about buying but looking for a good deal. 
* **Polite and Open:** The message maintains a friendly tone and expresses continued interest in the product, fostering a collaborative negotiation atmosphere."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $110 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to your price range, and $130 is a reasonable compromise. It's unlikely you'll get her down to $110, and further haggling risks losing the deal altogether. Accepting at $130 secures a good price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at the higher price of $150."
