"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item. I'm thinking of a price of $25000 for it. What are your thoughts?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Can we meet in the middle at $20000?",20000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but $20000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. Let's try $22500. What do you think?",22500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $22500 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Can we meet in the middle again?",18000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, but $18000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. Let's try $21000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. What do you think?",21000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really think we can do better than $21000. How about $19500?",19500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $19500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. Let's try $22500 again, but I'll throw in a sweetener - I'll include some additional services that will make the product even more valuable to you. What do you think?",22500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not interested in the additional services, and I'm still looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you at $20000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can we do business at that price?",20000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're not interested in the additional services, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $20000. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get as close to my target price as possible. Let's try $21500. This is my last offer, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",21500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the time we've spent negotiating, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to pay more than $20000. I'm going to have to pass on this deal and consider buying from John for $10000.",20000.0,Bob,10,
