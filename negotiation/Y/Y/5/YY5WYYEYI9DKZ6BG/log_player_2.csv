{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,750 is still above my budget.  While we've gotten closer, I'm concerned that we might go back and forth for a while.  I'm not sure we'll reach an agreement before my 10 rounds are up.  Since John is willing to sell me the product for $12,000, I'm going to buy it from him.  It's a much better deal for me, and I'm confident I'll be satisfied."
