{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring a profitable deal for me.  I'll see how Bob responds before considering a counteroffer or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's less than what you value the product at."", ""product_price"": 10000}
