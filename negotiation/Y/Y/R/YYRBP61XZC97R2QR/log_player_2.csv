"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $130. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price, considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a lower price that's still beneficial to both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to find a middle ground. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still provides her with a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is too low for me. How about $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving in the right direction, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to get the price a bit lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to split the difference between my last offer and Alice's current price.  It keeps the negotiation moving while still pushing for a better deal."
