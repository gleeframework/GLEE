**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently lowballing and doesn't seem to be valuing the product at a level where we'll reach a mutually agreeable price.  He's moved only $200,000 from his initial offer while I've come down $600,000.  At this point, the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially getting an even lower offer outweighs the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to the guaranteed sale."
