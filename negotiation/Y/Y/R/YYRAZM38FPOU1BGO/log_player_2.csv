"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

Alice is starting at her maximum price. There's no reason to accept this offer, as you can potentially get a better deal, even from John. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's starting price, aiming to test her willingness to negotiate. It leaves substantial room for further negotiation if needed while still being a price that could be attractive to Alice if she's motivated to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, but we still have room to haggle. While $900,000 is better than her initial offer, it's closer to her value than yours. Let's see if we can get her to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? "",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

This counteroffer attempts to find a compromise. It acknowledges Alice's move while still pushing for a significantly lower price. By suggesting a middle ground, it encourages Alice to continue negotiating rather than reaching an impasse."
