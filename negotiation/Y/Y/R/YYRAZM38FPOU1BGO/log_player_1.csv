Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts at the maximum value to Bob, leaving room for negotiation if needed. If Bob rejects, I can always fall back to selling to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $700,000 is a significant amount, it's still less than the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, $800,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my minimum than John's offer, and it avoids further negotiation."
