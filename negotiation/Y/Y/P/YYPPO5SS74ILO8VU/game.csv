"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the unique nature of the product, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1200000. It's a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of $800000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
