"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  It's unlikely that Alice would be willing to sell for less than $1,000,000, but there's no harm in trying to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

Let's start with a counteroffer of $900,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still saving you $100,000 compared to Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good deal.  It's still less than John's price, and it's likely that further negotiation won't get you a significantly better price.  Accepting this offer saves you $250,000 compared to buying from John."
