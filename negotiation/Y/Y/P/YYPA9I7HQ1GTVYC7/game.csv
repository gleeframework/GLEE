"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $950,000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, recognizing its value to both of us. This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $920,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $920,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $880,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to your last proposal. This offer is fair and gives us both an opportunity to close this deal.

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920,000 and $880,000, which brings us to $900,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a good compromise considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
