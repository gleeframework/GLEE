"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. This is a significant price drop from your initial offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? I'm confident this is a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply not enough for me. Let's split the difference once again. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that will make us both happy.  Let's reach an agreement on this round, and avoid further delays.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $975,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we've been going back and forth for a while now. I value your time and effort in this negotiation, but honestly, $975,000 simply isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $1,012,500. This is a very fair compromise and I believe it's the best chance we have to finalize a deal.  Let's make this happen.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm starting to feel like we're not getting any closer to a deal. I'm willing to make one final offer, and that's $975,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. This is my final offer.",975000.0,Bob,8,
