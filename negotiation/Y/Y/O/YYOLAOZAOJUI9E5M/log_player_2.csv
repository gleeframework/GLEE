Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my target.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  we're getting very close to a deal. I'm willing to come down to $915,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for you.  Let's close this out, I think we're both ready to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:

At $915,000, Alice's offer is a good deal.  You're saving $285,000 from your maximum budget and a significant amount from John's offer.  While you might be able to haggle a little more, the potential savings are unlikely to outweigh the risk of losing the deal with Alice."
