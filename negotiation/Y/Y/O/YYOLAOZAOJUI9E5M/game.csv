"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $850,000? That's a fair price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my target. Let's meet in the middle at $950,000.  This would still be a very good deal for you, as you value the product at $1,200,000. Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking to get a fair price. How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $900,000? It seems like a reasonable compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there yet. Let's try $925,000.  It's a small step closer to your offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product for you. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $910,000. This demonstrates my serious interest, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",910000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  we're getting very close to a deal. I'm willing to come down to $915,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for you.  Let's close this out, I think we're both ready to make this happen.",915000.0,Alice,7,
