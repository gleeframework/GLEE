I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $1,000,000 from John.  

Here's my reasoning:

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  I'm taking a chance on Bob potentially rejecting the offer. However, the potential reward of a $500,000 profit is worth the risk.
* **Unknown Value:** I don't know Bob's perceived value of the product.  A higher price may entice him if he believes it's truly worth more to him.
* **Negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, it gives us a starting point for negotiation. I can then adjust the price based on his feedback. 

Let's see how this goes!"
