"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $20,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous counteroffer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but I must adhere to my budgetary constraints. I am willing to increase my offer to $12,000. This still leaves me within my financial limits while offering a reasonable price for the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, $12,000 is too low.  My final offer is $15,000. This allows me to get closer to market value, and I'm confident it's a price you won't find elsewhere for this quality.",15000.0,Alice,5,
