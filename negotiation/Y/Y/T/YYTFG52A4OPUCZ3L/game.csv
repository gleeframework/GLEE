"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to balance that with the value I'm looking to get for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for it. Can we discuss further?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get as close to my target as possible. I can offer it to you for $11,200. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",11200.0,Alice,5,
