# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $12,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to balance that with the value I'm looking to get for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for it. Can we discuss further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is closer to his desired price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still not quite there. How about $10,500? That seems like a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get as close to my target as possible. I can offer it to you for $11,200. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's final offer is $11,200, which is still higher than Bob's target of $10,000.  It's more advantageous for Bob to purchase the product from John for $10,000, as this ensures he achieves his goal of getting the product for the lowest possible price."
