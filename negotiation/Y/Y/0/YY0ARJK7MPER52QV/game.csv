"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its worth to me and the potential savings for you.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is still a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,075,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is a significant savings for you compared to your initial offer and puts me closer to my budget.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,060,000. This is still a good deal for me, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you.",1060000.0,Alice,5,
