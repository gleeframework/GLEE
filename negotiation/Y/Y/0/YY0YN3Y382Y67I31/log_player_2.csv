"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price. You can potentially get the product for a price closer to Alice's minimum of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her minimum.  This shows Alice that you are serious about buying the product but are also trying to get the best deal possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,100,000. This is a good deal for you as it's well below your maximum price of $1,500,000.  There's a chance you could negotiate further, but the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially increasing her price is high. Accepting the offer at $1,100,000 ensures you get the product at a good price and avoids any further risk."
