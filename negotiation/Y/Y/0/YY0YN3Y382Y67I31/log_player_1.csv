Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This gives us room to negotiate while still ensuring a substantial profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a decent profit, I believe I can get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,100,000. It's still a good profit for me, and it shows flexibility while demonstrating that I'm not willing to settle for Bob's initial low offer."
