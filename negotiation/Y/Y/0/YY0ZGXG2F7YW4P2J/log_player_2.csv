Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, I'll offer a price that's around 60% of the initial offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your perspective on the market, this product offers unique advantages that justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This reflects its true worth and potential for generating value.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer, this time aiming to get even closer to the $1,000,000 price point. Since Alice came down to $2,100,000 from $2,300,000, I'll try to get her to come down by another $100,000.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced that $2,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to the lower end of the spectrum. How about we discuss $1,950,000?"", ""product_price"": 1950000}"
