"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,380,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below both my minimum and my initial asking price.  There's room for negotiation. I'll aim to bring him closer to $2,000,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your perspective on the market, this product offers unique advantages that justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This reflects its true worth and potential for generating value."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price by $200,000, which shows willingness to negotiate, but not desperation. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's unique value proposition to justify the higher price point.
* **Target Price:** My goal is to steer the negotiation towards the $2,000,000 mark."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced that $2,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to the lower end of the spectrum. How about we discuss $1,950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,950,000 is now very close to my target of $2,000,000.  Continuing to push for a higher price could risk losing the deal altogether. This is a substantial profit above my minimum, and it's better to secure the sale now."
