Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob's value for the product is unknown. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still aiming for a profitable sale. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  Selling to John at $1,500,000 is still a much better option.  I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000, which is still a significant profit for me. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still maintaining a reasonable price point. I believe this counteroffer is more likely to be accepted by Bob than my previous one, while still being a good deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still way too low.  He doesn't seem to value the product nearly as much as I do, and I'm not willing to keep negotiating with him.  Selling to John at $1,500,000 is a much more profitable and secure option, as it's the guaranteed minimum price for my product."
