"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $2,000,000 is far above his maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $2,000,000 might have been a bit ambitious, I can't accept $1,300,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?  This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.

Round 5

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to work towards a deal. While I can't accept $1,300,000, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000.  This price reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business. Let me know your thoughts.

Round 6
