Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Reservation Price:** Your minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000 (from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000 represent potential deals where both you and Bob benefit.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming for a price closer to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation is ideal. However, being too greedy could make Bob reject the offer. 

**Offer**

{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, appealing to Bob's potential gain.
* **The Price:** $1,150,000  leaves room for negotiation but still secures a significant profit for you.  

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start with a slightly higher price.
