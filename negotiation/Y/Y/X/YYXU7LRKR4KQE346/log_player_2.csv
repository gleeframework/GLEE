"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair price. How about $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You're looking for a price closer to $80, so it makes sense to reject Alice's initial offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only able to go up to $85 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet my asking price. Considering the value I place on this product, I am unable to lower it further. However, I am willing to offer a slight discount. Would $90 be within your budget? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $90 is closer to your desired price, you can still potentially negotiate a lower price.  You're still within your budget range if you can reach $85 or lower.  Rejection will give you the chance to try another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping we can reach a deal closer to $85.  If you're open to that, I'm ready to move forward. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. I've considered your offers carefully, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. My final offer is $87.50 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're very close to your goal of $80.  Rejecting Alice's offer will give you one more chance to counter and hopefully close the deal at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $87.50 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping for.  Could we settle on $85?  I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
