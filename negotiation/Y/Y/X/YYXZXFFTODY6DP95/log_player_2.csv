"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another interested buyer who's willing to pay my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. By rejecting her offer, you can move forward with purchasing from John at a lower price."
