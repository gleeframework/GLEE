"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This reflects its worth while recognizing your interest.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, I'm afraid  $1,700,000 is still too high for me. I could go up to $1,100,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $1,550,000. This is my final offer.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
