Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but her ""final offer"" of $1,550,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000.  At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price. Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product within his budget."
