Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be highly valuable to your business.  I'm asking for $950,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** $950,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It's below Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, allowing for potential compromise. 
* **It shows confidence:** A high initial offer signals you believe in the product's value.

Remember, your goal is to maximize profit, but you also want to ensure a sale. Keep your fallback option (selling to John) in mind throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe it's a great product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what you initially offered. By rejecting his offer, you can try to push for a higher price.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for better deal:** You still have room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a price closer to your desired $950,000.
* **Avoid settling too early:** Accepting Bob's offer might result in you missing out on a more profitable deal. 
* **Maintain leverage:** Rejecting the offer shows you're not desperate to sell and gives you more control in the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

You should prepare a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's $850,000 but still below your initial $950,000. This strategy will keep the negotiation moving and might lead to a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $900,000? This price still reflects the value of the product, but gives you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate but are still holding firm on a price that reflects the product's value.
* **Middle ground:** $900,000 is a middle ground between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This makes it a reasonable and potentially acceptable price.
* **Reasoning:** You've shown flexibility without sacrificing too much. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while maximizing your potential profit. 

**Key takeaway:**

Continue to be flexible, but don't be afraid to hold firm on your desired price. Remember, your fallback option with John is always there if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $875,000. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $875,000 is still lower than you initially hoped for, it's a good compromise and a reasonable price given the current situation.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:**  $875,000 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Avoid further negotiations:** Continuing to negotiate could risk Bob walking away, leaving you with only the $800,000 offer from John.
* **Time is money:**  Accepting the offer means you can close the deal and avoid further negotiation, which takes time and effort.

**Key takeaway:**

Sometimes, it's wise to accept a reasonable offer and avoid potentially losing a sale altogether. In this scenario, $875,000 is a good profit and secures a sale without putting the entire deal at risk."
