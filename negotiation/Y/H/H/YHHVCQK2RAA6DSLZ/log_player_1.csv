"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation without immediately jeopardizing the deal.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it indicates he's interested and willing to negotiate. 
* **More rounds available:**  I have 9 rounds remaining to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Next Steps:** In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. Let's find a middle ground to make this work."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price slightly, but still maintaining a margin above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Reiterate Interest:** The message is polite and emphasizes my willingness to negotiate, indicating a potential deal is still possible.
* **Clear Price:** A specific counteroffer encourages Bob to consider a specific price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $11,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's closer than before, it's not yet a deal I can accept.
* **Negotiation leverage:** Bob is showing flexibility, which means I have room to negotiate further. I can counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Time remaining:** We still have six rounds left. I can continue to push for a higher price while still maintaining the possibility of selling to John if necessary.

**Next Steps:** In the next round, I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my desired price, aiming to find a midpoint."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Progress:** I'm offering a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's current offer. This shows I'm willing to meet halfway and signals a move towards a deal.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  The message emphasizes the fairness of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Maintaining Value:** $12,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's a more realistic target given the current negotiation.

**Next Steps:** I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer. If not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating, but will also be aware of the time remaining and the option to sell to John if a deal with Bob doesn't seem likely."
