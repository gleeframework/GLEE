Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think the product is worth less than that. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the quick sale, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I still think the product is overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $1,225,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value and secures a sale without risking further negotiation rounds."
