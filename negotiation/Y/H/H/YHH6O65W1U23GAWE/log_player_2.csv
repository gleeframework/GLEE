"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to Alice's minimum as possible. Offering $12,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it leaves some room for Alice to counter while still saving Bob a significant amount compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is better than John's price, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to Bob's goal. Rejecting the offer allows for another round of counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  $13,000 is a compromise that's still within Bob's budget and might be more appealing to Alice than her previous counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,800 is a reasonable compromise. It's lower than John's price and only slightly higher than Bob's last counteroffer.  At this point, continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price, and the risk of Alice walking away or Bob losing the product to another buyer is high. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product while saving a considerable amount compared to John's offer."
