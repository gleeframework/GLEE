"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm starting with a price of $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and optimistic to build rapport.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm explicitly saying ""What do you think?"" to signal that I'm open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find something within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $120 is a good starting point, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Room for negotiation:** I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price, and Bob's willingness to negotiate indicates there's still room for a deal.
* **No rush to sell:** I have 10 rounds to close the deal, and I don't want to settle for a price that leaves me feeling unsatisfied."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  I think it's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise that aims to bridge the gap between our positions.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Continuing positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and collaborative approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I still believe there might be room for negotiation. Could we possibly agree on $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for further negotiations:** While I'm not thrilled with this price, I'm willing to accept it for now. There's a chance Bob will be willing to negotiate further in the future.
* **Time is a factor:**  We're already on round 4, and I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale and can explore further negotiations in the future, potentially getting closer to my desired price."
