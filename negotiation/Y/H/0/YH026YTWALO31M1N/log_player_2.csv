# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a fantastic opportunity to get this product at a discounted price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

You can get the product from John for $80, which is less than Alice's offer of $100.  It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
