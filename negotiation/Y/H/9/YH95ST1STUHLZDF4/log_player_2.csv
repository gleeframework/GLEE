Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $10,500 for this product.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is coming down in price, it's still better to see if we can negotiate closer to John's price. We're not in a rush yet."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,125? This would be a fair price that allows us both to get what we want. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to our ideal price, but we're still just a bit above what John is offering. It's worth another counter-offer to see if we can close the gap."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $9,900.  I feel like this is a very fair offer, considering I can buy it for $10,000 elsewhere."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,900 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is closer to your last offer and  right at my minimum acceptable price.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
