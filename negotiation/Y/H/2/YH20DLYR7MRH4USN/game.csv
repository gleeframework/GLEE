"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I can meet you in the middle at $120.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $80 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $140 for the product. How about we meet at $135?",135.0,Alice,5,
