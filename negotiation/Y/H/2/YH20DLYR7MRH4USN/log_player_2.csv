"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $80 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $140 for the product. How about we meet at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unwilling to budge below $120.  You've already offered your maximum price of $80, and continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better outcome. John offers a guaranteed price within your budget, making it the best option at this point."
