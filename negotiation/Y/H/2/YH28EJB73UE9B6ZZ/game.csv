"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm very interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Let me see if I can meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, your offer is much closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! However, $750,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle at $1,000,000? This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
