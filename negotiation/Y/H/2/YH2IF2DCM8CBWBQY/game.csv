"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant amount, but I'm still willing to negotiate further. Considering the product's value and our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you.
