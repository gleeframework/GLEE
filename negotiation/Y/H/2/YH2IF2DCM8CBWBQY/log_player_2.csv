"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the market value of this product is $1200000. Considering our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's a good starting point, but you can likely get a better deal.  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so there's room for negotiation."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant amount, but I'm still willing to negotiate further. Considering the product's value and our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and $850,000 is a good compromise. You're saving a significant amount compared to John's price, and it's likely you won't get much lower with further negotiation."
