"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $105?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'd be happy to buy it at that price.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's fair to both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
