"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my profit.  However, I'm also aware that Bob values the product at $800,000, so I'm not going to go too far beyond that. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm confident that I can get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I still have 8 rounds left and don't want to settle too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price that is closer to my initial offer.  I believe that this price is fair considering Bob's valuation and my own needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. It matches my minimum acceptable price and I've already rejected a counteroffer. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and move on."
