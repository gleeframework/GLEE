Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $140. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $150, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120 (your guaranteed sale to John). 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 gives Bob a good deal (saving $10) while allowing you to make a $20 profit over your minimum. This price point aims to secure the deal with Bob, earning you more than selling to John."
