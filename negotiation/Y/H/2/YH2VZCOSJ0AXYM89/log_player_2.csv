"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay a maximum of $12,000, and Alice is asking for $11,500. This leaves very little room for negotiation.
* **There are 10 rounds.** You have plenty of time to try and negotiate a better price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net.** You can always choose to buy from John, but it's better to try and get a lower price if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of this product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to offer you $10,500 for it.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still giving you a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.**  While $11,000 is closer to your target, it's still above your ideal price point. 
* **There are 7 rounds left.**  You have time to continue negotiating. 
* **John's offer is still a safety net.** If you can't get a better price, you can always purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm comfortable going up to $10,750, which is a fair compromise. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your persistence. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,750 is still too low for me. How about we settle this at $10,900?  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer.** $10,900 is within your budget and a reasonable compromise.
* **It's Alice's ""final offer"".**  If you reject this, you risk Alice becoming less willing to negotiate further.
* **John's offer is a good backup.**  You're still saving money compared to buying from John. 

While you might be able to squeeze out a little more, accepting this offer minimizes the risk of the negotiation falling apart and allows you to secure the product at a price that's within your budget."
