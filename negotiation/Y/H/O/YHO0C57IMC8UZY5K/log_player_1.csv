"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

Bob's offer is too low. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $850,000?  That's still a great price for you, and it's a fair compromise for me.  Let's keep this deal moving forward!"", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm not going to settle for $780,000 just yet.  John is still an option if I can't get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to counter again and see if I can get closer to my target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your point, but $780,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. Let's split the difference.  How about $815,000? That's a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 815000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'd prefer to get a bit more from Bob, we're getting close to the end of the rounds. I'm not confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale altogether.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price that's acceptable to me."
