"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $175 for it.",175.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $125. Can you consider that?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $150? That's still a good deal for you, and it's fair for me.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I understand that $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $130. Can you consider that?,130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $130 is still too far off from what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $140. That's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $140. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $135. Can you consider that?",135.0,Bob,6,
