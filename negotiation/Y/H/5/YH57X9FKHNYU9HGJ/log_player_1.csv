Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in.  My asking price is $140, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's close to what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Openness:**  I'm emphasizing my willingness to negotiate to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm suggesting the product is of value to Bob, which might incentivize him to make a deal. 

**Strategy:** 

This strategy aims to maximize my profits while keeping the negotiation open. By starting high but leaving room for compromise, I can potentially secure a price closer to $150. If Bob rejects the offer, I can then assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Even though Bob rejected my initial offer, he's still interested. This suggests a possibility of reaching a mutually agreeable price through further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to $120 or $130 to see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! While I appreciate your offer, $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($120) and his initial offer ($110). This demonstrates my willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of his interest in the product and suggesting that $125 is still a fair price given its value to him.
* **Keeping the negotiation open:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion to encourage further dialogue and potentially reach a deal.

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise, I'm aiming to find a price that both Bob and I are comfortable with. This counteroffer is strategically designed to encourage Bob to accept and move towards a final agreement."
