This is a good time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're buying the product for $9,750, saving $5,250 compared to John's offer.
* **Time Value:**  You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. Continuing might yield a slightly better price, but the time and effort might not be worth the marginal gain.
* **Alice's Limit:**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer. Pushing further might make her less willing to negotiate."
