"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $150, which is what I believe is fair for this product. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $165. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $165 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to get this product for $155.  It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're close, Bob. I can see you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to come down to $160, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my offer of $155.  I know you want to make a profit, and I'm happy to pay a fair price. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",155.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $160, Bob. I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal - I'll include a free accessory that's worth $20. That brings the total value to $180, but I'll sell it to you for $170. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,7,
