"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $800000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid $600000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the product's unique features and my initial offer of $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $700000. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $700000. How about we meet at $650000? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I have a budget in mind.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $650000. Considering our previous offers, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and counteroffer at $675000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $675000. I'm willing to meet you at $680000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I might be able to find a better deal elsewhere.",680000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go up to $680000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment and counteroffer at $690000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",690000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $690000. I'm willing to meet you at $680000, but I'm not going any higher. I'm starting to think that I might need to explore other options.",680000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're hesitant, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to $680000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment and counteroffer at $695000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $695000. I'm willing to meet you at $690000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options, including buying from John for $1200000.",690000.0,Bob,10,
