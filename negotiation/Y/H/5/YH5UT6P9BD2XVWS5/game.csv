"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value. Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,
