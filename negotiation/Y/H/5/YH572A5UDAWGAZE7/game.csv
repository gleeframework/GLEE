"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
