"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 12000} 

I'm starting high, but I'm also leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum value as possible, but I also want to avoid pushing Bob away entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to try to counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is still significantly lower than my ideal price, but it's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, Bob sees this as a step in the right direction and we can reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is unwilling to budge on his offer, and I've already made a significant compromise.  While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and avoids further negotiation."
