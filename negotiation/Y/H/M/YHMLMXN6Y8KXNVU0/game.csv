"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product and the value you place on it.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $12,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is a fair price that takes into account the value I place on the product and the value you place on it.",13500.0,Alice,5,
