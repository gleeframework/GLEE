Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a starting point for negotiation. I'm offering a price that is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but lower than what I would ideally like to get.  This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.  If Bob rejects, I can then adjust my counter-offer based on his response and whether I feel it's more advantageous to continue negotiating with him or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price, as there's still room for me to improve on his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer by $100,000 from the previous round. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but still maintain a fair price for my product.  I believe this is a reasonable offer that reflects the value of the product and is closer to what Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum price point, and the negotiation is taking longer than I anticipated. It's not ideal, but to avoid the risk of losing Bob altogether and potentially having to start over with a new buyer, I'm willing to accept this offer."
