"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than John's offer of $8,000.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can save $4,000 by purchasing from John. 

Even though Alice believes it's a good deal, it makes more financial sense for you to go with John's offer."
