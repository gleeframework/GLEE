"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000.
