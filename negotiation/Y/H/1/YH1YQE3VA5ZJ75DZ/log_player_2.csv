"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $140 is still higher than your maximum budget of $120.
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $120. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you keep the door open for a potentially better offer from her, or you can proceed with buying from John and save $20."
