"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $200 is my starting point, I could come down to $170.  That's a significant discount and I think reflects the value of the product.  What do you say?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $170 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $110? I feel like that's a fair price.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to be fair to myself too.  How about this:  $140 and we have a deal.  That's my final offer.",140.0,Alice,5,
