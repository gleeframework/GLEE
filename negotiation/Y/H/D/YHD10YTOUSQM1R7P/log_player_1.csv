Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $120. Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary. It also sets the stage for a potential counteroffer from Bob, giving me more leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in buying the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than my minimum of $100, it's still below my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for $90.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get him up to my desired price.  It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John and move on."
