"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my research and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This offer reflects a substantial investment on my part and would be a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm confident it's worth a premium, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects a more moderate position while still acknowledging the true value of what's being offered.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident that $900,000 is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us.  This offer is a significant investment for me, and I'm hoping we can find common ground here.",900000.0,Bob,4,
