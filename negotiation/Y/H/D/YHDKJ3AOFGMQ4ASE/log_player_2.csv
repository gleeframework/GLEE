"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll take advantage of it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

You should reject Alice's offer.  It's still more than you want to pay, and you have the option to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $87.50. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

You should accept Alice's offer. It's a good price, and you're still saving some money compared to buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee you'll get a lower price, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
