Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a sale. 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This means he's willing to pay up to that amount. 
* **My Minimum:** My minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000 (John's offer).
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's $200,000 of potential profit to split between Bob and me. Offering $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 ""discount"" and me a $150,000 profit above my minimum.

This offer:

* **Increases my likelihood of a sale:** Bob is more likely to accept a price that's significantly lower than his maximum value.
* **Gives me a good profit:**  $150,000 is a substantial gain over my minimum."
