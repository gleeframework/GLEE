{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially since you have a solid alternative with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000, which is my maximum price. This sets a clear limit and shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but at a price I'm comfortable with. This counteroffer also aligns with the price John is offering, giving me a strong fallback option if Alice rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is still too high. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still significantly more than what I'm willing to pay and what John is offering. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,200,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still not going to pay her full asking price. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be attractive enough for her to accept, but I'm still comfortable walking away and buying from John if she doesn't."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my target price, it's still $550,000 more than what John is offering. I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $1,300,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to pay more, but I'm still holding firm to a price that's within my budget and is closer to John's offer. It's a reasonable compromise that could potentially lead to an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. While she's coming down in price, the difference between her offer and John's price is still significant. I'm confident that I can continue negotiating and get a better deal, or at least get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $1,350,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's within my budget.  I'm hoping this small increase will be enough to entice Alice to accept, especially given her previous counteroffer of $1,475,000. If she rejects this offer, I'm prepared to accept John's offer as a backup plan."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. The negotiation has gone on for a while, and the price difference between her offer and John's offer is still significant. At this point, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that Alice will come down to a price I'm comfortable with. To avoid further delays and ensure I get the product within my budget, I'll accept John's offer."
