""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($800,000) as possible, while staying above our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for some negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a safety net with John, ensuring we won't be forced to accept anything below our minimum.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiating style or financial limits. If we had more information, we could tailor our offer for a potentially better outcome."
