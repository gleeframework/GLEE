"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming to stay within my budget, and I'm ready to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it would allow me to purchase it without exceeding my limit.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm happy to make a counteroffer. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,200. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective and appreciate you coming down a bit. While $9,200 is getting closer, it's still a little higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go to $8,800. This would be a great price for both of us, allowing you to still make a decent profit while helping me stay within my limit. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",8800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about staying within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. After reconsidering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000, which is the same price I initially offered. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
