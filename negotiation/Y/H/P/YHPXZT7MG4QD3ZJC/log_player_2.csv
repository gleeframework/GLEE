"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than Alice's offer, I'm leaving room for negotiation and gauging her willingness to come down in price.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is essential for a successful negotiation. 
* **Target Price in Mind:** My goal is to get the product as close to my maximum price ($8,000) as possible, but starting low gives me room to maneuver."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $8,500 is closer to my budget, it's still above what John is offering. I'm willing to negotiate a little further to see if I can get closer to my target price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $7,250?"", 
""product_price"": 7250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Suggesting the midpoint between my last offer ($6,000) and Alice's counteroffer ($8,500) demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still working towards a favorable price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer keeps me in a strong negotiating position. It's a significant jump from my previous offer, showing Alice I'm serious, but it's still a good deal below her current price and my maximum budget."
