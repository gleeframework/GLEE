Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  There's a good chance Bob can negotiate a better price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make on this sale.  What do you say?
