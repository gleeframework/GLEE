"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, and closer to my reserve price than my initial offer.  It's in my best interest to see if I can negotiate further.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations at that price."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
