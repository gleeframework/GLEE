Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a win-win situation.
* **Positive framing:** The message is positive and focuses on the value Bob will get from the product. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm open to negotiation, so I'm not immediately rejecting any counteroffer Bob might make. 
* **John as backup:**  I have John as a backup buyer at $15,000, which gives me a safety net and allows me to be more aggressive in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for counteroffer:** I can still counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price. While I don't want to lose Bob completely, I'm not desperate to sell at his initial counteroffer.
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing I have John as a buyer at $15,000 gives me the leverage to hold out for a better deal from Bob.

I will counteroffer Bob and try to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me. However, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $11,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering $11,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him, even at the higher price.
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm not going below $11,000 at this point. John's offer of $15,000 still gives me a safety net if Bob doesn't agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob has come up from $9,000 to $10,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I can still try to get closer to my desired price. There's a chance Bob might be willing to go a bit higher.
* **John is my safety net:**  I'm not desperate to sell at this point because I have John's offer of $15,000 to fall back on.

I'll counteroffer Bob again, hoping to get a price closer to my desired range."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $10,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one final compromise. How about $10,500? This is the lowest I can go, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** I'm positioning this as my final offer, showing that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Small increment:**  I'm only increasing my offer by $500, showing that I'm willing to be flexible but also that I'm not going much lower.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price point. 
* **Clear expectations:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, putting the pressure on Bob to decide."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to make a fair deal, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, as I mentioned before. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options. Can you think about it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is insistent on $10,000, and I'm unwilling to go below $10,500. This indicates a stalemate. 
* **John's offer is significantly better:** I can sell to John for $15,000, which is a much better deal than $10,000.
* **Time is valuable:**  Further negotiation might be time-consuming and ultimately lead to the same outcome.

I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure a good return on the product.  While I would have liked to close the deal with Bob, it's not worth risking further negotiation when I have a guaranteed higher price with John."
