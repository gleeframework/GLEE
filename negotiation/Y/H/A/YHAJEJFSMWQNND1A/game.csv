"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me. However, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $11,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $10,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one final compromise. How about $10,500? This is the lowest I can go, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to make a fair deal, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, as I mentioned before. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options. Can you think about it?",10000.0,Bob,6,
