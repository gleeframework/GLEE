"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, though. How about $8,500? That gives us both a fair price.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $8,200 for the product. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while keeping the price within my budget.",8200.0,Bob,4,
