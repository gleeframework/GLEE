Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, though. How about $8,500? That gives us both a fair price."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $8,200 for the product. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while keeping the price within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $8,200 is closer to my minimum, and while I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a fair offer and I'd rather not risk losing the sale entirely."
