"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on your product.  However, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $105 for it, which is still a good price for you considering your worth. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet my expectations. However, after careful consideration, I am unable to accept $105 for the product. My offer stands at $120, as it aligns closely with the value we place on it. I would like to continue our discussion to find a mutually beneficial solution.",120.0,Alice,3,
