Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on your product.  However, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $105 for it, which is still a good price for you considering your worth. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
