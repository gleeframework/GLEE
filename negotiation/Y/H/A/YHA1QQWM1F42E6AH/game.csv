"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your initial price. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value is worth more than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1000000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm confident that you'll see the value in this investment.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still believe the product's value is worth more than $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $950000. I'm confident that this price reflects the product's true value and is a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the $950000 price tag. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. I think this is a more reasonable price, considering the market value and my budget.",920000.0,Bob,6,
