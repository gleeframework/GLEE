"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your generosity, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still feel that $15,000 is too high for my budget. I would like to propose $13,000 as a compromise. This would allow us to reach an agreement within my financial limits while still providing a reasonable return for you. I hope you can consider this proposal.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $13,000 is cutting it too close. How about we settle at $14,000? This is my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offers. I understand that $14,000 might be too high for my budget. I would like to propose $13,500 as a compromise. This would allow us to reach an agreement closer to my financial limits while still providing a reasonable return for you. I hope you can accept this proposal.",13500.0,Bob,6,
