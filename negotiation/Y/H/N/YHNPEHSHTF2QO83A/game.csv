"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10000 is simply too low for me.  I'm happy to meet in the middle. How about $12000? This gives you a great price while still allowing me to get a fair return on my product. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,
