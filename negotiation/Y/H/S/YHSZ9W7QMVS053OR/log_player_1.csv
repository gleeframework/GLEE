It's time to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Profitable Price:** $970,000 is significantly more than John's offer of $800,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob is increasing his offer in smaller increments, suggesting we're getting closer to his limit. 
* **Time Constraint:** We're over halfway through the negotiation rounds. Holding out for a slightly better offer from Bob risks him walking away or our potential profit shrinking."
