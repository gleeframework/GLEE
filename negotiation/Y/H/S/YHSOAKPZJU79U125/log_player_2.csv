"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, that price is a little high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However,  $850,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $825,000. I'm confident that the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm now offering the product to you for $825,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $825,000, and it's becoming clear that her ideal price point is too far from yours. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a price higher than John's offer."
