"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to discuss."",
 ""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,100,000 vs. $800,000) sets a strong anchor.  Even if Bob doesn't accept this price, it frames the negotiation in a higher range.
* **Room to Negotiate:**  While we value the product at $1,200,000, offering it at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price above Bob's valuation.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's ""exceptional value"" and suggesting a ""fair starting point"" to encourage a collaborative negotiation. 

This approach aims to maximize our earnings while keeping Bob engaged in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). While his counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate, accepting now would mean a substantial loss.  We have room to negotiate further and try to bring him closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is unfortunately below its true worth. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,050,000.  This reflects the product's exceptional quality while acknowledging your initial offer."",
 ""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and express understanding to maintain a positive negotiation environment. 
* **Strategic Concession:** We decrease our price by $50,000, demonstrating a willingness to move towards a deal. However, the concession is calculated; it keeps us well above Bob's offer and closer to our target.
* **Value Emphasis:** We reiterate the product's value to justify the higher price and potentially shift Bob's perception of its worth. 

We aim to signal flexibility while holding onto a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, $950,000 is still significantly less than our minimum of $1,200,000 and John's standing offer. We need to signal that we're willing to walk away if a reasonable price isn't reached.  We'll make one more counteroffer, but we'll be prepared to sell to John if Bob doesn't significantly increase his bid."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, to be transparent, $950,000 is below the product's true value and represents a significant discount for me. My final offer is $1,025,000. I believe this reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your position.  If we can't agree on this, I'll need to explore other options."",
 ""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** We clearly state this is our ""final offer,"" conveying a sense of urgency and limited flexibility.
* **Transparency:**  By mentioning it's a ""significant discount,"" we highlight the concession we're making and emphasize the value we're offering.
* **Alternative Option:** We subtly introduce the idea of selling to John (""explore other options"") without directly threatening Bob, preserving the negotiation relationship.

This offer creates a clear decision point for Bob. It gives him a final chance to secure the product at a price significantly lower than our initial ask, but also implies we're prepared to walk away if he doesn't agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but $1,025,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $975,000, while higher than his previous offers, is still significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  More importantly, his incremental increases suggest he's unlikely to meet our valuation. 

We've given him multiple opportunities to make a reasonable offer. At this point, continuing to negotiate risks losing the guaranteed offer from John.  Selling to John ensures we receive our minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further unsuccessful negotiation rounds with Bob."
