"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $10000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14000? This is still a great price for you and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit above my budget with your offer of $14000. How about we meet at $12000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.,12000.0,Bob,4,
