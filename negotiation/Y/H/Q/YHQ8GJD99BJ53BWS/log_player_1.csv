Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

$10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This is still a great price for you and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
