"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $9,800 is still below my minimum.  Would you be willing to go up to $10,000?  It's a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied.",10000.0,Alice,5,
