"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its true value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives you a good return as well.  Let's start the negotiation with this offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves room for a good profit for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This offer is closer to your last offer and shows my commitment to reaching a deal.  What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,025,000. This would be a fair compromise that would allow both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $1,025,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal and avoid any further negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
