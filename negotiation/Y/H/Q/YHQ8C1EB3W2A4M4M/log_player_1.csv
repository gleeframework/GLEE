"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives you a good return as well.  Let's start the negotiation with this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a decent amount, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  We still have several rounds left, and I'll counter with a price that's more suitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves room for a good profit for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This offer is closer to your last offer and shows my commitment to reaching a deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While he's getting closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still a bit too low. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price, and I want to explore that option further.  We have several rounds left, and I'll counter with a price that I believe is fair."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,025,000. This would be a fair compromise that would allow both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $1,025,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal and avoid any further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the same as what John is offering.  While I'd prefer to have gotten a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me the $1,000,000 I need and avoids any further negotiation."
