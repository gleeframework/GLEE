"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85? This still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $80. Let's make this deal happen!",80.0,Alice,5,
