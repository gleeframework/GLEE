"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  Since you have a backup option with John, there's no reason to accept an offer higher than your maximum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within your acceptable range. This signals your desire for a good deal and leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is now at your maximum price. It's wise to accept this offer, as you can get the product for the same price as John's. You've successfully negotiated a better deal than the initial offer, and there's no reason to risk losing the opportunity by continuing to negotiate."
