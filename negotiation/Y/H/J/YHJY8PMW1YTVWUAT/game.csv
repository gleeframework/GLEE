"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below my asking price but still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is my best and final offer for now, but I'm still interested in the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your offer. While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm not quite ready to accept that price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still leaves you a substantial profit while allowing me to earn closer to my desired value. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm open to further discussion if needed. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This is my best and final offer for now.",950000.0,Bob,4,
