Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below my asking price but still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly below your asking price:** This shows Bob you're serious about selling to him and willing to negotiate.
* **It leaves Bob with a healthy profit margin:** This incentivizes him to accept the offer.
* **It's not too low:** You still have room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer. 

Remember, you can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail. But starting with a reasonable offer that benefits both parties is the best strategy to maximize your earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is my best and final offer for now, but I'm still interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly less than what you could get from John. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your offer. While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm not quite ready to accept that price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still leaves you a substantial profit while allowing me to earn closer to my desired value. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm open to further discussion if needed. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're willing to negotiate but not sacrificing too much.
* **Provides a reasonable compromise:** $1,000,000 is closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial price.
* **Focuses on mutual benefit:** You highlight how the price benefits both parties.

This strategy aims to keep Bob engaged while maintaining a fair profit for you. Remember, you can always sell to John if you feel Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This is my best and final offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still not worth risking the opportunity to sell to John for $1,500,000.  Bob has shown a reluctance to move much further, and continuing to negotiate with him risks losing both deals. Selling to John ensures you maximize your profit."
