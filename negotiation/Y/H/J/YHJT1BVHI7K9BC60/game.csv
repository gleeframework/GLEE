"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product,  $13,000 is beyond my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  I believe this offer represents a fair compromise. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  I'm willing to drop the price to $10,000, but that's my absolute lowest.  It's a very fair price for a product of this quality.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
