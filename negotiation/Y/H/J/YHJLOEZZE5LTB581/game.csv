"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a little high. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to settle a bit lower. How about we agree on $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
