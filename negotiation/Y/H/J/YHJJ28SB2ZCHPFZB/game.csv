"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price is fair considering its value to you.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $900,000 is significantly below what I'm aiming for.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000.  This price still allows you to make a good profit, and it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. How about we settle at $975,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints. How about we split the difference this time?  $1,012,500.  It's a fair price for both of us.  If we can come to an agreement, it will save us both time and effort.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very accommodating, and I appreciate that. How about we try to finalize this now? I'm willing to go up to $990,000.  That's a significant move on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",990000.0,Bob,6,
