{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts by acknowledging Bob's potential interest and then presents a price that is slightly above his perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $125 is a better offer than Bob's initial assessment, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $132.50? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 132.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $130 is a bit steep. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $130 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable going below my minimum. John is offering a guaranteed $150, which is a better outcome for me at this point."
