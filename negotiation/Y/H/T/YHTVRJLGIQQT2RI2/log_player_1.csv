{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer starts at a high price, but it's still below my minimum acceptable value. It gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to go for the quick sale, I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great price for a product worth $1,000,000 to me. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the maximum value the product is worth to him. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and gets me close to my minimum acceptable value. While I'd prefer more, it's better than risking a prolonged negotiation or selling to John for a lower profit."
