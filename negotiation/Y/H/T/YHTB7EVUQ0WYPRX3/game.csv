"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $8,500?  It's still a good deal for you and closer to what I need.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $8,250. This is a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,5,
