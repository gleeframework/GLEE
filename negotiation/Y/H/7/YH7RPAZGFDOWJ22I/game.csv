"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8200. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
