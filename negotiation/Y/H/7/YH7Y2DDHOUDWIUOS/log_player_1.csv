Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, I can afford to start high. Aiming for nearly double the value allows room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  While I haven't explicitly stated the product's value to Bob, mentioning ""its value"" hints that I'm aware it's desirable. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone is friendly and uses phrases like ""What do you think?"" which suggests I'm willing to discuss the price. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize profit:**  If Bob accepts, I get a great deal.
2. **Gauge Bob's interest:** His response will indicate how much he's willing to pay, allowing me to adjust if needed.
3. **No risk:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can sell to John at my minimum acceptable price."
