{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $10,000 is still significantly less than the $12,000 Bob values the product at, giving him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** By starting at $10,000, you have the potential to negotiate higher if Bob is willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is a decent offer, it's still a bit below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to get a bit closer to $10,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
