# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium.
