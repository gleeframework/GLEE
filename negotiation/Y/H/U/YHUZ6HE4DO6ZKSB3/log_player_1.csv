""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $14,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While $12,000 is a good chunk above my minimum, I know it's worth more to Bob. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.
