"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm asking for $2,300,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but my original asking price reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't go as low as $800,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still above my limit.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. While $1,200,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a substantial difference from what I had in mind. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is my final offer, as I have other potential buyers interested at a higher price point.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I respect your position,  $1,650,000 is still more than I can reasonably afford at this time.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This offer demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
