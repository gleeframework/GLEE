I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,000 is still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get more, $10,000 is a good price and  I'm worried I'll lose out if I keep pushing and he decides to walk away."
