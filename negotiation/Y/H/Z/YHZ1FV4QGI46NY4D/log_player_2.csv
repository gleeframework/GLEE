"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even better price.  Since Bob has a fallback option of buying from John for $1,500,000, he has leverage to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He knows the product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to him, and Alice's initial offer was $1,200,000.  This counteroffer at $1,000,000 is a significant drop, showcasing Bob's willingness to negotiate and potentially pushing Alice to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price of $1,200,000 to $1,100,000.  This is a good compromise and puts the price closer to Bob's target. While further negotiation is possible,  accepting this offer is a good balance between saving money and avoiding the risk of losing the product to John."
