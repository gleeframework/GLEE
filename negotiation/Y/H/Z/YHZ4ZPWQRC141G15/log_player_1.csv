""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth.  Please let me know your decision at your earliest convenience."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 creates a substantial profit margin while still being significantly below Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting.
* **Time Value of Money:**  A quicker sale to Bob, even at a slightly lower price, might be preferable to waiting for the guaranteed sale to John.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a sale."
