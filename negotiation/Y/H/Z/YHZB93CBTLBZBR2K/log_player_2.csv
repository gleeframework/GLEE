"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $14,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Option 1:**  Accepting the offer means exceeding Bob's budget. 
* **Option 2:**  Rejecting allows for negotiation and potentially a better price.
* **Option 3:** Buying from John is only a last resort, as it's at Bob's max budget.

By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $14,000 is too high for Bob.
* **Counteroffer:** $13,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's below Bob's maximum budget and leaves room for potential compromise. 
* **Strategic thinking:** By offering a lower price, Bob signals his willingness to negotiate while still leaving a margin for profit for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $13,500 is within Bob's budget and a good compromise.
* **Option 1:** Accepting the offer secures the product at a price lower than John's.
* **Option 2:** Rejecting and counteroffering may lead to further negotiations, but there's no guarantee of a better price.
* **Option 3:** Buying from John is unnecessary as Alice's offer is already within Bob's budget.

By accepting, Bob gets the product at a decent price and avoids further negotiation risk."
