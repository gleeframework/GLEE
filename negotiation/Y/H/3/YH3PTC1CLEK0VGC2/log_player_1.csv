Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $160. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is the maximum he's willing to pay and matches what John is offering.  There's no benefit to further negotiation with Bob."
