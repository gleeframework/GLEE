Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000.  This is a bold move, but it's important to set a high initial price to establish a strong negotiating position.  It's likely Bob will counteroffer, and we can then negotiate from there. If he rejects outright, I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, but I'm still holding out for something closer to $1,000,000. I'll counter with a price closer to that, leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $950,000.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial ask.  This gives us a good starting point for the next round of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would ideally like to get closer to $950,000, Bob's offer of $920,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000, and it seems like we're nearing an agreement.  It's time to accept and secure the deal."
