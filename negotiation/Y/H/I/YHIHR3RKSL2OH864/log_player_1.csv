"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,400,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for myself.  I'm confident Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is still a good price, but I want to see if I can get closer to my target. I'm confident I can get a better price if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a substantial profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a good deal.  I've already been through a few rounds of negotiation and it's likely I won't get a much better offer from Bob.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would mean a much lower profit, so accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this point."
