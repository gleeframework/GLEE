Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $130, which is above Bob's value but still below my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate down.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm asking for his opinion, making it clear I'm open to some negotiation. 

This strategy balances maximizing my profit with keeping the negotiation open and potentially achieving a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $130 is a bit high. Would you be willing to consider $100 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:** Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.  
* **John's Offer:**  While John is a guaranteed sale at $150, I want to see if I can get closer to that with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I go down to $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my minimum but still below John's offer.
* **Compromise:** I'm framing this as a compromise, emphasizing a fair price for both of us. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $115 is still above my minimum of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob pushes further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $115 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $105 is closer to my minimum of $150, it's still below my target.  
* **Counter Offer Potential:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a final counteroffer. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before accepting or going to John.
* **John's Offer:** John offers a significantly higher price. However, I'm still hoping to get closer to that amount by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you, but $105 is still a bit too low. To make this work, I'd need to go down to $110. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** This is likely my final counteroffer as it's very close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Compromise Again:** I'm presenting it as a compromise, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Clear Decision Point:** This gives Bob a clear choice - accept my final offer or walk away.  

I'm trying to strike a balance between getting a good price and potentially losing Bob entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Would you be willing to go down to $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Close to Minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $107.50 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my target price. 
* **Potential for Stalemate:** Further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or an endless loop of offers and counteroffers. 
* **John's Offer is Guaranteed:**  John offers a much better price, and there's no risk of further negotiation or rejection. It's a guaranteed sale and the most profitable option.

By selling to John, I secure a higher price and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob."
