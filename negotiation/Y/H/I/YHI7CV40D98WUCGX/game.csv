"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $1,150,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a bit lower.  Would you consider $1,075,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
