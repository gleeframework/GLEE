**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking to lowball offers.  He knows the product is worth $120 to him and is likely hoping I'll cave. Since I have a guaranteed offer of $80 from John, it's more profitable to cut my losses and move on.  There's no guarantee Bob will go any higher, and I risk wasting more time and potentially getting even less in later rounds."
