You should reject Alice's offer.  $1,800,000 is way above your budget. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. We can see how Alice responds and adjust from there."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

While Alice's offer is lower, it's still above your budget. You should reject and counter-offer again to see if you can reach a more agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer to $1,150,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still within my budget.  We'll see if this is closer to what Alice is willing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

Alice is not budging much and her offer is still too high. At this point, it's best to buy from John and save yourself further negotiation.  You're still getting a product you want for a price you can afford."
