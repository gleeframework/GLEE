Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a chance to own this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a substantial discount given its true worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Is there any flexibility on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is below my minimum price, and I believe I can get a better deal. It's important to remember that I have John as a backup buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,400,000 is significantly below the value I place on this product. To show my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it reflects the true value of this opportunity. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1600000 is still a bit high. I'd like to propose a price of $1500000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is exactly what John is willing to pay.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee of a better outcome, and it's risky to keep going.  Selling to John secures my minimum price and ensures a quick sale."
