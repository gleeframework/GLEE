"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your offer, the product's worth to me is considerably higher.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is valuable to you, but $1,750,000 is still more than I can realistically pay. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to your expectations.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
