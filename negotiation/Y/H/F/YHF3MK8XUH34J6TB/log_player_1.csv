Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a significant profit.  It's important to leave room for negotiation, as I don't know Bob's true valuation of the product.  If he rejects, we can see where he lands and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, it's below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable value.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject his offer and try one more counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will either get him to my desired price or convince him to walk away, allowing me to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm offering a price of $1,550,000. It's a compromise, but it's still a good profit for me.  If Bob rejects, I'll sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's clear that Bob isn't willing to meet me at my minimum acceptable value. It's time to move on.  John is a guaranteed sale at my desired price."
