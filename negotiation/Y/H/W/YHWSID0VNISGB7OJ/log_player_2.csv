**Reasoning:** 

Alice is not budging significantly on her price.  While she might eventually come down a little more, it's unlikely she'll reach a price close enough to John's $800,000 offer to be worth the risk of continued negotiation.  At this point, it's more strategic to cut your losses and secure the product from John at the guaranteed lower price."
