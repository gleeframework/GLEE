"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** The price is also within a reasonable range for Bob, considering he values the product at $80. This makes it more likely he'll counteroffer rather than immediately reject.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging message to create a positive negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering.  $110 is a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $65 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it indicates he's interested in the product.  There's potential for a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.
* **Selling to John is a safe option:** However, I'm keeping the option of selling to John open as a backup, ensuring I don't get stuck with a deal that's too unfavorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price closer to the middle ground between my minimum and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Keeping Room for Negotiation:** While $90 is closer to my desired price, it still leaves room for potential counteroffers from Bob without completely cutting off the negotiation. 
* **Positive and Reassuring Tone:**  The message is polite and reaffirms my interest in selling to Bob, keeping the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 6 rounds left, the time pressure is increasing. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept a price that significantly undervalues the product. 
* **Negotiating Further:** I believe there's still room for a better offer from Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John Remains an Option:**  Selling to John for $100 remains a viable option if negotiations with Bob continue to stall."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's close this now!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer represents a significant compromise from my initial asking price, but it's still above my minimum. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 5 rounds left, it's important to show a willingness to reach a deal.
* **Urgency:** The message uses a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept the offer and close the deal.
* **Emphasize Value:** The message reiterates the product's value to reinforce the fairness of the price.
* **John Still an Option:** Selling to John remains a viable option if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm on a tight budget.  How about $78? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $78 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than that.
* **Time Pressure is High:** With only 4 rounds left, the pressure is mounting. However, I'm not going to rush into a deal that undervalues my product.
* **Testing the Waters:** Bob's ""final offer"" might just be a negotiating tactic. I'll counteroffer again to see if he's truly serious.
* **John's offer is a backup:** Selling to John for $100 remains a secure option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $81. This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to go with another buyer. "", ""product_price"": 81}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm making a small concession to $81, which is still above my minimum.  This shows a commitment to finding a solution while protecting my interests.
* **Strong Closing:**  The message clearly states this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to accept or reject.
* **Emphasize the Alternative:**  The message reminds Bob that selling to John is a real possibility if we don't reach an agreement, adding pressure to accept the offer.
* **Limited Time:** With only 3 rounds left, time is running out. This offer is a last chance for Bob to make a deal."
