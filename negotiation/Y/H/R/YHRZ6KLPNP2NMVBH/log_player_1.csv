"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $17,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price, allowing space for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $17,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **More negotiation is needed.**  While Bob has shown some willingness to compromise, there's still room for us to meet in the middle. 
* **Selling to John is always an option.**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage and ensures I won't be forced to accept an unfavorable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to lower my price to $15,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm making a counter-offer to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Compromise:**  $15,500 is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I reiterate the value the product holds for Bob to justify my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $15,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  $14,000 is closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **More negotiation needed.** There's still room for us to find a mutually agreeable price, and I'm not in a rush to sell.
* **John's offer is a safety net.** Having John's offer ensures I don't have to settle for a price below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your willingness to go up to $14,000, I'm still a bit away from my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $14,500.  It's a fair price for both of us and reflects the value you'll get from the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price, but still staying above my minimum. 
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I'm framing this offer as a fair compromise that benefits both parties.
* **Highlighting value again:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to strengthen my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $14,500 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,250. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not enough.**  While $14,250 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate risks me dropping too low and losing out on potential profit.
* **John's offer is a safer bet.**  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, selling to him ensures I get my desired price.  There's no guarantee Bob will meet my minimum, and continuing to negotiate with him is risky."
