Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000.  I know it's valuable to you and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment at this price."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you insight into his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You can gradually lower your asking price, but never go below your minimum of $8,000."
