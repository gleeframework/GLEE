# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

You can do better than $120.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially get a lower price."

You can still do better than $100. Keep negotiating to see if you can get closer to your target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I really need to make a bit more profit on this sale. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $92? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer of $92 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with. You can get the product for $80 from John, so it makes more sense to go with the guaranteed lower price."
