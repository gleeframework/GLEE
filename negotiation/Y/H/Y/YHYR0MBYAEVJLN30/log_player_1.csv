Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am hoping to keep my spending within a budget of $80. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to sell the product for $80, I believe I can potentially get closer to my target price if I continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to stay within your budget. I understand your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  How about $85? This price still offers you a great deal, considering the value of the product. "", ""product_price"": 85}
