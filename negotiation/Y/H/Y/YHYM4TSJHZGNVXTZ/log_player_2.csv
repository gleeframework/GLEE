"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a steal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price. There are more rounds to negotiate and you have the option of buying from John as a backup.  You should try to get a better price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. It's a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $950000?  This way, we both get a good deal and I can move on to other opportunities. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still asking for a price higher than your target.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John. There's still room to get a better deal from Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a good compromise and allows us to finalize the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
