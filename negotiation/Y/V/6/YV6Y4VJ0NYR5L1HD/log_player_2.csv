Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, reducing the price by 10%. 
* This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and am willing to walk away if the price isn't right.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved slightly closer to my counteroffer, but there's still room for improvement.

* It's still worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my counteroffer by a smaller amount this time ($25,000), showing that I'm willing to compromise while still pushing for a better price.
* This  demonstrates that I'm taking Alice's offer seriously and am willing to meet halfway, but not at the expense of a significantly lower price. 
* It creates a sense of urgency, prompting Alice to potentially accept my counteroffer or offer a price closer to mine."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. 
* Accepting this offer saves me a substantial amount of money compared to buying from John.
*  We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, and continuing to push for a lower price risks losing the deal entirely.
*  It's a good compromise and a reasonable price considering the value of the product to Alice."
