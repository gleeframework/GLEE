Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for a higher price than your $10,000 minimum. 
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** There's room for negotiation and a potential compromise.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  You're stating your price and inviting Bob to respond. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
