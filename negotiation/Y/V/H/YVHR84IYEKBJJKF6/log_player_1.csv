Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I believe a starting price of $19,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 19000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $19,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $12,000 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $15,500? This product truly offers exceptional value at that price."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $15,500 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. Let's see if we can close the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get at least $14,500 for the product. This is a significant discount from my initial offer. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you need a certain price, but $14,500 is still above what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $14,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Bob is unlikely to go much higher and we are getting close to John's offer. It's better to secure a deal now at $14,000 than risk getting stuck with a lower offer or having to settle for $15,000 from John later."
