"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $12,000 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $15,500? This product truly offers exceptional value at that price.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $15,500 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. Let's see if we can close the deal. ",13000.0,Bob,4,
