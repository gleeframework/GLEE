"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a fair price considering the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price.** $11,000 is only $500 more than Bob's counteroffer, and significantly less than John's price of $12,000.
* **Continuing to negotiate may not yield a much better result.** There's a risk that Alice will either refuse a further counteroffer or walk away from the deal entirely. 
* **Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price.**  While he might be able to get it for slightly less, the risk of losing the deal altogether is not worth the potential savings."
