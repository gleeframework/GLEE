"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is above Bob's maximum price.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $9,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is my best price for now, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum price of $10,000.  Since Bob can buy the product from John for $10,000, it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can secure a better price.  There are still rounds left, and Bob might be able to push Alice further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's try $10,250. This would be a fair compromise for both of us and we can move forward."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. I can see that $10,250 is still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,500. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum price of $10,000.  Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get the price down further. There are still rounds left and the opportunity to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting very close! While I appreciate you coming down in price, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can close this deal with a final offer of $10,100. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to move forward."", ""product_price"": 10100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're really close now, Bob! I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I can see that $10,100 is a good price, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target. I'm willing to meet you at $10,150, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,150 is still above Bob's maximum price of $10,000.  While they are very close to a deal, Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John to buy the product for $10,000. It's not worth risking further negotiation, as there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and Bob might end up paying more than he needs to.  It's best to secure the product from John at the guaranteed price and save the time and effort of continued negotiation."
