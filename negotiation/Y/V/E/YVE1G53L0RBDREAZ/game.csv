"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1000000 is a significant amount, it's simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This still gives you a great deal on this valuable product, and it's much closer to what it's worth to me. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1750000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product. Let me know if you're open to this offer.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $1250000 is closer, but still too far below what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and drop my price to $1625000.  This is a fair price that considers both of our needs and allows us to finalize this deal.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.",1625000.0,Alice,5,
