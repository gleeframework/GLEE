Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1000000 is a significant amount, it's simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This still gives you a great deal on this valuable product, and it's much closer to what it's worth to me. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget.  You can try to negotiate further with Alice, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $1250000 is closer, but still too far below what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and drop my price to $1625000.  This is a fair price that considers both of our needs and allows us to finalize this deal.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and at this point, you've negotiated several rounds without significant progress.  It's better to secure the product from John at your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  You can always revisit the opportunity with Alice later if the market conditions change."
