"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $12000.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16000. Would you be interested in that price?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $12000.  If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to look at other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,
