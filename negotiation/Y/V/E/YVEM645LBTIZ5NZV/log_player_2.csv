# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far more than he's willing to pay, and he has a better alternative in John.  He should counteroffer Alice and see if they can come to a more agreeable price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16000. Would you be interested in that price?

While $16,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  He's better off sticking with his counteroffer of $12,000 or buying from John."
