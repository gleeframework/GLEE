"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10000 is too far below my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $15000?  This would still be a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $13500? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make it work within my budget.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13500 is still quite a bit lower than my asking price. Let's try $14250 as a compromise. It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",14250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $14250 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $14000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price.",14000.0,Bob,6,
