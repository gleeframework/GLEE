Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $950,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I'll have to pass at $850,000.  I'm willing to meet you at $775,000, but any higher and I'm better off exploring other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently undervaluing the product and moving slowly. While $775,000 is a significant sum, it's clear from the negotiation patterns that Bob is unlikely to meet the $850,000 mark, let alone my true desired price. 

Selling to John guarantees the full value and avoids further time and effort spent negotiating with Bob."
