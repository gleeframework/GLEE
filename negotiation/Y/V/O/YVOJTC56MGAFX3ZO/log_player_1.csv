Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This price is closer to my budget and still represents a significant profit for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to move forward. Let's work together to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
