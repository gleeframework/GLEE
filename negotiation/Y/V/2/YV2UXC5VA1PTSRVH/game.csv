"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is excellent, that price point is a little high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is worth more than $700,000. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be honest, $850,000 is still a little rich for my blood. How about we settle at $775,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $775,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to get this deal done. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, which is only $50,000 above your previous offer. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower.  Would you consider $800,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me at $815,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price.",815000.0,Alice,7,
