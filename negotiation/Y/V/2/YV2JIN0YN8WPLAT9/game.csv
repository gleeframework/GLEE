"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for me and allows us both to come to an agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $1,000,000?  It's still a great deal for you considering the value you'll gain from the product, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a significant compromise for me. It allows us to both find a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's go with $950,000. This is a great price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000. This price is fair, allows us both to make a profit, and avoids the risk of either of us walking away from the deal. Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
