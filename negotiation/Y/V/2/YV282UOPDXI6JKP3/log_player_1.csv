"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $12,000 is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Strategy:** The goal is to start high and see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, we'll have room to negotiate down in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  The price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While $9,000 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price.  We have 8 rounds left, so there's time to explore other options before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of this product.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $11,000 represents a compromise, coming down from my initial $12,000 offer but still remaining above Bob's $9,000 proposal.
* **Message:**  The message emphasizes fairness and encourages a deal. 
* **Strategy:**  By offering a slightly lower price, I am showing willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a value that's closer to my desired outcome. The goal is to find a price point that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That seems fair given your last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  $10,000 is a significant improvement from Bob's previous offer and is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Strategy:**  Given that we have only 6 rounds left, it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, the risk of losing this deal and having to sell to John at a lower profit is not worth the gamble. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit."
