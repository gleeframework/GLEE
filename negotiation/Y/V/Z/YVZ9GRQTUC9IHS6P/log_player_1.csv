Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more around $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.  While $7,500 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. How about $7,800? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800.

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  While I'd prefer to get more, Bob's counteroffers are getting too close to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing any more money.  It's a safe bet to go with John."
