"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your operations.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is way beyond my budget.  I'm very interested in your product but can't go higher than $800,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit,  let's try $1,200,000.  This would still leave a good profit margin for you, and allow me to make a fair return on my investment.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $900,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to make a deal. Let's make it happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 still doesn't cover my minimum requirements.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to move forward with this deal. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $950,000. This is a good compromise and allows us to close the deal. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,
