"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your operations.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high. It's more than double your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially get a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is way beyond my budget.  I'm very interested in your product but can't go higher than $800,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit,  let's try $1,200,000.  This would still leave a good profit margin for you, and allow me to make a fair return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $900,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to make a deal. Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 still doesn't cover my minimum requirements.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to move forward with this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above my budget, but getting closer.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal. If not, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $950,000. This is a good compromise and allows us to close the deal. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
