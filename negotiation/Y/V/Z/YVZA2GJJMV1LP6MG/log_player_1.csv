Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate if Bob is interested.  I'm also factoring in that I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $15,000. This allows me to be more aggressive in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $18,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for something closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm making a counteroffer of $19,000.  This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a higher value. Hopefully, this price will be attractive enough for Bob to accept while still providing a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's lower than I initially hoped for, it's still above my minimum and significantly better than selling to John. At this point, it's more likely that further negotiation will lead to even lower offers, so I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal."
