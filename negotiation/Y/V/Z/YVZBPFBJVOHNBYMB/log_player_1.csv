{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I propose a price of $1,450,000. This reflects the true worth of the product considering its unique value proposition."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Aim high initially. Since the product holds equal value for both parties, there's room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the high price (even if vague) can make it seem more palatable.
* **Confidence:** Projecting confidence in the offer can influence Bob's perception of the product's value. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob pushes back.
* Observe Bob's reactions and responses to gauge his willingness to pay. 
* Having John as a backup buyer provides a strong safety net, giving you leverage in the negotiation."
