"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to you.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,200,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,400,000**, which is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* Accepting Alice's offer means you get the product for a lower price than buying from John. 
* **It's always better to save money when possible**, so accepting Alice's offer is the most advantageous decision."
