"Round 1

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept the offer.  $850,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This price is significantly lower than her initial offer, but still potentially within a reasonable range for a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$750,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing that I'm serious about making a deal, but still staying below Alice's last offer. This should signal that I'm willing to meet halfway, but also that I'm not desperate to accept her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $725,000 is getting closer to my target, there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm offering $700,000, which is a compromise between her last offer and my previous counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to meet her halfway and hopefully we can reach an agreement in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $715,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $715,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to a price that is very close to my target.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiations will be difficult. It's worth accepting the offer and closing the deal rather than risking a longer negotiation process or needing to buy from John at a much higher price."
