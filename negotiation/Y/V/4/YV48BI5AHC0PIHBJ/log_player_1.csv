Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you imply Bob could lose out if he doesn't act quickly.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating its worth to you, using phrases like ""given its value"" subtly implies the price is justified. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob only values the product at $10,000.  There's a chance he'll outright reject this offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John. If Bob rejects the offer, you're still guaranteed your minimum price. 

This strategy aims for a higher profit margin but is balanced with the understanding that Bob might decline."
