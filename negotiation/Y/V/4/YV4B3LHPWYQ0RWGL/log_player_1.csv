Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  I'm serious about buying it, and this is my best offer.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'd like to close the deal, $10,500 is too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price, and I'm willing to keep negotiating."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I value your offer, $10,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I think we can close the deal right now. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I appreciate his willingness to negotiate, $10,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with a few more rounds.  I'm not going to rush into a deal that's not going to work for me."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product.  How about we settle on $10,900?  This would give you a good price and allow me to reach a reasonable selling point.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10900}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,900 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,800, and I think that's a fair compromise. It's just $100 more than my initial offer, and it allows us both to make a good deal.  I'm confident this is a good price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
