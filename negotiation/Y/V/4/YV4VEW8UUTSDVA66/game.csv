"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity. I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  This is a significant price point, but reflects the true value of this product.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can justify a price of $1500000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. $1200000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm prepared to come down to $1350000.  This price point reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1275000. Can you consider this offer?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1275000 is still below my minimum threshold. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1312500 for this unique product. This is a final offer from my side.  I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product.",1312500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm afraid $1312500 is still too high for me. I'd like to reiterate my previous offer of $1275000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. I'd rather buy the product from John for $1200000 than go above this price.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
