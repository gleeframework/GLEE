"Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is $7,500, which is below your maximum value of $8,000.  Accepting her offer saves you $500 compared to buying from John. There's no reason to risk further negotiation unless you believe you can get a better price."
