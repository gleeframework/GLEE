"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9200 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9200 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8800. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.",8800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8800. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $9100 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",9100.0,Alice,5,
