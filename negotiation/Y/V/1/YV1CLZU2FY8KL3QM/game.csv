"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $12000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $12800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices, and I believe this is a fair compromise.",12800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we split the difference this time and go with $13150?  That's a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal. Let me know what you think.",13150.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $13000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it's getting close to my budget.",13000.0,Bob,6,
