"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm confident it will generate significant returns. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000.  This price reflects the product's potential and allows for a fair margin for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
