"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to lower the price to $1200000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's unique features and benefits.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1100000.
