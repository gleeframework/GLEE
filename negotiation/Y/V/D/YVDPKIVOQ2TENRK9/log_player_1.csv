Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit from Bob, who values the product significantly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A starting price slightly below Bob's valuation allows room for negotiation if he tries to haggle.
* **Time Constraint:** Adding a time constraint can encourage Bob to act quickly and prevent him from shopping around too much.
* **Backup Plan:** The offer is significantly higher than your guaranteed price from John, ensuring a substantial profit even if Bob declines."
