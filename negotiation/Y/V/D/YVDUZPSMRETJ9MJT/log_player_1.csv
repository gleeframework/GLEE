"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to test his willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reasonable Margin:**  $1,750,000 allows for potential negotiation and leaves room for me to make a profit while still appealing to Bob.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation to encourage Bob's engagement. 
* **Open to Counteroffers:** The message doesn't close the door to counteroffers, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested.  I can use this to my advantage in the next round.
* **Exploring a Middle Ground:** I'll aim for a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's but lower than my initial offer, leaving room for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I can't accept your current offer, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This price reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  My counteroffer is my absolute minimum, but I'm still being reasonable by coming down from my initial price.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to justify the price, hoping to sway Bob.
* **Open to Finalization:**  I'm phrasing the message to suggest this could be the final offer, encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,500,000 I need to make this deal worthwhile.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only 6 rounds left, I can't afford to accept a low offer, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Possibility of Compromise:**  There's still room for negotiation. I'll aim for a counteroffer that's closer to my ideal price, hoping to convince Bob to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also giving you a good deal. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains a price close to my minimum.
* **Urgency:** I'm highlighting the potential for a deal and urging Bob to accept, creating a sense of urgency. 
* **Finality:** By suggesting it's a fair price and urging closure, I'm setting the stage for a potential final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We are down to 4 rounds. If I keep negotiating with Bob, I risk him getting away and losing the chance to sell to John for my desired price.
* **Bob's Offers are Too Low:** Despite some movement, Bob's offers are still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Guaranteed Deal:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation risks. 

I am choosing to sell the product to John to secure my minimum profit and minimize the risk of a failed negotiation."
