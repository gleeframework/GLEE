"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a substantial profit. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm pushing for a price that will maximize my potential gain. If he rejects, I can adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to counter with $975,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price that's closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We're getting closer to my desired price, and I'm not sure I can push for much more. There's a risk of going back and forth and ending up with John's offer, which is significantly lower. It's time to take the deal."
