Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will find this offer attractive, given the product is worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe it's a fair price that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get more than $80, Bob seems unwilling to budge further. It's better to sell to John for $80 than to risk getting nothing from Bob."
