"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200} 
 
I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to see how much Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $175 is still below my desired profit margin. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but still keeping it above my minimum. I want to see if Bob will meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my desired price. I'm accepting his offer because $180 is a good price and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
