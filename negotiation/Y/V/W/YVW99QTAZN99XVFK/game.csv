"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your position, the value of this product is significant and $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I hoped. Could you meet me halfway at $1,200,000? This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,150,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
