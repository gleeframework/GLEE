**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is offering the same amount as John ($800,000).  Continuing the negotiation with Bob has a risk of getting a lower offer or even reaching a stalemate. It's best to secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John rather than gamble on potentially getting more (or less) from Bob."
