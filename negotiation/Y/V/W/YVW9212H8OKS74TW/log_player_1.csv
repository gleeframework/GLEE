"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its significant value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) and slightly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Value:** I emphasize the product's ""unique opportunity"" and ""significant value"" to create a sense of urgency and desirability.
* **Open to Discussion:** I invite Bob to share his thoughts, implying I'm open to negotiation but not necessarily ready to lower the price significantly in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time.  This is my best price, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob has shown interest, his offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price that's mutually beneficial.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially close the deal at a higher price.
* **Selling to John is a Safe Option:** However, if the negotiations with Bob stall, selling to John for $1,000,000 is always a viable and guaranteed way to secure a good profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $850,000 is a bit below my expectations, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to accept $950,000. This is a fair price that considers both our interests. Let me know if you're willing to move towards this figure."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Negotiation:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $950,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair Price:** I frame the offer as a ""fair price"" that balances both our interests, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Direct and Focused:** The message is concise and focuses directly on the price point, making it clear what I'm proposing. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I again end with a question to invite further discussion and potentially reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I can offer you $900,000.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. However, I'm still aiming for a higher price.
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's still some room for negotiation. I believe I can convince Bob to go higher, especially since he's already shown a willingness to compromise.
* **Selling to John is a fallback:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a secure option, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Round Strategy:**

I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's current offer, aiming to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! $900,000 is a good offer, but I need to be a little higher to make this work for me. How about $925,000? It's a reasonable compromise that reflects the value of the product.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:**  I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, showing that I'm still aiming for a better deal while also demonstrating a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** I emphasize that $925,000 is a ""reasonable compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to consider my position.
* **Bridging the Gap:** I invite Bob to ""bridge the gap"" with a counteroffer, signaling that I'm open to further negotiation and hoping to reach a final agreement."
