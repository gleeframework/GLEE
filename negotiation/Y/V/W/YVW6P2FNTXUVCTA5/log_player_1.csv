I'm starting with an ambitious price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm hoping to capitalize on his potential interest in the product and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,400,000 is a good price, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I'm confident that I can secure a price higher than $1,400,000 without risking losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a price of $1,450,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a profit margin higher than my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to keep pushing for a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,425,000 is very close to my desired price. Accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale without the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a rejection from Bob. It's important to remember that John is always a safe option at $1,200,000, but this offer with Bob is significantly better."
