""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think it would be very valuable to you, but I'm trying to clear some inventory quickly. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  A price of $125 allows for some profit margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob. It's closer to his perceived value of $100 than your minimum of $150.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning a need to ""clear inventory quickly"" might encourage Bob to make a decision faster.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. If he rejects it, you still have the safety net of selling to John for your minimum price."
