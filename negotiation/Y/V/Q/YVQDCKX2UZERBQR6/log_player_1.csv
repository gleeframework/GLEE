"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it holds great value for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a counteroffer closer to my desired range.  I'll be ready to adjust my price if needed, but want to maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  It's a good deal, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next rounds. It's better to secure the sale now than risk losing out."
