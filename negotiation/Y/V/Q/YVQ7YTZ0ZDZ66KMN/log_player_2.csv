Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I believe it's worth a significant investment for someone with your vision and expertise. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm happy to consider a price of $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above your target of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,275,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he can get the product from John for $1,200,000, Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is still within his budget and saves him the time and effort of further negotiation.  He's only $75,000 over his ideal price."
