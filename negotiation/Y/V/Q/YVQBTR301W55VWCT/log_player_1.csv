Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to drop the price to $115.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not at a point where I'm comfortable selling. I believe I can get closer to my target price with another counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. I've already had several rounds of negotiations with Bob, and it seems we're not getting any closer to a deal.  While Bob's offer of $102 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than what I'm comfortable with. John is offering a price that meets my minimum requirement and ensures I don't lose out on a good deal."
