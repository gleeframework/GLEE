Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,999. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable."",
""product_price"": 9999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, getting Bob to buy it for slightly less still nets a significant profit. 
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting with a price very close to my minimum acceptable price leaves little room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Sense of Urgency:** I don't want to reveal that I have another buyer lined up, so  I'll need to create a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept the offer quickly. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale without lengthy negotiation."
