"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it.  Would that work for you?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $16,000. This is a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. While $16,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'll meet you at $14,500. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $14,500 is still a touch higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle at $14,000 even? That's my final offer.",14000.0,Bob,6,
