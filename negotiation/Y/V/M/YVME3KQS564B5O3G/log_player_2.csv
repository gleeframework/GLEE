Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to you. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,100,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is the top of your budget, Bob. However, I still believe the product is worth more than that. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a very close price to your budget, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle to get the deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go any lower than $1,050,000.  While a $50,000 difference isn't huge in the context of these numbers, it's still a significant saving and you already have a guaranteed option with John at your target price.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
