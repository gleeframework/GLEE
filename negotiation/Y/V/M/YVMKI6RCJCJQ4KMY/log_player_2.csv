"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $120 is lower than her stated value, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  You're better off rejecting this offer and going with your alternative."
