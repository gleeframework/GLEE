Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $130 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $125? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really like the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

Alice's offer of $125 is within your budget and a better deal than buying from John for $150."
