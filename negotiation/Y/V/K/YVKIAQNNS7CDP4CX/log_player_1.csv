Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer sets a starting point that is higher than your minimum value, leaving room for negotiation.  It's important to remember that I don't know Bob's value for the product, so a high initial offer might make him more likely to counter-offer.  This allows me to gauge his interest and potentially work towards a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better price, so I'll reject his offer and counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also indicates that I believe the product is worth more than $12,000.  This leaves room for further negotiation while still being closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now below my desired price, but it's still above my minimum value.  It's a good deal considering that I could always sell to John for $10,000. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to finalize the sale and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
