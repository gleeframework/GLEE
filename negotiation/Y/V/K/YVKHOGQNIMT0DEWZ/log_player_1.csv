Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $9,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible, and Bob is willing to pay $10,000. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little, while still securing a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** While you could start at $10,000, it might make Bob feel like he has less room to negotiate and could potentially scare him away.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring the deal goes through."
