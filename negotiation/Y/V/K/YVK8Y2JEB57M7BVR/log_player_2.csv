"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,150,000 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is still significantly below the value this product holds for you. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise and allows for both of us to benefit from this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, Bob can still try to get a better deal. There's still room to negotiate, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. Let's try $1,075,000. This is a reasonable price that reflects the value to both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to reach a deal, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise once more. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,090,000. This price is a fair reflection of the value for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price point.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, the risk is that Alice could either reject his counteroffer or, worse, offer a higher price in subsequent rounds. 

Since Alice is showing willingness to compromise, accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product for a lower price than John's offer and within his budget."
