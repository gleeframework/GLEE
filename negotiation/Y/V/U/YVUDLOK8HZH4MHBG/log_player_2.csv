"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. This is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. I'm willing to negotiate, but I have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to see how much room there is for negotiation. It's a common tactic to start low and work my way up."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $100. This is still a great price for a product worth much more. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice moved a bit, $100 is still too far from my target. I'll counter and see if we can meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle on $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

I'm offering my maximum price now. This gives Alice a chance to accept a price that works for me and is still significantly more than she would get by not selling."
