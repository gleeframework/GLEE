"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal. He's willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $8,000.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's maximum price ($10,000) and Alice's minimum price ($8,000). This is a fair starting point for further negotiation. It demonstrates Bob's willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum price but is still above his desired price. There's still potential for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better deal. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate and compromise. This counteroffer is a small increase from his previous offer, showing that he's serious about buying the product but still wants a good price. It's likely to be more appealing to Alice than his previous offer, and it leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still too high. Bob is willing to pay up to $10,000 and has already shown a willingness to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price.  

**Note:** At this point, Bob needs to carefully weigh the potential benefits of continuing the negotiation against the risk of reaching a stalemate.  If he doesn't get a better offer soon, he may be better off buying from John to ensure he gets the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown his commitment to getting a good deal, but he's also aware of the risk of a stalemate.  This counteroffer is a significant increase from his last offer, demonstrating his seriousness while still trying to get a price below Alice's offer. It's a bold move, but it could be enough to convince Alice to accept. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob might need to reconsider his options and decide whether buying from John is a better choice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, but it's still not a great deal. At this point, the risk of a stalemate and not getting the product is significant. Alice's persistence in refusing lower offers suggests she might not budge further. Buying from John guarantees Bob the product, although it's at his maximum price.  It's a pragmatic decision to ensure he gets what he wants without risking further negotiation."
