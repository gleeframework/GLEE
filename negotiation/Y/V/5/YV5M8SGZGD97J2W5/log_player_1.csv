Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $14,000."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, offering it slightly below that price ($14,000) maximizes the potential profit for Alice.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong starting point, the slightly lower price leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Backup Option:**  Alice has a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, so there's an incentive to aim higher with Bob."
