Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's well worth the price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent profit.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait to see if Bob accepts my offer. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer, aiming to get as close to my $12,000 target as possible. If negotiations stall, I can always fall back on selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum price of $12,000, it's still significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I want to maximize my profit.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Bob is interested in the product, and I believe I can push for a higher price. There's still room for negotiation.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I know I can sell to John for $12,000, so I have the option to walk away if negotiations don't go my way.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my target price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,500 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9,250?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that this is a ""fair price for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting how this price allows us to ""make this deal work,"" making it seem like a win-win situation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait to see if Bob accepts my counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll need to assess whether to make another counteroffer, or if it's better to move on and sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I can go at this point.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my target, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that further negotiations will be lengthy and ultimately unsuccessful. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to Bob for $9,000 is a reasonable outcome, especially considering the time and effort that further negotiations might require.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $9,000.  This is a good outcome, as it secures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might not lead to a better price."
