Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you acknowledging the value to me.  However, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product, as this is the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let me know if this is something you can consider.
