"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you acknowledging the value to me.  However, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product, as this is the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let me know if this is something you can consider.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $11,500 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still above my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm prepared to go up to $12,250. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",12250.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $12,250, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $12,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12750.0,Alice,5,
