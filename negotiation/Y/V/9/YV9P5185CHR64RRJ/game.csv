"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I've got some wiggle room. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I think you'll find it's a fair price for a great product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $125?",125.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, but I've got to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $130, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",130.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. I'm going to try one last time to meet you in the middle. I'll sell it to you for $129, but that's as low as I can go. Take it or leave it.",129.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $127?",127.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $130, and I'm starting to think you're just trying to lowball me. If you're really interested in the product, I'm willing to make one final offer: $128. That's as low as I'm willing to go. Take it or leave it.",128.0,Alice,9,

,,Alice,10,RejectOffer
"I'm not going to keep going back and forth forever. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $128, but that's it. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm going to have to sell it to someone else.",128.0,Alice,11,
