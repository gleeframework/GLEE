Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $190. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 190
}
``` 

Here's why I chose this strategy:

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, great! If he counters, it means he's interested but wants a better price.  
* **Backup Plan:**  You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150, so there's no risk of losing money. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
