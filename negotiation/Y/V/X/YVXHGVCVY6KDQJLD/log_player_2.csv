"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first. Even if she rejects your counteroffer, you'll have more information for the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $9,000. It's still a great deal, and I think it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's still worth trying to get a lower price from Alice. You're only $500 away from your ideal price, and you still have several rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is my final offer, as I'm very close to my budget limit. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to compromise again and counteroffer at $8,900. It's still a great deal, and I think it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You're very close to your goal, and it's worth trying to get Alice down just a bit more. You have several rounds left, and you could potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget limit, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to pay $8,800. This is my final offer. If you're not able to accept this, I'll have to go with another option."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,800. I'm willing to make one more compromise and counteroffer at $8,950. It's still a great deal, and I think it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've already reached your budget limit.  While Alice is getting closer to your price, it's not likely she'll budge any further. At this point, it's more advantageous to go with John and secure the product for your target price."
