"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to secure a good deal.  
* **Positive Framing:** My message is friendly and focuses on the potential benefits for Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This price leaves room for negotiation in the following rounds without immediately reaching my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested. There's potential for a higher counteroffer in the next round.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John now would guarantee $150, but there's a chance of getting closer to my desired price through further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and it reflects my desire to work with you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 160} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from the previous round, but not significantly.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the discount and my desire to work with Bob to encourage acceptance.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $160 is still above my minimum, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $140. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $140 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** There are still a few rounds left, and I'm hoping to push for a slightly higher price.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $150, there's a chance to get $150 or even a bit more from Bob with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle on $145?  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 145} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my minimum.
* **Highlighting Benefits:** I emphasize the ""great deal"" for both of us and the product's value.
* **Urgency:**  The message subtly suggests that this might be my final offer, encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $130. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Falling Behind:** Bob's offer of $130 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, the chance of getting a higher offer from Bob is diminishing.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose money. 

Given the limited time and the decreasing likelihood of Bob increasing his offer, selling to John is the most secure option to maximize my profit."
