"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,450,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  It makes sense to negotiate down, especially since you have a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer than Alice's initial price achieves a few things:

* **Signals your budget:** It lets Alice know you're serious about buying but not willing to pay anywhere near her initial ask.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  Even if Alice rejects this offer, there's a wide gap to work with in subsequent rounds.
* **Applies pressure:** By starting low, you're subtly reminding Alice that you have other options (John's offer).

This strategy aims to maximize your potential savings while keeping the negotiation open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice decreased her offer, but it's still significantly higher than your limit and John's offer. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,300,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This offer reflects my strong interest in the product while acknowledging the need for a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show progress:** Acknowledging Alice's price reduction shows you're engaging in the negotiation.
* **Strategic increase:**  Increasing your offer to $1,050,000 demonstrates willingness to move but keeps you below your absolute limit. 
* **""Meet in the middle"" tactic:** This common negotiation approach can feel like a compromise to both parties, even though you're still aiming for a price well below Alice's initial offer. 
* **Maintain pressure:** By staying firm but fair, you encourage Alice to consider your offer seriously while reminding her you have alternatives."
