"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you for $180. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price."", ""product_price"": 180} 

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a high initial offer allows room for negotiation and potentially getting a price closer to your ideal outcome. It also helps gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is higher than your minimum acceptable price, but it's still significantly lower than your initial ask.  Rejecting his offer signals that you believe the product is worth more and keeps the negotiation open for a potentially better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand it's valuable to you, but I can't let it go for that low. How about we meet in the middle at $150?"", ""product_price"": 150}

**Reasoning:**  We're aiming for a price that's closer to our initial ask while still acknowledging Bob's interest by making a significant concession from $180 to $150. This keeps the negotiation moving and maintains the potential for a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** While Bob is inching closer to a price point that's more appealing, we still have room to negotiate.  We're aiming for a price closer to $140, and continuing the negotiation keeps that possibility alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and call it $140? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 140}

**Reasoning:**  

* **Firm but fair:**  This counter-offer shows Bob we are willing to compromise further, but also establishes a firm boundary. The language ""split the difference"" and ""final offer"" signal that this is our bottom line.
* **Time constraint:** We're over halfway through the rounds. Putting a little time pressure on Bob encourages him to take this offer seriously.
* **Profitable:** $140 is a good profit margin above our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to go down to $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** While we set $140 as our ""final offer,"" Bob countering at $135 shows he's very interested and willing to negotiate fairly. 
* **Minimal Difference:**  Accepting $135 instead of holding out for $140 is a small difference in the grand scheme and still nets a very good profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away or getting stuck in a stalemate. Accepting now guarantees a good deal."
