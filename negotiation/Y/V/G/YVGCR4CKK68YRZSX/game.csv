"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm looking to sell this product for $2000000. I believe it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let me know if you're interested!",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1800000. Can you consider this price?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1900000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1700000. Can you consider this price?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1700000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $1850000? It's a fair price, considering the product's value and what I've already offered you.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about making a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1850000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",1750000.0,Bob,6,
