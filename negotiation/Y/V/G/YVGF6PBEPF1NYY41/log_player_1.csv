"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth much more to you than that. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high price ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm mentioning the product's potential worth to Bob, making him consider its value from his perspective.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counteroffer if he's interested. 

This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest while still aiming for a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I am looking for a lower price. Would you consider selling the product for $14000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is still above my minimum threshold of $10,000. However, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $15,000. By rejecting his offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,500.  This reflects the true value of the product and gives you a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the initial offer. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a justification for my counteroffer, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Closing the gap:**  The offer is closer to Bob's offer, making it more likely he'll accept.

This approach aims to find a middle ground while keeping my profit margin as high as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see your position, Alice. Let me propose $14200 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $14,200 is only $300 below my last counteroffer.  Given that we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiations and I want to avoid risking a deal with John, it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer. I'm still getting a price above my minimum threshold and a decent profit."
