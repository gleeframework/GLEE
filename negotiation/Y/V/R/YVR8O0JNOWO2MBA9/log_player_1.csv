"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges its worth to both of us."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value, justifying the high price without revealing my own minimum.
* **Leaving John as Backup:** While I have John as a guaranteed buyer, my priority is to maximize profit, so I won't settle for his offer immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your price. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to concede yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can secure a better deal before accepting or resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?"",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price above my minimum. 
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to subtly encourage Bob to stretch his budget.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and prevents it from stalling too early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit above $1,100,000. How about we try $1,080,000? I'm confident that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is inching closer to the middle ground, his offer is now dangerously close to my safety net with John.  I'm willing to play hardball for one more round to try and get closer to $1,100,000.  I need to signal that I'm prepared to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,080,000 is cutting it too close. I've got another potential buyer lined up, but I believe you're the ideal fit for this product. To make this work, I need you to meet me closer to my previous offer. Would you consider $1,110,000?"",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition:** I'm subtly letting Bob know that I have other options without explicitly revealing John's offer. This creates a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob.
* **Firm but Fair:**  My counteroffer is a strong stance, but the slight concession from $1,125,000 to $1,110,000 shows I'm still open to negotiation within reason. 
* **Deadline Pressure:** With fewer rounds remaining, I'm increasing the pressure for a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you have another buyer lined up, but I'm still interested in making this deal happen. I'm willing to meet you at $1,090,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,090,000 is a significant profit over my minimum and John's standing offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation risks pushing Bob away, especially since he stated his current offer is his limit.  
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation and secures a good outcome with several rounds to spare."
