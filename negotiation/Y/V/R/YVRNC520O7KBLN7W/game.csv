"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get closer to $1,200,000 to make this work for me. I believe this is still a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,100,000 is getting closer, but I'm still looking for a bit more.  How about $1,150,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,120,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can finally find a deal that works for both of us.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
