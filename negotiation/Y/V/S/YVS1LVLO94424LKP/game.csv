"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  It's definitely a good starting point.  However, I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to save a bit more, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $850,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price.  How about $875,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, as it's still well above your valuation and would allow me to save a significant amount.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking to get closer to your target price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $875,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll offer the product to you for $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm ready to finalize this deal at $900,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still well above your valuation and would allow me to save a significant amount.  Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're close to finalizing the deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I think it's time to stand firm on my price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'll give you a final chance to meet me at $925,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to John for $800,000. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,7,
