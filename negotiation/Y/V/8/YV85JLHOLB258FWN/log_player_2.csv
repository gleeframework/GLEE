"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I know you'll love for $150. It's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no reason to pay $150."
