Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  To make this work for me, I'd need it to be closer to $120.  How about $120 even? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

It's unlikely Bob will go higher than $120.  It's better to take the guaranteed $150 from John than to risk getting a lower offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
