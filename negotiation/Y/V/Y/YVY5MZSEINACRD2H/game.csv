"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $16,000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500, which is a fair compromise.  What do you say?",15500.0,Bob,4,
