"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $900000 is a bit low for me at this point. I'm willing to offer $1200000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $1200000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit below my expectations. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1150000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not quite there with $1150000. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. I believe the product's value is worth the extra $50000 to me. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
