Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $900000 is a bit low for me at this point. I'm willing to offer $1200000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
