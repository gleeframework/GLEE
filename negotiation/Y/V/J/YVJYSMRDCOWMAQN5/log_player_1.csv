Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further if you have any thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit margin.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, framing it as an investment rather than an expense. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message includes a willingness to discuss, signaling flexibility and potentially encouraging Bob to counter-offer rather than simply rejecting the initial price.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to anchor Bob's perception of the price at a high point. Even if he counters significantly lower, we have a strong fallback with John at $800,000. This approach maximizes the potential for profit while minimizing the risk of losing the sale entirely."
