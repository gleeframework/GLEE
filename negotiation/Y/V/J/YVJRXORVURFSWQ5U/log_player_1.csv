Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm willing to make a deal at $1,350,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, it's worth attempting to sell to Bob at a higher price. This offer allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit above Bob's perceived value.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offered price is above Bob's valuation but significantly below my minimum. This creates a potential win-win situation where Bob feels he's getting a decent deal while I maximize my profit beyond the guaranteed sale.
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed as an opportunity and invites Bob to engage in discussion, increasing the chance of a successful sale."
