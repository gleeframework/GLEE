Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer. How about $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. This product offers tremendous value, and I'm confident you'd find it worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", 
""product_price"": 17000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to try to find a middle ground. How about $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Even though I could get $15,000 from John, accepting Bob's offer of $14,000 is a good deal.  It's a solid profit above my minimum, and waiting longer risks him lowering his offer or me missing out altogether."
