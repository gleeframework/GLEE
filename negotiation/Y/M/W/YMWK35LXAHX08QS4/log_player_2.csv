"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

This counter-offer tests the waters with a significant but not outrageous drop.  It signals that I'm serious about buying but looking for a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think the price is a bit high, but I have to consider the value it holds for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $9,000. This is my final counteroffer, so I'd appreciate it if you could make a decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is coming down, her claim of a ""final offer"" is likely a negotiation tactic. There's still room to push a bit closer to my target before accepting or resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $8,750?"",
""product_price"": 8750
}
```

This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price closer to my ideal.  It also avoids directly challenging her ""final offer"" claim, maintaining a collaborative tone."
