"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's below your maximum budget of $1,200,000, it's still closer to that limit than you'd prefer. 
* **Negotiation potential:** You have 10 rounds, and Alice is likely willing to negotiate. Rejecting the first offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000 to make this deal work.  This price is still well above your stated value and offers us both a good margin for profit. Let's see if we can find a solution in this range."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand you're looking for a competitive price.  However, the value this product brings is substantial, and I can't go as low as $1,050,000.  Would you consider $1,100,000?  It's a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still high:**  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your target price.
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:** There are still 7 rounds remaining.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and gives you more time to potentially reach a price closer to your desired range."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm eager to make this deal work, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? This offer demonstrates good faith on both sides and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
