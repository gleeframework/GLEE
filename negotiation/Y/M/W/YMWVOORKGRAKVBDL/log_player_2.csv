"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $180. I believe it's a fantastic deal for its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $120. 
* It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. 
* You can always buy from John for $120 if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I'm interested but $180 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $130? I'm really keen on getting this item and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer! I understand your budget constraints, but $180 is already a very competitive price. How about we meet in the middle at $160? It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $160 is still above my budget of $120. 
* I can still buy from John for a lower price. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice. I'll send another counteroffer."
