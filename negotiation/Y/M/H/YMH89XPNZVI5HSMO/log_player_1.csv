{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize profit. I'm also trying to build rapport by mentioning the product's value and addressing Bob directly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking for something within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not going to accept a price that's so far below my floor. I'll counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $130?  This is still a good value for you and allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal for both of us, so I'll accept it."
