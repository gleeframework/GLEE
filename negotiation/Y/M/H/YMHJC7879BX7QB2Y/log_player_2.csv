"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you my product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $15,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. It's best to reject and start negotiating to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it, which is a fair price considering my needs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening Counter:**  Starting with a lower offer than Alice's ($10,500) gives me room to negotiate upwards.
* **Justifying Price:** I've offered a price that's within my budget, and highlighted the value I see in the product to make my offer seem reasonable. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $10,500, I have room to move up slightly in the next rounds if Alice counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating, hoping to get a lower price.  There's still room for Alice to come down, and I can counteroffer again.  I want to avoid paying more than $11,000 if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $11,500.  I'm very interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've moved closer to Alice's offer, but still within a comfortable range for my budget.
* **Focus on Budget:**  I've reiterated my budget constraint to emphasize that I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Room for Flexibility:**  My offer still leaves some room for negotiation, allowing for potential middle ground in the next round."
