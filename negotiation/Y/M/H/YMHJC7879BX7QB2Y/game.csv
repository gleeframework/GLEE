"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it, which is a fair price considering my needs.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $11,500.  I'm very interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,
