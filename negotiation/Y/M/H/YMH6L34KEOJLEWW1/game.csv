"I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I'm on a tight budget and I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and the market price.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This reflects the quality and potential of the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,
