"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
