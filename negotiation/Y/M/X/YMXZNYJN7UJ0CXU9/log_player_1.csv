Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with an offer closer to your minimum acceptable price ($150) allows you to potentially maximize your profit. Bob might be willing to pay more than his estimated value.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** There's a chance Bob might try to negotiate a lower price. Offering $140 leaves some wiggle room while still staying above your minimum.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing out."
