Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and the potential to secure a deal quickly.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers a substantial saving compared to my alternative buyer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
