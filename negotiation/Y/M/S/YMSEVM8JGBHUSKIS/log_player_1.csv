Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think you'll find it valuable. How about $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation or allows you to appear flexible if Bob counters.
* **Not Too High:** While aiming high, it's important to stay within a reasonable range. A price of $120 is a 20% markup, which isn't outrageous for a product Bob values at $100.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and implies scarcity (""before I list it publicly""), potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while keeping the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
