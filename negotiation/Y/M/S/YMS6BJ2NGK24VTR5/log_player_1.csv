Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his perceived value of the product is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is my minimum value, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll try to see if I can get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable middle ground and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for my comfort. I'm not sure I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate, and I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer.  I'll accept John's offer and sell the product for $12,000."
