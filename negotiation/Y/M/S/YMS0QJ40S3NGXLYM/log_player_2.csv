Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $7,500 is still too low. Let's compromise at $8,500. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?

Alice is unlikely to go below $8,500. It's better to take the guaranteed deal from John at $8,000 than risk further negotiation with Alice."
