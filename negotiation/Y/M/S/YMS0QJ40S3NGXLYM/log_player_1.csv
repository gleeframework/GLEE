This offer starts with a price that is above Bob's perceived value but is still lower than your minimum acceptable price. It leaves room for negotiation but also sets a firm baseline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $9,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $9,000 is closer, but still a little high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $7,500 is still too low. Let's compromise at $8,500. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
