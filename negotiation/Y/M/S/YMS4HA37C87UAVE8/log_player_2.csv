You have three options:

``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He's willing to pay up to $8,000, and Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

Bob is offering $7,500, which is a significant discount from Alice's asking price, but still within his budget. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price point. While he could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further. Buying from John at $8,000 is a sure bet, ensuring Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
