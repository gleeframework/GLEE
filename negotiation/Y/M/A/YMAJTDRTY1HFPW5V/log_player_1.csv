{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leave Room for Compromise:** A $900,000 price point allows for negotiation and potential for both of us to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product, making it clear it's worth the price.
* **Back-up Plan:** I'm keeping John in mind as a backup, ensuring I can still get my minimum desired price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum desired price.**  While it's closer than his initial assessment, I can still do better.
* **There's potential for a higher price.** Since Bob is willing to negotiate, there's a chance I can get closer to my $900,000 target with a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is still a viable option.**  I have a guaranteed backup, which gives me the leverage to hold out for a better price from Bob."

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my previous price, showing willingness to negotiate.

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my desired price.
* **Maintain Leverage:** With John as a backup, I can afford to be firm and push for a higher price.
* **Potential for More:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price with a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  I'm willing to go down to $865,000. This is a good compromise that recognizes both your budget and the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal, as we're getting very close."", ""product_price"": 865000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm only coming down by $2,500, showing I'm still serious about my price but willing to make a small concession. 
* **Focus on Closing the Deal:** The message emphasizes the progress we've made and urges Bob to finalize the deal.
* **Maintain Value:** $865,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, demonstrating the value of the product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still trying to stay within my budget of $800,000. I'm willing to pay $840,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Can you meet me at this price?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $840,000 is significantly below my minimum desired price, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better result.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum desired price of $1,000,000, eliminating the risk of further negotiation with Bob.
* **Time is valuable:** Continued negotiation with Bob could be time-consuming and ultimately unproductive, while John's offer provides a quick and profitable resolution."
