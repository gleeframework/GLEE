I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1200000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm going to counteroffer again."

I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $1000000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.

While $1,000,000 is closer to my budget, it's still not a good deal.  John has a guaranteed price of $800,000 and I'm confident I can get the product for that price from him."
