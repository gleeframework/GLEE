"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for less from John, so it makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  That leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $8,000. While $9,250 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it is still higher than the price John is offering. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and purchasing from John will achieve that."
