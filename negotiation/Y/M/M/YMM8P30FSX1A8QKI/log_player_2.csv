"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $1,000,000 is way over his budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,000,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $600,000 at this time.  This is a serious offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600000 is a significant amount, but I'm afraid I need to maintain a higher price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still over his limit.  He should try to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $750,000, which is a significant amount for me.  I'm hoping we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go down to $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850000 and $750000, which would be $800000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $800,000 is equal to John's price. This means that Bob can get the product for the same price from either seller, and there's no incentive to keep negotiating with Alice."
