Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a product that I believe holds significant value for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still securing a great deal for Alice.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a safety net. Alice won't accept anything less than that.

**Why this strategy works:**

This approach balances ambition with realism. It aims high to maximize potential profit but provides a strong fallback option with John. The message is also crafted to be persuasive without being overly aggressive."
