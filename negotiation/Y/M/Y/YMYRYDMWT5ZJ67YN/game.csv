"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $9,800 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would still give us both a fair deal. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,250. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Bob,4,
