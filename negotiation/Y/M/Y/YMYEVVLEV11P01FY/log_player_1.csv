Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer starts at a price that is a good compromise between my minimum price and Bob's perceived value, leaving room for potential negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

While Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,350,000. This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's closer to what Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Bob's offer is now at my minimum price.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm not confident we'll reach a higher price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further risk."
