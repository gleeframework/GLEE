{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm hinting at the product's value without revealing too much. This helps build interest.

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or walk away to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Could you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at such a low price, especially since I have another buyer (John) who is willing to pay $120.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my desired price point, but still lower than the $150 I initially offered. I'll try to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $130? That would be a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get great value."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while making it clear I'm not willing to go that low.  The offer of $130 is a compromise that allows for further negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly to maintain a good rapport with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I've secured a good price. If he rejects, I'll decide whether to counter again or sell to John for $120, considering how much further I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $110 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's still not quite there. I'm not willing to sell at a loss, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $120.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob again. This time, I'll offer a price slightly higher than his offer, perhaps $115, to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. If he rejects again, I'll likely choose to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to go a bit lower, but $110 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to consider $115?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns and showing my willingness to negotiate further.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm still subtly reminding Bob of the value of the product.

**Next Steps:**

This is likely my last counteroffer. If Bob rejects it, I will accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $112? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $112 is getting very close to my minimum, I've already made several concessions. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a price lower than John's guaranteed offer of $120. 

**Next Steps:**

I will sell the product to John to secure a guaranteed profit."
