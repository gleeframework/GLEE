{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This is a starting point.  I've chosen $200 as my initial offer, leaving room for negotiation.  It's higher than my minimum, but it allows for potential compromise while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but I believe I can find it elsewhere for a lower price. Could you perhaps consider $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your desire for a good price. While $150 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $175? This allows me to still make a reasonable profit while acknowledging your offer."", ""product_price"": 175} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value I perceive in the product, I would like to propose $160 as my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $160 is still a little lower than I hoped for, it's closer to my desired profit margin than selling to John for $150.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
