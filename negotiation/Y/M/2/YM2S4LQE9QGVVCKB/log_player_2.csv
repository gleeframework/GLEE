"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident this price reflects its true value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $1,750,000.  It's a significant difference, and Bob has the option to buy from John for a much lower price. There's definitely room for negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,200,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1,200,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise.  I'll accept $1,400,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He should continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming to get the price closer to his target.  There's no immediate need to buy from John yet, as there's still potential to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair offer that allows us both to make a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me, considering the product's value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While Alice has come down significantly, it's still above Bob's target price.  He should continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming to get the price closer to $1,200,000 or even lower.  There's still potential to get a better deal with Alice, and he should only resort to buying from John as a last resort."

{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it's my final offer.  Let me know if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
