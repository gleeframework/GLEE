"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,200,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,200,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise.  I'll accept $1,400,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let's make this happen!",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair offer that allows us both to make a deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me, considering the product's value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
