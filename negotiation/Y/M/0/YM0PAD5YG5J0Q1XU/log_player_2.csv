"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than her product's worth to her, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  It's always best to go with the option that saves you the most money."
