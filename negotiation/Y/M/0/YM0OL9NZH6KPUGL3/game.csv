"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value you'll gain. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly lower than what this product is worth.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
