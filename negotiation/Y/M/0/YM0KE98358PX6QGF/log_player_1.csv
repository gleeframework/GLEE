"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $100. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, knowing the product is worth $120 to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning the product's value to Bob reinforces why this is a good deal for him. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** Ending with ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and keeps the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. Let's aim for $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Risk:**  While $85 is higher than John's offer, it's still lower than my desired price ($100). 
* **Negotiation Space:** Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation. I still have 8 rounds left to reach a more profitable agreement with Bob.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and is willing to negotiate. There's a possibility he will accept a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price, but still staying above my minimum.
* **Value Reinforce:** Reminding Bob of the value he places on the product strengthens my position.
* **Enthusiasm:**  The message is positive and expresses a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Closing Language:** ""Let's make this happen!"" adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** $90 is only $5 away from my initial offer of $95. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's getting riskier to keep rejecting offers.
* **Time is Money:**  If I keep rejecting offers, I might run out of time and be forced to sell to John for $80.

Accepting this offer ensures I earn more than selling to John, and it's a reasonable compromise given the limited rounds left."
