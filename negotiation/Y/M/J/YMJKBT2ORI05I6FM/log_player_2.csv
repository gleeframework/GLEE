"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is less than the $10,000 John is selling for, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting by offering $9,000, which is still a good deal for him since it's less than his maximum of $10,000 and leaves some room for Alice to negotiate. This offer is likely to be accepted by Alice, who values the product at $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,250 is a good compromise for Bob. It's still a good deal for him, as it's less than his maximum price and better than the price John is offering. Further negotiation might save a few more dollars, but it might also risk Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John."
