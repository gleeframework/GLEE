"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $500000.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $500000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated.  I'm willing to lower my price to $750000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential, and it gives you a good return on investment. Let's find a middle ground.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting closer. $600000 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $650000. This gives you a good deal while ensuring I receive a fair price. Let's finalize this and move forward.",650000.0,Alice,5,
