"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $2,000,000. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the opportunity to get a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" product, hinting at its potential value. 

This approach allows me to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and at what price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not desperate to close the deal. 
* **Potential for a Higher Price:** I believe there's room for negotiation. Bob's offer shows he's interested, and I can likely secure a better price. 
* **Strategy:** By rejecting the offer, I can maintain leverage and signal my willingness to walk away if necessary. This might encourage Bob to come up with a more enticing offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 isn't quite enough for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price, but I'm showing flexibility. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while also setting a clear limit.
* **Limited Flexibility:**  The phrase ""final offer"" adds pressure and might incentivize Bob to accept. 
* **Threat of Alternative:** The mention of other options reminds Bob that I'm not desperate and have alternatives.

This strategy is designed to push Bob closer to my desired price without risking him walking away entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1850000. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob has made a significant concession by moving from $1,800,000 to $1,850,000. This shows his genuine interest in the product.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Further negotiation could lead to a stalemate, potentially resulting in Bob walking away. 
* **Close to Target:** The $1,850,000 offer is only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Value of Time:**  Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiations.

Given these factors, accepting Bob's offer is the most prudent decision at this stage. It secures a favorable price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
