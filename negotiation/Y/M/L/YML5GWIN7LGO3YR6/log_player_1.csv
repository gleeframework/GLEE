"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Starting at $20,000 gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.  I'm confident in the value of the product, so I'm not afraid to start high. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  A positive, friendly tone helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage with the offer. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the potential benefit of the product for Bob, which might make him more likely to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his reaction. If he counters, I'll need to decide whether to accept or make a counter-counter offer.
* I'll be mindful of the 10 rounds and the $15,000 safety net with John. I don't want to risk getting stuck in a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value might be high to you, but I believe I can offer a fair price of $15000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept.**  While it's tempting to take his offer and end the negotiation, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **I have 9 rounds left.** This gives me the opportunity to explore other options before needing to rely on John's offer. 
* **Rejecting allows me to counteroffer.** By rejecting, I can potentially nudge Bob closer to a higher price and still secure a better deal than John's offer.

**Next Steps:**

* In the next round, I'll need to formulate a counteroffer that's both attractive enough to Bob to keep him engaged but also reflects the value I place on the product.  I'll be mindful of the remaining rounds and the potential of a stalemate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and see that you're interested.  While $15,000 is the minimum I can accept, I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. How about $17,500?  This would be a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still being a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 17500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and come to an agreement.  The counteroffer is a midway point between my initial asking price and Bob's offer.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair price"" that benefits both parties. This helps to make it more palatable to Bob.
* **Motivation:**  I'm keeping the offer above my minimum but still leaving room for further negotiation if needed. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. 
* If he accepts, the deal is done. 
* If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to accept his next counteroffer or make another counteroffer, keeping in mind the remaining rounds and the fallback option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I propose a price of $16000. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $16,000 is only $1,000 below my desired price and only $1,000 above the minimum I'm willing to accept.
* **Risk of stalemate:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk of a stalemate. Bob might be unwilling to budge further, and we'll be left with John's offer as our only option.
* **Time is running out:** We're already on round 4, and I want to secure a deal before we run out of time.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, the $16,000 offer is a good outcome, given the circumstances."
