{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price of $1,200,000. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's, aiming to establish a starting point for negotiation. This counteroffer leaves room for both of us to compromise and find a mutually agreeable price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum price, it's still above my limit. I will reject and continue negotiating, aiming for a lower price. There is a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to negotiate.  The price of $1,150,000 is still within my budget and leaves room for Alice to come down a bit further. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Alice and lead to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $50,000 below my maximum price. While I could continue negotiating, there is a chance Alice won't budge any further, and I might end up spending more than my initial budget. It's safer to buy from John for $1,200,000 and secure the product within my limit."
