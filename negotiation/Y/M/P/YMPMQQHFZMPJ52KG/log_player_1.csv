I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price. I'll be watching closely to see if Bob accepts or makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't accept a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000, which is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to compromise.  Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'm going to reject it and see if I can push him a little further.  I'm confident that I can get a better price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price again to $1,250,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob to accept the deal.  I'm getting close to my minimum, so this is likely my final offer."
