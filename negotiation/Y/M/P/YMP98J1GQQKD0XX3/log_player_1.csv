{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

This offer starts with a slightly higher price than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate down. I'm also framing it as a great deal to increase Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $15,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a significant reduction from my original price and still leaves room for you to get a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
