{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to $15,000 but I want to leave some room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my counteroffers based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, $13000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my target price of $15,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $11,500 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,250? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $12250.  How about we meet in the middle at $11875? That's a fair compromise and would allow us to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my target price of $15,000, $11,875 is still a good deal for me. It's significantly better than selling to John for $10,000 and it seems like Bob is firm on this price.  I'm willing to accept this offer to finalize the sale."
