Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she also wants to avoid the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product at $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting Alice closer to her desired profit margin. 
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob directly saves Alice the time and potential hassle of going to John, even if John offers the full $12,000.

By starting the negotiation at $11,500, Alice strikes a balance between maximizing her potential profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
