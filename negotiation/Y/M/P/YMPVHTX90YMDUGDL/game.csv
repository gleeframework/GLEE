"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",120.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $90? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $75, so I'd like to offer $82.50 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",82.5,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm not willing to sell it to you for $82.50, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we try $110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
