"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. However, I've already invested a lot in this product, and I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm happy to pay $100 for it. That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be able to get the product without exceeding my budget.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already told you that the product is worth at least $100 to me, and I'm not willing to sell it to you for less than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $100, so how about we try $105? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",105.0,Alice,5,
