"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. To kick things off, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price for the product.  Let's see if we can work together.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,600,000 is still outside of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this deal. While $1,400,000 is still under my target, I'm willing to be flexible to get this done. How about we settle at $1,500,000? This allows us both to walk away with a fair deal.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to close the deal at $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's make this happen.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
