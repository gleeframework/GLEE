"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. To kick things off, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's important to start negotiating to try and secure a better price.  You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to counter and potentially find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price for the product.  Let's see if we can work together."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm still willing to negotiate further to try and reach a price closer to my target of $1,200,000. There are still several rounds left, so I'm confident I can make a more compelling counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,600,000 is still outside of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this deal. While $1,400,000 is still under my target, I'm willing to be flexible to get this done. How about we settle at $1,500,000? This allows us both to walk away with a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my target price, $1,500,000 is still $300,000 over my budget. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I've already shown my willingness to compromise, and with multiple rounds remaining, I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to close the deal at $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
