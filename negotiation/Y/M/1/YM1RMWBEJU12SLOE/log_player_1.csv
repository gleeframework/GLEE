Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85.

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. $85 is still below my minimum of $100, and I believe I can get closer to that value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $88 is closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for a few more rounds before selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $88 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a little more to $90. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
