"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? That way we both get a fair deal.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $92.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88.  If you're open to that, we can close the deal.  Let me know.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $88 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a little more to $90. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,
