"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You don't know Alice's minimum selling price, so there's a chance you can get it for less than $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Explanation:**

Starting with a significant discount (20% off) is a good strategy. It shows Alice you're serious about negotiating and creates room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  Accepting this offer means saving $10 compared to buying from John. There's always a risk that you could negotiate further, but the potential savings are smaller, and the risk of losing the deal increases with each round."
