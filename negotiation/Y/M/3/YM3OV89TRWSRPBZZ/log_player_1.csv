Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I'm asking for $14,000. I believe in its value, and I'm confident it won't last long at this price."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $10,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at $12,000.  Starting high allows room for negotiation.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning a public listing implies others might snatch the product, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification:** While a high price, framing it with ""confidence"" and the product's ""value"" might make Bob perceive it as more reasonable. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  Depending on Bob's personality and negotiation style, Alice might need to adjust her approach in subsequent rounds of communication."
