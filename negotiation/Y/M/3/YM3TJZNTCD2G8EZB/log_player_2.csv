"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, it's still above his desired price point.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potential for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $9,000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  This way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's desired price point:**  $9,500 is only $500 more than Bob's initial counteroffer of $9,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  Bob has already made a counteroffer, and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate. Further rounds might not yield a significantly lower price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Bob is running out of rounds, and buying from John for $12,000 is a less desirable outcome.

Accepting Alice's offer at $9,500 is the best option to secure the product while staying within Bob's budget and minimizing potential risk."
