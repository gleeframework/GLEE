Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. Offering it at $140 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal while still earning me a significant profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 gives me leverage. I don't need to desperately lowball the price.
* **Psychology:** By starting with a slightly higher price and using friendly language (""willing to part with it""), I might pique Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation if he counter-offers."
