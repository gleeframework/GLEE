"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice's offer is significantly lower. I should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 30}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively low counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  I'm hoping to get the price down significantly, but I'm also leaving room to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $40. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $40
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $40 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 35}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise. I'm still hoping to get the price down further but need to avoid getting stuck in a stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $45. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $45
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a lower price, $45 is getting close to my desired range and it's a better deal than buying from John.  There's a risk that continuing negotiations could lead to a stalemate or a worse outcome. I'm choosing to accept Alice's offer and secure the product."
