Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $120, we want to maximize our profit. Starting with a price closer to our minimum ($150) gives us room to negotiate if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $135 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob. He might be willing to meet in the middle.
* **Limited Time Offer:**  Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision quicker and potentially accept the offer without much back and forth. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. It's possible that a more aggressive offer closer to $150 could work, but there's a higher risk of Bob rejecting it outright."
