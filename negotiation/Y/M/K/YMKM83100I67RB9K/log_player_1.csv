"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $50,000 difference gives us space to negotiate while still staying well above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to buy and how flexible he might be on price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe it's a bit above the market value. Can we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, But Room for More:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is a significant improvement and well above my $800,000 minimum. However, it's still below my initial ask, and I believe there's room to negotiate further, especially since he expressed strong interest. 
* **Early in Negotiation:** It's only Round 2, and I want to explore if Bob is willing to go higher before settling or resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While $850,000 is a bit too low, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about we agree on $925,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I am showing willingness to negotiate by coming down $25,000 from my initial offer, but not all the way to his price. This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Holding Firm:** I'm holding firm above the $900,000 mark, as it keeps me significantly above my minimum and keeps the pressure on Bob to justify his valuation if he wants to negotiate further.
* **Positive Language:** Using phrases like ""mutually beneficial deal"" maintains a collaborative tone and emphasizes the value proposition for both sides."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Bob's statement about a ""final offer"" is likely a negotiation tactic to pressure me. It's important not to fold easily, especially since we're still above my minimum.
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting this offer, I can gauge if he's truly firm or if there's room for him to move up from his ""final"" offer. 
* **John as Backup:** While $875,000 is tempting, I still have the option to sell to John for $800,000 if the negotiations with Bob completely stall. It's worth the risk of one more round to see if I can get closer to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I must admit, I'm a bit disappointed.  You seem firm at $875,000, and to be honest, that number doesn't reflect the true value of this product. However, I value our discussions and want to see this work out. If you can agree to $900,000, we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counter:** This is my last attempt to secure a price closer to my target. I'm meeting him exactly at his counteroffer from Round 2, signaling this is my bottom line.
* **Slight Pressure:**  By expressing disappointment and reiterating the product's value, I'm subtly reminding him of what he'd miss if we don't agree. 
* **Clear Condition:**  I'm stating clearly that $900,000 is the price for a deal, creating a sense of urgency and forcing him to make a decision. 
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** I'm mentally prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob remains firm at $875,000.  While losing out on a potential extra $25,000, getting $900,000 is still a very strong outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product, as I mentioned earlier. I'm confident that this is a fair price, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is Firm:**  Bob has now countered twice with $875,000 and reiterated his position. It's highly unlikely he'll go higher.
* **Strong Profit Still:** While not my ideal target, $875,000 is still a $75,000 profit over my minimum and a good outcome overall.
* **Time and Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns.  There's a risk Bob could walk away, leaving me with John's lower offer.  It's better to secure the current offer than risk losing a good deal."
