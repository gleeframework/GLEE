"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $10,250 is still within Bob's budget and is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $11,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While Bob could try to counteroffer again, there's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower price.  
* **Risk:**  Going to John would cost $12,000. Accepting Alice's offer saves $1,750 compared to that.

Given these factors, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice for Bob at this point."
