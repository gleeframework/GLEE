The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $110.  This is a good deal, but you can potentially save more money by counteroffering."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $115 is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $120 to you.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and you'll end up buying from John for $120.  It's better to lock in the lower price now."
