Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your target price of $750,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product for $800,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has drawn a line in the sand, stating this is her final offer. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll hold firm, and we'd end up having to buy from John at the full price.  Accepting $800,000 secures a significant $400,000 savings, which is a good outcome."
