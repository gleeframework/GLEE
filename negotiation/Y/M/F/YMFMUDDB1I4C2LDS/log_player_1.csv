"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer but $2,000,000 is far too high for me. Given my research, I believe a fair starting point for the product would be $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your perspective. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to come down, $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'm ready to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which reflects a fair value for both of us. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is moving closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not losing money by continuing the negotiation. I'll hold out a bit longer to try and secure a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,650,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,650,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $1,500,000. This would be a fair price that respects both of our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has met my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I can negotiate a higher price, and I risk him walking away. It's best to accept this offer now."
