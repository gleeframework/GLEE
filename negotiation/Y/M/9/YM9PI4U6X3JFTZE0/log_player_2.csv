You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is tempting, you know you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. This means you have a price ceiling.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the opportunity for her to potentially lower the price further, getting you a better deal."
