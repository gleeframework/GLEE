**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much as possible from the sale.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $8,000.
* **John's Guarantee:** We have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 if Bob declines.

By offering the product at $9,500, we aim for a price that is:

* **Above Bob's Valuation:**  Making it attractive for us if he accepts.
* **Below John's Offer:**  Ensuring we still make a profit if Bob rejects and we sell to John."
