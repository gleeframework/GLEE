"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $2,300,000. I would like to propose an offer closer to my maximum willingness to pay, which is $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price point reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I recognize the value in the product, I still believe it's priced higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I would like to propose an offer of $1,500,000, which I think is a fair compromise considering my budget. I hope this suggestion is within your consideration.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
