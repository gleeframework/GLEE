Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum. Any deal needs to bridge this gap.

**Strategy**

Since Bob won't pay more than $1,200,000, a traditional negotiation is impossible. You have two options:

1. **Accept John's Offer:** This is the most logical choice. You get your minimum price with no risk.

2. **""Take it or Leave it"" to Bob:** You could offer the product to Bob at $1,200,000, knowing he's unlikely to find a better deal elsewhere.  This is risky, as he might reject it, and you'll lose John's guaranteed offer.

**Offer (Recommended)**

Since the goal is to maximize profit, accepting John's offer is the safest and most profitable approach. There's no need to send an offer to Bob.

**If you *had* to send an offer to Bob (not recommended):**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a one-time, non-negotiable price of $1,200,000 for this product. I have another buyer lined up, so this offer expires quickly."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Important Note:**  This offer to Bob is very high-risk. There's a high chance Bob will reject it, and you'll lose the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
