"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $100 to Alice, so $120 is a decent starting price. However, you have a cap of $150 and there are 9 rounds left, so you have room to negotiate.  Rejecting allows for a counteroffer and potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $105. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating that I'm serious about getting a good price. However, it's still above Alice's value of $100, leaving room for potential compromise. With 9 rounds remaining, we have time to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, but it's closer to my maximum. However, I'm not in a rush and there are still 8 rounds left. Rejecting and making a counteroffer could potentially lead to a lower price, especially if Alice is motivated to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $115. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still keeping the price below my maximum of $150. Alice may be more likely to accept this offer than my previous one, as it's closer to her starting point.  With 7 rounds remaining, I have time for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my ideal price, but with only 6 rounds remaining, I need to push for a lower price. Rejecting and counteroffering allows for further negotiation and potentially a more favorable deal before I resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $120. This is a compromise, demonstrating that I'm willing to meet Alice halfway. It's still lower than her last offer, and with only 5 rounds remaining, the pressure is on to find a mutually agreeable price. If Alice rejects this offer, I may have to consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $128
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, with only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation and a potential rejection is too high. I'm close to my maximum price of $150, and the potential for further negotiation is limited. Buying from John for $150 would be a worse outcome. Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price, even if it's not the best possible deal."
