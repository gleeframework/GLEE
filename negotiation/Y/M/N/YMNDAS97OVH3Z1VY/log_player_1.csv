"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $180 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price above what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still within a reasonable range. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a potential benefit for Bob, highlighting the product's value. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  The message leaves open the possibility for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I think the product is interesting, but I was hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation room:**  I still have 8 rounds to negotiate with Bob, and there's room to get closer to a mutually acceptable price.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While selling to John is a guaranteed $150, I might be able to get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm open to $160. This price still reflects the product's value, and it's a good starting point for us to reach a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with rationale:** I'm not simply rejecting his offer but providing a counteroffer with a reason, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Moving closer to his price:** I'm coming down from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility without giving away too much.
* **Positive tone:**  The message remains positive and friendly, keeping the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand that $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $140 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still below what I want to get for the product.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I have 6 rounds left to negotiate with Bob and might be able to get him to pay closer to my desired price.
* **Risk of losing a better deal:**  While selling to John is a guaranteed $150, I'm not desperate and believe I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $140 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to the product's real value. I'm willing to come down to $150. This is my final offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm signaling that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Meeting my minimum:**  $150 is my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not going lower.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Direct and concise:**  The message is direct and concise, focusing on the price and decision point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a price closer to the product's value, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are now at Round 6, leaving only 4 rounds remaining. 
* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $130 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Guaranteed deal:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is my minimum acceptable price and a better deal than what Bob is offering.
* **Risk of getting nothing:**  If I continue negotiating with Bob, there's a risk that we won't reach a deal within the remaining rounds, leaving me with nothing. 

It's better to secure the guaranteed deal with John and avoid the risk of getting nothing from Bob."
