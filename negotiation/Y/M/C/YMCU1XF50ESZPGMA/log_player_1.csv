Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your minimum of $80, but not too high to scare Bob away.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob knows there's potential for a lower price, encouraging him to engage. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  Bob knows exactly what you're offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $70 is more than your minimum, it's still a significant drop from your initial offer. It's worth trying to get a higher price, as you know Bob values the product at $100. By rejecting his offer, you can counter with a price closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  That's a fair price considering what the product is worth to both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's worth a lot to you, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price,  $78 is close to my minimum and I'm unsure how much lower Bob will go. It's also a better deal than selling to John for $80. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
