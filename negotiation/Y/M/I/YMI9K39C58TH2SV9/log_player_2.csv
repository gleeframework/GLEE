"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,500.  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe you'd find it equally valuable.  If you're interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $10,000.  While she claims she'll sell it to someone else for $10,000, you know John will sell it to you for that price. It's better to stick to your budget and go with John."
