Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your position, and I'm trying to be reasonable here.  $7,250 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.  Let's do $7,400, and we can finalize the deal.  It's getting late, and I don't want to lose this opportunity to sell to you.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **We're below John's price:** Alice is offering the product for $7,400, which is less than John's $8,000 price tag. 
* **Diminishing returns:** We're unlikely to get a much better deal from Alice at this point.  She's clearly trying to close the deal, and further haggling might annoy her.

This offer saves us $600 compared to John's price, which is a good deal!"
