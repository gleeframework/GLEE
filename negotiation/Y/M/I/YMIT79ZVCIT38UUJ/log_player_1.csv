I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $800,000, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I believe it's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum value of $800,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum value and might entice Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

While I'd like to get even closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $850,000 is a good deal. It's above my minimum value of $800,000 and represents a decent compromise.  I'm going to accept his offer."
