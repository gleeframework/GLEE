"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a little too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $105. It's a fair price considering its value to you.",105.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $97, Bob. I think you're getting a great deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $102. It's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while.",102.0,Alice,5,
