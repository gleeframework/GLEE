Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. My initial offer is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $850,000, which is a fair price considering my maximum limit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum limit, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. While she has moved closer to his price point,  it's still above his maximum limit.  Bob can still attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the revised offer, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. Given my budget constraints and the value I place on this product, I can offer a final price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'll make one more concession. My revised offer is $1,050,000, but this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum, it's still above his $800,000 threshold. Bob has a few rounds left and could potentially get a better price, so it's not advisable to accept yet.  He should try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm prepared to offer $975,000, which reflects a significant compromise on my part. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the product's true value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see a stronger commitment from you. My revised offer is $1,025,000, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I expect a serious response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still above Bob's maximum of $800,000.  While there's a chance he could negotiate further, it's risky with only a few rounds remaining. The value of the product to Bob is significantly lower than the current offer.  

By buying from John, Bob secures the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially ending without a deal."
