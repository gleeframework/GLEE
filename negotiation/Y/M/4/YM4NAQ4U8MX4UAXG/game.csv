"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. My initial offer is $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $850,000, which is a fair price considering my maximum limit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum limit, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the revised offer, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. Given my budget constraints and the value I place on this product, I can offer a final price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'll make one more concession. My revised offer is $1,050,000, but this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm prepared to offer $975,000, which reflects a significant compromise on my part. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the product's true value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see a stronger commitment from you. My revised offer is $1,025,000, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I expect a serious response.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
