{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $110 is higher than Bob's valuation of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** $110 is higher than your minimum of $120, allowing you to potentially make a profit. 
* **It leaves space for counteroffers:** Bob might be willing to pay a bit more, so this offer sets up the possibility for a mutually beneficial agreement. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. It's a bit out of my budget at $110, but I really like the product and I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not ready to accept his offer just yet.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $100? That gives you a good deal and still allows me to make a decent profit. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept. I'm confident I can get a bit more from Bob. I'll counteroffer one last time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $97.50. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, and I'm not willing to go above $90. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer of $90 is still below my minimum of $120.  I've already made several counteroffers, and it seems like further negotiation won't get me closer to my desired price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120, ensuring I at least meet my minimum profit."
