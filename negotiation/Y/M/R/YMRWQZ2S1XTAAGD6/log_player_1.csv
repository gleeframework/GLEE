"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win situation for both of us."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While $95 is not my ideal price, it is higher than selling to John.  With limited rounds remaining, it's important to secure a deal and maximize my earnings."
