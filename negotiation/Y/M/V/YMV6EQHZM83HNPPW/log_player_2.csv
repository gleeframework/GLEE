Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm thinking of $11,000. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Explanation:  Alice seems to be stuck in the $10,000 - $11,000 range, and consistently rejects offers lower than $10,000. There's little point in continuing negotiations as it's unlikely she'll go lower. John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000, which is a better deal than anything Alice is offering."
