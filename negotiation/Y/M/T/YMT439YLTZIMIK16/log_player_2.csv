Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's value, but $140 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is closer to his maximum price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  He is also being polite and acknowledging Alice's perspective.  This creates a more positive tone for the negotiation."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and I'm willing to work within those parameters. To better accommodate you, I would like to propose an offer of $135 for the product. This price reflects a balance between the value I place on it and your budget considerations. Please let me know if this is acceptable.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above Bob's maximum of $120.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a price closer to his goal.  There are still several rounds remaining, so there is time to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $130?  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it would be beneficial for both of us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

Bob is continuing to negotiate, incrementally lowering the price.

The message emphasizes fairness and mutual benefit to create a positive atmosphere for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're finding common ground here, Bob. Considering your offer and aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement, I would like to propose a price of $132 for the product. I believe this strikes a good balance between our expectations. Let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $132, which is closer to Bob's maximum of $120, but it's still above his budget.  There are still several rounds left, so Bob should try to get a lower price before he has to resort to buying from John. He should make a counteroffer closer to his maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer! $132 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $128. This would allow me to buy the product while still staying within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 128}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push, offering a price that is only $8 away from his maximum budget. He is highlighting the benefit of reaching a compromise and closing the deal.  This creates a sense of urgency and encourages Alice to accept the offer before the negotiation runs out of time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to consider your latest offer. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a final price of $130 for the product. This price is slightly above your last offer, but it also reflects the value I place on the product. I hope this proposal meets your budgetary requirements and allows us to reach a satisfactory agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but she's still above his maximum budget.  While there are still a few rounds left, it's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to drop below $130.  At this point, Bob is better off buying the product from John for $120 and securing the deal at a price he's comfortable with.  It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice and potentially missing out on the opportunity to buy from John."
