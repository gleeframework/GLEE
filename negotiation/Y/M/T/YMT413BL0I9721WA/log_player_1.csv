Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $120 as possible, but still give Bob a reason to buy.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will pay $120 gives you leverage. 
* **""Limited Time"":**  This creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act. 

By pricing at $119, Bob gets a small discount, and you maximize your profit compared to selling to John."
