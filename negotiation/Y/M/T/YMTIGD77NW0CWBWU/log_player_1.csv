Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** While I didn't explicitly state the value in the message, framing it as a ""significant value"" proposition subtly implies that the price isn't arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is conversational (""What do you think?"") indicating a willingness to discuss the price further if Bob hesitates.

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, since my fallback is selling to John for $8,000, there's a potential $2,000 profit to be made if Bob accepts."
