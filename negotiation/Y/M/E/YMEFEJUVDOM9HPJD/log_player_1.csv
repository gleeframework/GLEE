Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1300000. This would still be a good deal for you as you value it at $1500000. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
