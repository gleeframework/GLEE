"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1200000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, you can potentially do better. You know the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, and Alice is willing to sell for less than her value of $1,500,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate further and try to get a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This would still be a good deal for you as you value it at $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1300000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1350000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $1500000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is closer to your desired price point. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice refusing and potentially getting even worse offers. 

* You are saving $50,000 compared to her initial offer.
* Buying from John would be the same price, but there's no guarantee you wouldn't be able to negotiate lower with Alice.

Since there's not a huge difference between the two, it's safer to accept the offer and secure the product."
