{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $12,000 is higher than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's potential for him to counteroffer and for you to find a price you're both happy with.
* **It shows you're serious:** Offering a price upfront demonstrates that you're interested in selling and willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $9,000 is still above your minimum, it's significantly less than your initial offer.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired profit margin."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,800?

You have three options:

While $9,800 is close to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher profit.  Rejecting allows me to try one more counteroffer to get closer to my desired price."

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting very close to my minimum, but it's still not enough to make a substantial profit.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $8,000.  This ensures I at least cover my minimum and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
