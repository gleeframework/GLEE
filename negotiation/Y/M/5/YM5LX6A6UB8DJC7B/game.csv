"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $115 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let me know if you're interested in that price.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? I'm sure we can reach an agreement if we're both willing to be flexible.",107.5,Bob,4,
