"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited about the potential for this product in your hands. I'm offering it to you for $1400000. This price reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a better price than Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth negotiating further to see if a more favorable price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my maximum budget, I'd like to offer $1,250,000.  This represents a fair price for both of us, and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1250000 is significantly below the value I place on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which I believe reflects a fair compromise. This allows for a mutually beneficial deal while still recognizing the product's worth.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $1,350,000 is below Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price:**  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting another offer is high.  It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $1,350,000, and Bob could end up paying the same price or even more if he rejects and Alice counters.
* **Accepting the offer minimizes risk:**  Accepting the offer guarantees Bob gets the product at a price within his budget.  It also avoids the potential for a breakdown in negotiations and having to buy from John."
