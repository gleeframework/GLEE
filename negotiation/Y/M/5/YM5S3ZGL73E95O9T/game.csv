"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my maximum budget, I'd like to offer $1250000.  This represents a fair price for both of us, and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1250000 is significantly below the value I place on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which I believe reflects a fair compromise. This allows for a mutually beneficial deal while still recognizing the product's worth. ",1350000.0,Alice,3,
