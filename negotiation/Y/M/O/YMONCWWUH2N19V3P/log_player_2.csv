"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is significantly closer to Bob's desired price of $750,000. This is a good deal for Bob, saving him $150,000 compared to buying from John.  While there's still room for negotiation, accepting the offer minimizes the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price."
