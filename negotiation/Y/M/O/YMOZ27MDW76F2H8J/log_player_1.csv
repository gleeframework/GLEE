Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $150 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this is your initial offer, starting a bit lower leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially landing you closer to your desired price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the security of John's offer ($150), so you're not desperate to sell to Bob at any price.

This strategy balances your desire for maximum profit with the need to make the offer attractive to Bob."
