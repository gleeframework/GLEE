{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity for you, and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable to your business.  I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000.  This price reflects the significant value you'll gain, but also leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive and persuasive:** My message is positive and emphasizes the potential benefits to Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I explicitly mention room for a mutually beneficial deal, signaling that I'm open to some negotiation.

**Remember:** This is just the first offer. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the potential for John's offer to become a real threat."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your price. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product, as that's the most I'm willing to go. I'm open to negotiating further, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'm open to negotiation,  I'm not willing to drop that low right away.  

* **Rejecting the offer gives me more negotiating power:** It shows Bob I'm serious about getting a fair price and that I have other options.
* **Counteroffering allows me to explore the middle ground:** By making a counteroffer, I can try to find a price that works for both of us.
* **John's offer is a strong bargaining chip:**  Knowing that I have a guaranteed sale for $1,200,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a bit lower than I had hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $1,000,000. This price acknowledges the value you'll gain from the product while also ensuring I can make a reasonable profit.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this deal very beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering $1,000,000, which is exactly halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but not give away too much.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** My message emphasizes the value Bob will gain and the fairness of the compromise. 
* **Positive tone:** I use a positive tone to keep the conversation amicable and encourage further negotiation.

**Remember:** I'm still holding John's offer as a safety net, so I'm not in a hurry to make a deal with Bob if it's not in my best interest. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1000000. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While closer, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **John's offer provides a strong incentive to hold out:** I know I can get $1,200,000 from John, so there's no immediate need to settle for less.
* **Counteroffering gives me more leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make another counteroffer and potentially push the price higher. 

I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not going to settle for a price that is significantly lower than what I could get from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to work towards a deal.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too far off from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the value you'll gain and allows for a reasonable profit for me.  I believe this is a fair price, and I hope we can finalize this deal soon."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a reasonable price point.
* **Emphasizing the value:** I reiterate the value Bob will gain from the product and the fairness of the price. 
* **Creating a sense of urgency:** I mention the need to finalize the deal soon, subtly suggesting that time is of the essence and hinting at the possibility of selling to John.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's seriousness:** If Bob is truly interested, he should be willing to move closer to my offer.
* **Increase pressure on Bob:** The mention of finalizing the deal soon and John's offer lurking in the background creates a sense of pressure to accept. 
* **Maintain a strong negotiating position:**  My counteroffer still allows me to make a profit while leaving room for a potential compromise in the next round if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to go up to $980000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While he's moving closer to my desired price, $980,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **John's offer is a guarantee:**  I know I can sell to John for $1,200,000.  I don't need to gamble on Bob coming up further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially ending up with a worse deal. Selling to John guarantees a profit that meets my minimum requirements. 

It's time to take the guaranteed deal and move on."
