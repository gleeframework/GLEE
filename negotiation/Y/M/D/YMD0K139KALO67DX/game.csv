"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your price. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product, as that's the most I'm willing to go. I'm open to negotiating further, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900000 is a bit lower than I had hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $1000000. This price acknowledges the value you'll gain from the product while also ensuring I can make a reasonable profit.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this deal very beneficial.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1000000. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to work towards a deal.  However, $950000 is still a bit too far off from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This reflects the value you'll gain and allows for a reasonable profit for me.  I believe this is a fair price, and I hope we can finalize this deal soon.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to go up to $980000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a deal that works for both of us.",980000.0,Bob,6,
