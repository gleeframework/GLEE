Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's value *to you*, the message hints at it by mentioning ""given its value."" This subtly implies the price is justified without revealing your bottom line.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By asking ""What do you think?"", you invite Bob to counter-offer and engage in negotiation. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's offer and your minimum price.
* Be prepared to negotiate! If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can gradually lower the price, but never go below $12,000."
