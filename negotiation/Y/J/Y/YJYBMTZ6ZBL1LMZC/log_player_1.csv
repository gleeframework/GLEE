Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. It's also important to be friendly and open to negotiation in the initial message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to my maximum willingness to pay. How about $1200000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I want to make a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to compromise my minimum value.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, which still leaves room for profit for both of us.  Let's try to find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate the flexibility. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1500000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 meets my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation.  It's a good deal, and I'm happy to close the deal with Bob."
