Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think it's a great deal and would be really valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed $150 offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested while still securing a profit above your minimum.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but not so high that it's immediately off-putting. It gives the impression that the product is highly valued. 
 
**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy aims to strike a balance between potential profit and the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
