""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Bob's offer is a significant increase from his initial valuation, indicating room for negotiation. While selling to John is a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's potential to secure a better deal with Bob with some strategic counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While your initial offer was below my expectations, I see you're serious about this purchase.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,900,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've carefully considered our previous discussions, and I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product.  We're getting closer to a price point that might surpass selling to John. It's worth risking another round to see how high Bob is willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the true value of this product.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To move things along, let's settle at $1,825,000.  This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1825000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your proposal. After careful consideration, I would like to suggest a counteroffer of $1,750,000. I believe this price is reasonable and fair for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While there's still room for negotiation, Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is a significant profit over John's $1,500,000.  Continuing to push might backfire and risk losing Bob altogether.  Accepting this offer secures a strong return."
