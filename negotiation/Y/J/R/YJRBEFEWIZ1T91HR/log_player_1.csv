{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant return you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John offers a safe $800,000, Bob values the product much higher. Our goal is to get as close to that $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $925,000 leaves a substantial profit margin for Bob ($75,000) making the deal very attractive. This price encourages him to accept rather than risk losing the opportunity.
* **Confident Negotiation:**  The language used is positive and emphasizes the product's value, justifying the high price.  We want Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal even at this premium."
