Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire it at a preferential rate."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Reasonable Markup:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 provides a significant profit margin above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) while still being an attractive proposition compared to your guaranteed sale price. 
* **First Refusal Incentive:** By framing the offer as a ""first refusal,"" you create a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially motivating Bob to accept."
