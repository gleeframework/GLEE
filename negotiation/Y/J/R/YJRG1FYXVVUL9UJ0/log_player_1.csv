Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point that gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum. I'm ready to see if Bob is interested or if he wants to counter-offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$70 is below my minimum, so I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85. It's still above my minimum and is a compromise to see if we can reach an agreement. Hopefully, Bob is willing to pay a bit more, but I'm prepared to sell to John for $80 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $75 is still below my minimum, and I'm not confident I can get a better offer from him. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $80 to ensure I at least meet my minimum."
