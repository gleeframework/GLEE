"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1800000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay up to $1200000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1600000, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I believe the product's value is worth more than that. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1600000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1400000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this price represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

Let's see if we can seal the deal.",1520000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1520000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $1450000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1450000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see a bit more movement from your end. I can offer the product to you for $1480000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1480000.0,Alice,7,
