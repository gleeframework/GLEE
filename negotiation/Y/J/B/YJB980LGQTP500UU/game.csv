"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  I think it would be a great fit for you. Given its features and value, I'm offering it at $15,000.  What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Could you do $13,000?  That's a significant price reduction on my end.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
