"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,500,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I've done some research and I know that you really need this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $1,350,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my original offer of $1,000,000.  This is the maximum I can afford, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
