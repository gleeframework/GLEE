"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's fair given its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect to make Bob feel like he's getting a good price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not starting at my minimum of $15,000 to allow for potential concessions.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm asking Bob for his opinion to encourage him to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $12,500 is below my minimum price of $15,000.
* **I have leverage:**  I can still negotiate with Bob, and I have the option to sell to John for a higher price.
* **Room for counteroffer:**  There's room to negotiate a price closer to my desired $15,000. 

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13,250.  This price would give us both a fair deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting fairness:** I'm framing this as a ""fair deal"" for both of us, which can be appealing to Bob.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm asking Bob's opinion to keep him engaged in the conversation. 
* **Still above my minimum:** $13,250 is still above my minimum price of $15,000, giving me room to potentially negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $12,875. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $12,875 is still below my minimum price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for a higher offer:**  While Bob claims this is his ""final offer,"" there's a chance he might be willing to go higher, especially since he's already moved a bit.
* **John is still an option:** I have the option to sell to John for a much better price, which gives me leverage in this negotiation. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and see if he's willing to move closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,875 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway *one more time*.  How about $13,062.50?  This is a very fair price that's closer to your offer, and it's also closer to what I need to make this deal work.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13062.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Emphasizing compromise:** I'm reiterating my willingness to compromise, but this time with a sense of finality.  
* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by moving halfway towards his offer.
* **Highlighting fairness:**  I'm again framing the price as ""fair,"" emphasizing that it's a compromise.
* **Setting a clear expectation:**  I'm stating this is a ""very fair price"" and ""closer to what I need,"" hinting at my limit for negotiation.
* **Open-ended question:**  I'm asking for Bob's opinion to keep the conversation going. 

This counteroffer is a bit closer to Bob's price, but it still leaves room for him to move slightly higher if he wants to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway again, but $13,062.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise one more time and offer $12,900. This is my best and final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $12,900 is still below my minimum price of $15,000.  
* **High risk of losing out:** Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but the gap is still significant. I risk accepting too low a price and losing out on a much better offer from John.
* **Negotiation leverage:**  I still have two rounds left to potentially get closer to my desired price or to secure the sale with John.

I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to move higher in the remaining rounds.  I still have a better option with John, and I want to try to get the most I can out of this deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but unfortunately, $12,900 still falls short of what I need for this deal to work.  I'm willing to make one last concession, but it needs to be closer to my desired price.  How about $13,125?  This is a fair price that represents a compromise from both of us. If you're serious about buying my product, this is the final price I can offer."", ""product_price"": 13125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Emphasize finality:**  ""This is the final price I can offer"" makes it clear this is my last attempt.
* **""Fair"" price:** Framing it as fair suggests it's a reasonable compromise.
* **Moving slightly closer:** $13,125 is only $225 above Bob's offer.
* **Appeal to seriousness:**  ""If you're serious about buying my product..."" puts pressure on Bob to accept.

This offer is a small increase over Bob's offer, showing flexibility but staying above my minimum. It's a final attempt to close the deal before turning to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to make one last concession, but $13,125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise again, but I'm getting close to my limit. I'll offer $12,950. This is my absolute best and final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,950
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're in round 8, and there are only two rounds left.
* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $15,000.  
* **John is a better option:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose money.

With only two rounds left, the risk of further negotiation with Bob is too high.  I'm better off securing the sale with John and ensuring a profit."
