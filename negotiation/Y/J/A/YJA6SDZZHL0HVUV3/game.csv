"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  That seems like a fair price considering the value of the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is valuable, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $115. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 just isn't feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $85?",85.0,Bob,6,
