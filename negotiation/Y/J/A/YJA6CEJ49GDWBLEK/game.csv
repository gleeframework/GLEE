"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to my original offer. Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to go a little lower to $1,275,000 to finalize this deal.  It's a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know if you're able to accept.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
