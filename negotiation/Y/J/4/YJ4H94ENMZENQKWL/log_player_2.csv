"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find very valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $95.  I believe it's worth significantly more, and I know you'd benefit greatly from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $100 to you, and you can get it from John for that price.
* Alice's offer is $95, which is better than John's price but still more than the product is worth to you.
* Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option to save money."
