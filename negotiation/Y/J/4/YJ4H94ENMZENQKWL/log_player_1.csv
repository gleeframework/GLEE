Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find very valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $95.  I believe it's worth significantly more, and I know you'd benefit greatly from it."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible, maximizing my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate, potentially even accepting the initial offer.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John gives me leverage to aim high with Bob. 
 
**It's a balance:** I don't want to scare Bob off with a price too close to his maximum ($100), but I also want to capitalize on his higher valuation compared to John's."
