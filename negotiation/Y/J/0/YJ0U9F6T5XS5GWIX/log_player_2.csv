"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $800000 to me, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $850000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential.  Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's product may be valuable, it's not worth paying more than his maximum budget of $800,000. He can secure the same product from John for a lower price."
