"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,250,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and allows us to move forward with the sale.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a little high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,150,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $1,150,000 is still a bit low. How about $1,200,000? This price would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a great deal considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
