"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, I'm not able to go down to $10,000.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer you the product for $10,750. This price is still fair considering the value you'll get out of it. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this deal worthwhile for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,625? This way, we both get a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",10625.0,Alice,5,
