"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $10,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth. I'm willing to come down to $12,500,  which is still a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,500 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $11,500 is still a touch higher than I'd like. How about we settle at $11,200?  That would work well for me.",11200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $11,200 is very close, but I'm still looking for a slightly higher price.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,350.  This would ensure a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",11350.0,Alice,7,
