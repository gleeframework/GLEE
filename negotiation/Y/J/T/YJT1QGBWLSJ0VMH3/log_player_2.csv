"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $100 is still above your maximum price of $120.
* There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $95? I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're still aiming for the lowest price possible. 
* While $95 is closer to your target, there's still room to negotiate down. 
* Rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows for further price reduction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $95 is still a bit high for me. How about $92?  I believe that's a fair price, given our both trying to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $92 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. How about $93? I think it's a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You've successfully negotiated the price down significantly from Alice's initial offer of $100.
* $93 is within your budget and a reasonable price considering the value you place on the product.
* Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it's also risky. You could risk losing the deal altogether or running out of rounds.
* Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price without further risk."
