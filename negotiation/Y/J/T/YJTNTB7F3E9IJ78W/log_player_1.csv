Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a significantly higher offer ($15,000) allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Alternative Buyer Security:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, eliminating the risk of a complete loss.
* **Strategic Ambiguity:** The message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, leaving room for him to potentially perceive it as even more valuable than $10,000. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between ambition and realism, maximizing the chance of securing a higher price while having a safety net in place."
