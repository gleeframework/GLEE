{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right person. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's still attractive to Bob (since it's lower than his perceived value of $150), but also gives me a good profit margin over my minimum of $120.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm ready to negotiate if he wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $135 is still above my minimum of $120 and closer to my initial offer of $140. Accepting this offer is a good compromise and secures a sale without risking further negotiation."
