"Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for you, given its worth to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,750,000.  Let's start the conversation and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a bit.  How about $1,600,000? This price still gives you a significant return on your investment, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit low for you, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,500,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
