"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth $14000. Would you be interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but unfortunately, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm happy to pay $12,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if that's something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 12000}
