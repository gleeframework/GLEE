"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it could really benefit you. Given its value, I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 11000
}
```

This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It aims to:

* **Establish a lower price point:** By starting significantly lower, we aim to shift the negotiation range downwards. 
* **Signal our interest:** We don't want to lowball too aggressively and risk offending Alice, so we frame the counter-offer politely and express continued interest. 
* **Leave room for compromise:** We anticipate Alice will likely counter, and this offer gives us space to gradually increase our bid over the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a price I'm willing to accept, I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to $12,000 to try and reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $11,750? I think that's a fair compromise."",
 ""product_price"": 11750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Steady Approach:** We are continuing to edge closer to a price point that works for us, while demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Finding the Middle Ground:**  This counter-offer aims to find a middle ground between our previous offer and Alice's current price.
* **Time Consideration:**  We're mindful of the remaining rounds and want to give ourselves room for further adjustments if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I want to find a way to make this work. How about we split the difference and call it $12,125? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. $12,125 is a good price, saving us almost $3,000 from John's offer and $1,875 from Alice's initial price.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Alice stating this is her final offer suggests she's unlikely to go lower. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  With fewer rounds remaining, there's a risk we won't reach a better agreement. Accepting now secures the deal."
