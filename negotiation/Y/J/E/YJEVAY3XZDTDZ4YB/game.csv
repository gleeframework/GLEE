"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the value, but $900,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This still reflects a significant discount for you.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,025,000 is the sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers, which would be $1,075,000. I'm hoping we can find common ground at this price point.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
