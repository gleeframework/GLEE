"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's a good strategy to start with a price higher than the product's worth to you. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fair but Firm:** $12,000 is a reasonable starting point, considering the product's value to Bob.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value and opportunity, encouraging Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to offer $9000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Negotiation Room:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price. 
* **Time is on My Side:**  I have 8 rounds remaining to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $10,000 is a backup option, but I'm not ready to accept that yet.  

I will counteroffer with a slightly lower price than my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By lowering the price slightly from $12,000, I'm showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair and Balanced:** $10,500 is a reasonable middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still above my minimum acceptable price, but it demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message focuses on the shared benefit and a positive outcome for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10500 is still a bit high for me. How about $10250? That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Limited Time:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to be realistic about the potential for a higher offer.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $10,000 is a secure option, but this offer is only slightly better. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** Even though I'm accepting this offer, there's always the possibility of further negotiation down the line if Bob wants to use the product.

By accepting this offer, I can close the deal quickly and avoid the risk of losing out to John or further negotiation that might not result in a better outcome."
