"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is only worth $10,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room for negotiation as you're willing to pay up to $10,000. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  You have the option to buy from John, so you're not under pressure to accept Alice's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to offer $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your target:** While closer to your desired price, $10,500 is still over your maximum budget of $10,000. 
* **You can potentially get a better price:** There's still room for negotiation, and you're not under pressure to accept this offer yet.
* **John's offer is still your fallback:** If you can't get a better price from Alice, you have a guaranteed way to buy the product."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $10,250? That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 10250}
