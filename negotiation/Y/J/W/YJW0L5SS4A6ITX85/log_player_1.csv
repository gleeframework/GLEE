Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice! However, I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Can we discuss this further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

How about we split the difference and go with $1,250,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a deal you won't regret."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
