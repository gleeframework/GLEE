Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. Here's my offer:

{""message"": ""I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice! However, I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Can we discuss this further?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $1,250,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a deal you won't regret. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. Here's my offer:

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the price John is offering. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision today if we can agree on that price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
