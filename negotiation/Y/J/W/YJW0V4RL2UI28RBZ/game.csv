"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount of time and resources into this product, and I believe it's worth more than $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
