"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $8,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $8,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,250 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about $8,000? This would be a great deal for you and get us closer to an agreement.",8000.0,Alice,5,
