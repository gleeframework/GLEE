"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.**  I'm not willing to sell at a loss. 
* **I have 10 rounds, so I can still negotiate with Bob.**  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $8,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe that $8,000 would be a fair price for the product. Could we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.** I'm starting to feel pressure as I'm nearing the middle of the negotiation rounds.
* **While $8,250 is not my ideal price, it's a decent compromise.**  It's closer to my desired price than John's offer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
