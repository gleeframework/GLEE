{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a bit higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but it gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, trying to build a rapport with Bob. I'm also highlighting the value of the product. 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a slightly higher price, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to counteroffer. This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation that could potentially lead to a price closer to my desired outcome.  However, I also have the option of walking away and selling to John if I feel the negotiations aren't going well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm not willing to sell for less than that, so I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better counteroffer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $105?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I'm staying friendly and acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal. I'm also emphasizing that I'm willing to compromise, but not to the point of going below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Price:** I'm offering $105, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $90.

**Strategy:**

By counteroffering with $105, I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll still have the option of selling to John for $100, which is my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $97.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $97.5 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $100, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than that. I've already made a concession by dropping my price to $105, and I don't want to keep going back and forth with Bob. John is willing to pay my minimum price, so it's in my best interest to take his offer and avoid any further negotiation."
