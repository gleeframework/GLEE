"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a game-changer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $1600000. This is my best compromise at this point.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $1400000. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1400000 is still a bit below my target, but I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1550000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1550000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1450000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
