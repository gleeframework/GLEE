"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's always best to try and negotiate a better price. Since the product is worth $80 to you, and Alice's first offer is $110, you should reject and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is closer to your target, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $100 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still a little low for me. How about we meet at $98? That's a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $98 is getting closer to your target, it's still above your maximum price point. Since you have the option to buy from John for $80, it's better to secure that deal and save yourself a few extra dollars."
