"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high price of $15,000. This is above my minimum value of $12,000, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I'm curious to see how much Bob values the product and if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not yet ready to sell for that price. I want to see if I can get a bit more from Bob. I'm also hoping to learn more about how much he actually values the product by his response to my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $13,500. This is still a good profit for me, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully encourages Bob to come up a bit on his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my ideal price,  I still think I can get a bit more.  I want to see if I can push him to $13,000 or higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to offer $13,000. This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum and  I think it's a fair price considering Bob's last offer.  Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  It's only $200 more than my minimum, and I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'm also concerned that if I accept this offer, I'll be leaving money on the table.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, so I need to be strategic and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12800}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm going to make a slightly higher counteroffer of $12,800. It's a compromise to show good faith, but still allows for a decent profit. I'm hoping this final push will encourage Bob to accept, as we're running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $12,400. With only two rounds left, I don't want to risk losing a deal altogether.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good profit and I can't guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob or John.  It's time to secure the sale."
