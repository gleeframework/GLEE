"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price of $1,200,000. It's definitely worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds and can always fall back on John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still higher than her estimated worth. This shows a willingness to negotiate, but also sets a clear boundary. It leaves room for a few rounds of back-and-forth without immediately pushing Alice away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to my target, it's still above my ideal price. I have time and rounds to negotiate further, so I will reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still remaining below Alice's initial offer. This demonstrates a genuine desire to reach an agreement while keeping the price within my budget.  It also provides Alice with a reasonable compromise option, increasing the likelihood of her acceptance."
