"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You can likely get a better deal than $100. It's worth negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a good starting point, I'm looking to get closer to $100.  How about $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than $100, it's still too high for me. I can get the product from John for $80, and I'm not willing to pay more than that.  I'm going to see if I can get Alice to come down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get closer to $100, but I'm really only comfortable paying $85.  I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I can't go higher than that."", ""product_price"": 85}
