"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge his interest and potentially get a good deal while keeping the option to sell to John for $120 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value, it's still below my minimum threshold of $120. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a good starting point, I'm looking to get closer to $100.  How about $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get closer to $100, but I'm really only comfortable paying $85.  I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I can't go higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has made it clear he won't go higher than $85, and I'm not willing to sell for less than $120.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $120."
