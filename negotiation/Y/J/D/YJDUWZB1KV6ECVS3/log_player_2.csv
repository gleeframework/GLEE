{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **You have 10 rounds.**  There's time to try and get a better price.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still a bit apart on the price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer.** She's moved from $900,000 to $875,000, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **There's still room for improvement.** You want to save as much as possible, and you're still above your target price of $1,000,000.
* **It's early in the negotiation.** You have 7 rounds left, giving you time to push for a lower price.

I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down again. While your offer is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go to $860,000.

Round 5

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, but it's still not ideal.** You want to get it below $875,000, if possible.
* **You still have 5 rounds left.** There's time to continue negotiating and see if you can get a better deal.
* **John's offer is a safety net.** You can always fall back on that if you can't get a better price from Alice.

I'll counteroffer with a slightly lower price in the next round, aiming to get closer to your target of $875,000."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to meet us halfway. However, we're still not quite there. After reconsidering our costs and the value the product brings to your business, we're willing to sell the product to you for $885,000. We believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is slightly higher than your last counteroffer.** She's moved from $880,000 to $885,000, which shows some wiggle room.
* **You have 3 rounds left, so there's still time to negotiate.**  It's important to keep trying to lower the price.
* **John's offer is still a safety net.** You can always purchase from him if you can't get a better price from Alice.

**Strategy:** I'll counter with a slightly lower price, aiming to get as close to $875,000 as possible before having to resort to John's offer."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your persistence. However, we're still not willing to go below $890,000. We believe this is the minimum price that reflects the product's value and our needs. We're willing to meet you halfway again, but we can't go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **We are down to the final round.**  There's no more room for negotiation. 
* **Alice's offer is higher than our target price.** It's still a decent deal, but it's not the best possible outcome.
* **John's offer is our safety net.**  While it's significantly higher than Alice's offer, it's still within our budget.  It's better to accept the guaranteed purchase from John rather than risk getting nothing from Alice.

It's a tough decision, but ultimately the risk of Alice rejecting our counteroffer and leaving us with no product is too high.  It's time to secure the product from John."
