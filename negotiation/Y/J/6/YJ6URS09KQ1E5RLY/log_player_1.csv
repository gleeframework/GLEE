Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute lowest acceptable price (your ""reservation value"").
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum. Any deal needs to bridge this gap.

**The Strategy**

Since Bob won't pay more than $1,200,000, you have two options:

1. **Secure a Deal with John:** Sell directly to John for your guaranteed $1,500,000.
2. **Use John as Leverage:** Try to negotiate a higher price with Bob by implying you have other offers. 

**The Offer**

While a deal with Bob is unlikely, here's how you can use John as leverage:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I finalize an agreement with another interested party.  Given the level of interest, I'm asking for $1,450,000. I believe this product will be highly valuable to your operations, and I want to give you priority access."",
""product_price"": 1450000 
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Creating Urgency:** The message implies you have another buyer (John) and creates a sense of scarcity.
* **High but Negotiable Price:** The price is high but leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer if he's truly interested.
* **Focus on Value:** You're not just selling a product; you're selling the opportunity to get ahead of the competition.

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob likely won't accept:**  He'd be paying significantly more than his perceived value. 
* **Don't overplay your hand:** Avoid being too aggressive, as Bob could easily walk away.
* **Be prepared to walk away:** If Bob doesn't bite, you have your guaranteed deal with John."
