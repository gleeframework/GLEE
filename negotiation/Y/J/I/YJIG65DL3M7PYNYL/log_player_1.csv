Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,000 is still too high for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? It's a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still too high for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is getting too low and he doesn't seem willing to meet near the middle ground. It's better to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John than risk Bob's offers going even lower."
