"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $175 is too high, and he can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120 right now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should buy the product from John.  While Alice has come down in price, $150 is still more than Bob is willing to pay. John's offer of $100 is the best deal available to Bob, and he shouldn't risk further negotiation with Alice, as the time constraint means he could miss out on a better offer."
