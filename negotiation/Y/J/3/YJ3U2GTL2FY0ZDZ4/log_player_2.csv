"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $1,600,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. It makes sense to counteroffer Alice and see if she's willing to negotiate."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still over his budget. He's better off countering again or buying from John for a much lower price."
