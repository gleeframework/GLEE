Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,350,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, hoping to secure a good profit. This gives him room to counteroffer without feeling pressured, while still leaving me with a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the product is worth less than that. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. There are still 8 rounds left. I'll counteroffer with a slightly lower price in the next round, aiming to reach a compromise closer to my initial asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. While I believe it's worth more than $1,200,000, I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept $1,275,000 for the product. This price reflects the value it holds for both of us and allows for a fair deal. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,225,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle.  With 6 rounds left, I have some leverage to push for a better price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting any closer to an agreement. While I value our ongoing negotiation, I'm also aware of other interested buyers.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,250,000, but this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me halfway, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,220,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer.  We're only $30,000 apart, and I have four rounds left to try and get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can finally reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close now.  Let's be realistic. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,240,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's the best deal we can both get.  If you're serious about this, let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1240000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,230,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,230,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,230,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only two rounds left, I need to be realistic. Bob's offer of $1,230,000 is close enough to my desired price that it's worth accepting. I'm likely not going to get any closer to my initial asking price, and I risk losing the deal entirely if I keep rejecting his offers. It's time to secure the sale and get the best possible price I can."
