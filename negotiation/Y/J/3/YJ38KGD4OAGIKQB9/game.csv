"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $11000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go to $10500.  This is a fair compromise that shows I'm serious about buying your product. What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for $11000. I'm confident this product will be worth it to you in the long run. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I hear you and appreciate the offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $11000. How about we meet in the middle at $10875? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to feel good about the deal.",10875.0,Alice,7,
