Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can make this work.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you and appreciate the offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $11000. How about we meet in the middle at $10875? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to feel good about the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875.

```

You've made significant progress in the negotiation and Alice's counteroffer is only slightly higher than your last offer.  At this point, it might be worth accepting to secure the product and save time.  You're still well within your budget and the product might be worth the small price increase."
