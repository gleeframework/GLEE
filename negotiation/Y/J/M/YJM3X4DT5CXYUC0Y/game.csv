"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $17,000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $15,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",14000.0,Bob,4,
