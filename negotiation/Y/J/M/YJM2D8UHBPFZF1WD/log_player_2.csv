Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

I'm starting with a full price offer to see if Alice is willing to budge.  It's a good starting point for negotiation, and at worst, she'll counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Alice is negotiating, which is good. Let's see if we can push a little further down before accepting."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $105?"",

}
``` 

We're splitting the difference again. This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like where this is going, Bob! I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $108. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's likely close to her bottom line.  $108 is a good price, and further haggling might make her less willing to deal.  It's better to accept a good offer now than risk losing the deal."
