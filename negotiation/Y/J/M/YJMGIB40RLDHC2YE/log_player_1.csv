Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than both Bob's value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Gauging Interest:** The message is framed to gauge Bob's interest.  If he flat out rejects this high price, it suggests he might not value the product much above his $80 valuation. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100. This gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $90 for it. I hope this revised offer works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's maximum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I have room to negotiate further. I'll make a counter-offer to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but I can't go quite that low.  Would you consider $105?"", 
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but staying above my minimum. $105 is a compromise price that could be tempting for him.
* **Final Offer (For Now):**  I'm signaling that this might be my final offer before I consider John's offer more seriously. This adds a bit of pressure for Bob to accept if he's truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am still unable to meet at $105. Could we perhaps agree on $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in risking further negotiation or going to John, as I won't get a better outcome."
