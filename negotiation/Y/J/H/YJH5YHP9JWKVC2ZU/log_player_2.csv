"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $110. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

This counter-offer aims for a price significantly lower than Alice's starting point, but still leaving room for negotiation. It also expresses continued interest in the product, encouraging Alice to counter-offer rather than walking away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. Considering your feedback, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer for the product is $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly in price, and $95 is a good deal compared to John's $100 price. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a much better result, so accepting now is the best move."
