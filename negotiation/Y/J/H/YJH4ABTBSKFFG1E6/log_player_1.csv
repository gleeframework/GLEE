Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're already guaranteed $8,000 from John, so anything above that is profit.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  $9,000 is a reasonable starting point that leaves room for negotiation. You can always lower the price if Bob seems hesitant.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential earnings while also giving you some leverage in the negotiation."
