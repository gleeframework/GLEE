"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a range that I'm willing to pay. This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not going to accept her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my budget. Although she has come down in price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my goal of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $10,000 for it? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm proposing a price that's exactly at my maximum budget, and it's also a middle ground between our previous offers. This shows I'm willing to be flexible and compromise, which might encourage Alice to accept the deal."
