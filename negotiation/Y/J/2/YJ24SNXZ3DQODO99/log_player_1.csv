Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $119 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  My goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob, knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $119 leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to negotiate (if he's inclined) while still securing almost the maximum profit for me.
* **Psychology:**  The price is close to my minimum acceptable price, but the slight discount from a clean $120 might make Bob feel like he's getting a slightly better deal.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping the offer palatable for Bob."
