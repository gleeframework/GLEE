"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That's still a great price for this product, and it gives us both a fair deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $8,000 is a big drop. While $13,000 is closer to a fair deal, I'm working with a tighter budget. Could we settle around $9,500? ",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you about the budget, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about $11,000? That's a significant move from my last offer, and it's closer to your budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for understanding. $11,000 is tempting, but I'm aiming for something under $10,000. Would you consider $9,750? It's a small step, but it might bridge the gap.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. $9,750 is getting closer, but I'm still needing to be at least $10,000.  Let's split the difference -  $10,000 and we have a deal.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this now.",10000.0,Alice,7,
