"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $180?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $180 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can meet you in the middle at $140. Would you be interested?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle on $120?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",120.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're a tough negotiator! I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can do $135, which is still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still above my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $125. It's a fair price for both of us, and it'll help us reach an agreement.",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to meet you at $125, but I'd like to throw in a sweetener to make it worth my while. How about I include a free accessory with the product, and we meet at $130? It's a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for me.",130.0,Alice,7,
