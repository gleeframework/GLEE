Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This price is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, giving me room for profit.  Since I don't know Bob's perceived value of the product, I'm taking a chance. If he rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $120, ensuring I don't lose money."
