"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $10,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $8,500 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,750. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm prepared to offer $9,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product.  Let's make a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",9500.0,Alice,5,
