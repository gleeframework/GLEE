Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable going at this point. I'm prepared to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This represents a significant value for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.
