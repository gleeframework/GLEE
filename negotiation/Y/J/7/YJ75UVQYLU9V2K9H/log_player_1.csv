{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so this offer gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** It's still above your minimum of $1,200,000, ensuring you don't lose out on a significant amount of profit.
* **It's a clear opening:** It's direct and straightforward, giving Bob a clear idea of where you stand.

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially begin a back-and-forth negotiation that might lead to a mutually beneficial agreement. Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,050,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your target. It's worth seeing if you can push for a higher price by counter-offering. You can try to find a middle ground that both of you are comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $1,075,000? This is a fair price that takes your budget and my needs into account. I'm confident we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
``` 

This counteroffer offers a few advantages:

* **It's a compromise:**  It's a middle ground between your previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still above your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum, ensuring you don't lose out.
* **It's a clear signal:** It shows that you're serious about selling to Bob but not willing to give away too much.

By presenting this offer, you're trying to push for a higher price while maintaining a positive negotiating environment. It's important to keep an open mind and be willing to adjust your offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I am still unable to meet you at $1,075,000. My maximum budget remains at $1,050,000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting and closer to your minimum, the negotiation is getting repetitive and time-consuming.  You've already made significant concessions. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is the most profitable option at this point. It ensures you meet your minimum and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
