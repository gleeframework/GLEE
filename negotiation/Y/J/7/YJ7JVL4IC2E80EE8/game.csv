"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's talk!",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about we settle at $900,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value, and it allows us to make this deal work.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about we settle at $825,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see that we're getting closer. However, $825,000 is still below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to come down to $862,500. This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.",862500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting closer, but $862,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. How about we meet at $800,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's the highest I'm willing to go.",800000.0,Bob,6,
