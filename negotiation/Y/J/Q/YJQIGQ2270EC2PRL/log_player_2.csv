(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, so he's proposing a price that's $100,000 lower than Alice's initial offer. This aggressive counteroffer will test Alice's willingness to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, Bob is still aiming for a better deal. He's already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, and Alice has shown a willingness to come down. It's worth exploring another counteroffer to see if a compromise can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's increased his offer from the previous round, showing he's willing to compromise, but he's still below Alice's latest offer. This counteroffer gives Alice a little more room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to save a significant amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price, and Bob is now within $20,000 of his target price.  While a further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob running out of rounds is too high. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a very good price while securing the deal."
