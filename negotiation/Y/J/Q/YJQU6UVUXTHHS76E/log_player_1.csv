"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant discount from my usual price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the ""discount"" to make the offer more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation by asking for his opinion. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest while maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the discount you're offering. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  
* **I have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I'm not desperate.**  There's a chance I can get a better offer from him or potentially even close a deal with John later.
* **Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially push the price closer to my target.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product and the significant discount I'm already offering, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm coming down from my initial offer, but still holding a price above Bob's offer, showing flexibility while maintaining my position.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and the discount he's already getting. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm presenting the price as fair and beneficial for both of us.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm again asking for his input, leaving the door open for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that takes into account the value of the product and the discount you're offering. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Multiple Rounds Remaining:** I have 6 rounds left to negotiate with Bob. This gives me ample time to try and reach a more favorable price.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  There's still a chance that Bob might increase his offer, or that I can negotiate him up further in the next rounds.

It's too early to sell to John, especially since Bob is clearly showing interest in the product. I'll continue negotiating with Bob and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a little too far off from what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to go down to $1,025,000. This price reflects the product's true value and offers you a significant discount.  I'm confident this is a fair offer that will allow us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a genuine effort to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value and the substantial discount he's receiving.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the win-win nature of the proposed price, making it sound appealing to Bob. 

By making a reasonable compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price, I'm increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting this offer and reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and the discount you're offering. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:** Bob's offer of $975,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time is on my side:** I have 4 rounds left to negotiate with Bob. This gives me more time to try and get a better offer. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  It's still possible to get a better price from Bob, or that I can reach a deal with John in the remaining rounds.

There's no need to rush into a deal with Bob at this price, as it doesn't meet my minimum requirements. I will continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $975,000 is simply too low.  I'm prepared to offer a final compromise:  $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows me to cover my costs and still offer you a significant discount.  I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us. This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to accept it, I will have to look elsewhere for a buyer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Strong Language:** I'm using language like ""final compromise"" and ""have to look elsewhere"" to emphasize the urgency and potential consequences of rejecting the offer.
* **Reasoning:** I'm justifying the price by referencing the value of the product and the discount Bob would still receive.

This strategy aims to push Bob towards accepting the offer while also protecting my minimum price point. If Bob rejects, I still have three rounds to potentially reach a deal with John."
