"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000.  This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's make this happen.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,400,000 is still below what I'm comfortable accepting. Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,450,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a solid return. What do you say?",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,380,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",1380000.0,Bob,6,
