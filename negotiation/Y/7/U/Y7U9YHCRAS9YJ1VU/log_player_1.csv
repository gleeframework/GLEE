Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's exact willingness to pay is unknown. By starting high, we can gauge his interest level. If he outright rejects, we can always lower the price.
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 provides a safety net. This allows us to be more ambitious with our initial offer to Bob."
