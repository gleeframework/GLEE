"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $12500?  I'm really hoping to close a deal today.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $12500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $13500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for.  I'm happy to meet you at $13000.  Let's make this happen!",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $13000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $13250? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
