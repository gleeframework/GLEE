"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's better to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price. You have 9 more rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price of $12,000, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. It's important to show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than my ideal price. I'm going to reject this offer and continue to negotiate. I have 7 rounds left and there's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $9,500. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not going to go much higher.  This is a reasonable middle ground, and it's likely that Alice will be more willing to negotiate from this point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is very close to my maximum budget, I'm going to reject this offer and continue to negotiate. I'm hoping that with a few more rounds, I can convince Alice to come down to my ideal price of $10,000. I have 5 rounds left to reach an agreement before I have to go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. I'm putting all my chips on the table and hoping Alice accepts. I'm willing to pay my maximum budget of $10,000, and I don't think I can go any lower. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll have to go with John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,200, which is very close to my maximum budget. I have only 3 rounds left, so I'm going to accept this offer. While I could try to negotiate further, it's risky. There's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and I might end up having to buy from John at $10,000. It's better to secure the product now at a price that's only slightly above my budget."
