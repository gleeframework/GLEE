Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and leaves room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $12,000, he has some room to negotiate as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to try to get a better deal. Bob clearly values the product higher than $11,000, so there's room for negotiation.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $11,250. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still above my minimum price, and I believe Bob is likely to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my initial counteroffer of $11,250. It's also a good amount above my minimum price of $10,000.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to him.  It's not ideal, but it's a good deal, and I don't want to risk him walking away completely or me having to sell to John for a lower price."
