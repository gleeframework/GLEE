"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to benefit from its substantial value. I'm sure we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  To kick things off, I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle - would $900,000 work for you?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm eager to work with you, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's find a price that's fair to both of us. How about $1,050,000? This would still leave you with a significant profit margin and allow me to get closer to my desired value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,050,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we settle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise, I believe.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is still a bit too far from my target.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
