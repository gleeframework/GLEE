{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still below the product's value to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and allows for a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,400,000 is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that low just yet.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,550,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident the product will be well worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
