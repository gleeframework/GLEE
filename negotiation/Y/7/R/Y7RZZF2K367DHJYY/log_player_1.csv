Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your guaranteed price from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,000,000 (your minimum) and $1,200,000 (Bob's maximum). Any price within this range could lead to a deal.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA to maximize your profit. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away.
