"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. However, $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $750,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,100,000 represents the product's high-end value, I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $975,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
