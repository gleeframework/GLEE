"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I've done some research and I believe it's worth less than what you're asking for. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and I understand your budget constraints. While I think the product is worth more, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This price reflects the value of the product and still allows for some room for negotiation. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,3,
