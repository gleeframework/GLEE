"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $90. It's a good deal, but you can likely get a better price.  You'll start the counteroffer process to see if you can get it for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, $90 is a good start, but I'm looking to spend a little less. How about $85?  I'm really interested in this product, so let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $87.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's counteroffer of $87.50 is a good compromise. It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to Alice's desired price.  Accepting the offer saves you some money compared to buying from John and avoids further negotiation."
