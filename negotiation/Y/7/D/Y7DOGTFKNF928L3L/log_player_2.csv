"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that is worth every penny to you. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Since the product is worth $12,000 to you and John is selling it for that price, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice."
