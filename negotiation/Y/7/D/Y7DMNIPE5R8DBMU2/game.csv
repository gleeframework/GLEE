"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is just too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm sure you'll agree once you've had a chance to fully consider it. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal quickly.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
