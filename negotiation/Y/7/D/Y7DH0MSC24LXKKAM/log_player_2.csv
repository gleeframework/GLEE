"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant opportunity to gain a competitive advantage. Please consider my offer carefully. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and the price John offers ($1,500,000). Accepting her offer saves you a considerable amount of money."
