"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. It's a unique opportunity to own something that I think you'll really value. I'm willing to start with a price of $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I still think the product is worth more than $130. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $140. I'm willing to pay $135 for the product.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $135, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you at $137.50",137.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $132.50 for the product.",132.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $135, but only if you're willing to throw in some extras or a service that adds value to the product. Otherwise, I'll have to think about other options.",135.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about making a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $132.50, but I'll throw in an additional service that adds value to the product. Is that something we can work with?",132.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer to throw in an additional service, but I think the value it adds is still not enough to justify the price I want. I'll meet you at $137.50, and I'm willing to consider the service you offered as part of the deal, but I need the price to be higher.",137.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, but I've reached my budget limit. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'll offer you $130 for the product, and I'll throw in the additional service we discussed earlier. This is my final offer.",130.0,Bob,10,
