"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I value at no less than $12,000.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than both your budget and the product's value to her.  There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be willing to pay around $10,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counteroffer achieves a few things:

* **Polite and appreciative:**  It acknowledges Alice's offer and maintains a positive tone.
* **Significantly lower:** The $10,000 counteroffer creates room for negotiation and signals that you're serious about getting a better price. 
* **Not too low:**  While aiming for a good deal, starting too low (e.g., $8,000) might make Alice think you're not a serious buyer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $11,500 is still above your ideal price and John's offer. There's still room to negotiate and get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? I think that's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 10750
}
```

Here's the strategy with this counteroffer:

* **Show progress:**  Acknowledging Alice's movement on price (""appreciate you working with me"") keeps the negotiation positive.
* **Split the difference (almost):**  Meeting in the middle is often seen as a fair compromise. We're not going exactly halfway between her $11,500 and your $10,000, keeping some room for Alice to potentially come down a little more.
* **Clear and concise:** The offer is direct and easy for Alice to understand."
