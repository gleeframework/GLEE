{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do it for $120?"",

print(""Reason:Start with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This leaves room for me to counter again if needed, and still stay well below John's $150 price."")
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
```tool_code

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}
``` 
```tool_code
print(""Reason: I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but staying firm below her $160. This keeps me in a good position to either reach a deal with Alice or go with John's offer."")

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to your offer, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to meet you at $145. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.

}
``` 

```tool_code
print(""Reason: This offer is firm but fair, splitting the difference between her last offer and mine. It puts the ball in Alice's court while still staying below John's price. If she rejects it, I'll go with John."")

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $142. It's a small step closer to your offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.
