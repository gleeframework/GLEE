"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to consider purchasing it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do $12000, which is the lowest I can go. It's a great deal, considering the value the product holds for you.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $10000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at this price?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13000. It's a compromise, but I think it's a good deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
