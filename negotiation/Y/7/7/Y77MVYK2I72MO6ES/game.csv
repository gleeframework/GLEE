"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a little high. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,850000.0
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $850,000, as I mentioned earlier. However, I'm still a bit above that. I can do $825,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",750000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,800000.0
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I've already met you at $825,000 and you're asking me to go down to $750,000. I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you at the midpoint of our previous offers, which is $787,500. What do you think?",787500.0,Alice,5,,
