I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to maximize my profit.  This will also give me room to negotiate down if necessary.  However, I am prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below what I want to get for the product. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by lowering my price to $17,000. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now closer to my desired price, and it's a decent compromise.  I'm going to accept this offer and sell the product to Bob."
