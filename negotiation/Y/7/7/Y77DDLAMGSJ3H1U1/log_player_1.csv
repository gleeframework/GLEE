{""product_price"": 95}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a fair price considering it's worth $100 to him and I need to make at least $80. I'm confident Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell for $85, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $95.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $90. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $95, but still a fair price considering it's worth $100 to him and I need to make at least $80. I'm hopeful Bob will accept this time, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise.  Selling to John for $80 would be less profitable, so accepting Bob's offer is the better option."
