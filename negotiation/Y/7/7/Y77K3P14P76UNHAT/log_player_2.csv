"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is happy to sell for $80. This means a good deal can be struck somewhere in between. By rejecting the offer, you can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product but $110 is a bit steep for me. How about $100? That's still a good profit for you and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105, which is still a fair profit for both of us. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is a good deal for you. You're willing to pay up to $120, and this price saves you $15 compared to buying from John. While you could potentially negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price."
