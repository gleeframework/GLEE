"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product,  $2,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential earning power. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, $1,400,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. To be frank, I have another offer for $1,000,000.  If you can meet that price, the deal is yours.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
