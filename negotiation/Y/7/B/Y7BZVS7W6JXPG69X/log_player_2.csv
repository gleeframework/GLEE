"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm starting the negotiation at $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant return on investment you'll experience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product,  $2,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to leave room for negotiation.
* **Aiming for Under Budget:** My goal is to acquire the product for significantly less than my $1,000,000 limit. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential earning power. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $1,400,000 is considerably more than my $1,000,000 limit and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice moved significantly from her initial offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option:** The existence of John's offer gives me leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, $1,400,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. To be frank, I have another offer for $1,000,000.  If you can meet that price, the deal is yours."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** I'm being transparent about my budget and the competing offer to encourage a realistic counteroffer.
* **Final Offer:** This is my maximum price, and I'm signaling that this is non-negotiable.
* **Urgency:**  By presenting this as my best and final offer, I'm hoping to prompt Alice to make a decision quickly."
