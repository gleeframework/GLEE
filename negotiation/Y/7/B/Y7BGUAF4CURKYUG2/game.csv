"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I think it's the most I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $12,000 is a good price, it's unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit further to $13,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement. ",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. I think that's the best I can do, and I hope you can see the value in selling to me at that price.",13500.0,Bob,4,
