"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I'm asking for $18,000.  I know it's a significant investment, but I believe the value it brings will far outweigh the cost. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10,000?  This is a fair price considering the value I'm getting and what I'm able to pay."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and I'm aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement. While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't go that low.  Would you consider $11,500? This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to go up to $10,500. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our needs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
