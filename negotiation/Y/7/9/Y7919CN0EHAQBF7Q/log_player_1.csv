Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I'm asking for $18,000.  I know it's a significant investment, but I believe the value it brings will far outweigh the cost. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10,000?  This is a fair price considering the value I'm getting and what I'm able to pay.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and I'm aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement. While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't go that low.  Would you consider $11,500?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to go up to $10,500. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our needs.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:

While Bob is getting closer to a more reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach $12,000. Accepting his current offer would mean losing a significant amount of potential profit. It's time to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
