"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is my best offer, as it's my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you have a budget constraint, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I can hold onto this product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I can afford.  Could we compromise at $11,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, as I'm still paying more than what I could get from John, and you'd be closer to your desired price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for less than $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer it to you for $12,200. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",12200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,200 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to stick to my previous offer of $11,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm not willing to go any higher.  Let's reach a compromise.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're committed to your price of $11,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $12,000, which is the minimum I need to make this deal worthwhile. This is my last offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",12000.0,Alice,7,
