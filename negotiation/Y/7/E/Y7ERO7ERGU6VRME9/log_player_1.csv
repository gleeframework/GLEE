"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product I'm offering you. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate the offer, $120 is a bit low for me.  How about $135? I'm open to a little negotiation, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit higher than $135. How about $130? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm trying to stay within my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer of $130. While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation and don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. $130 is a good price, and it's significantly better than selling to John."
