"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value the product holds for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit away from that price point. How about $9,000? I feel that's a fair offer considering it's a good deal for you and I get the product I'm looking for.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm willing to reduce the price to $9,500, which is a small step closer to your offer. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you.",9500.0,Alice,5,
