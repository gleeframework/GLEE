"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe it's a good price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious offer at this price.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but I can't let it go for that low. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I'm trying to be fair, but I also need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
