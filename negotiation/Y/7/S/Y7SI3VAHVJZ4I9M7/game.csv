"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's currently valued at $1,500,000 for me, and I'm confident it's worth even more to you.  To start, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This is a significant starting point, but I'm open to discussing a final price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down a bit further and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this price still represents significant value for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time and offer the product for $1,275,000. This is a very fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,275,000. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $1,225,000. I believe this is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
