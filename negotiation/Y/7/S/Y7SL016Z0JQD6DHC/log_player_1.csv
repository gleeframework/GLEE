Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me. However, $95 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
