"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential benefits for you, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is higher than her own valuation ($800,000), it's still less than John's offer of $1,200,000. Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $100,000."
