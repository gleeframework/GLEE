"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1400000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to compromise, though! I'll meet you halfway between my original offer and your offer. How about we try $1300000? It's still a great deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1300000. How about we try $1250000? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really think that's the lowest I can go.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. How about we try $1275000? It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think we're getting close to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1275000. How about we try $1225000? I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $1230000? It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think we're getting close to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",1230000.0,Alice,7,
