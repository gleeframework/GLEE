,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $10,250.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",10250.0,Alice,5,
