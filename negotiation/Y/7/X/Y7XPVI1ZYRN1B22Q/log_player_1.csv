I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, giving Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a substantial profit. 

I'll be watching Bob's response closely and adjusting my strategy based on his counteroffers. If he rejects my initial offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer to gauge his interest and determine my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a decent price, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $1,500,000.  

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price that's slightly lower than my initial offer but still above his offer. I'll aim to find a middle ground that's appealing to him while ensuring I still make a good profit."

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $1,400,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a price that shows I'm willing to work with Bob, but also reflects the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting too close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  However, I'm not ready to give up yet.  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. 

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price that is a little higher than his offer, but still below my initial asking price. This will hopefully encourage him to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $1,250,000.  This is a significant concession from my previous offer but still allows me to make a profit.  It also shows that I'm committed to reaching an agreement with Bob while still holding firm on my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 more than what John is offering. At this point, the potential gains from further negotiation are too low to risk losing the sale to John altogether.  

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent deal, and it guarantees a sale without any further risk."
