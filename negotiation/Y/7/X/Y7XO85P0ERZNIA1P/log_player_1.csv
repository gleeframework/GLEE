Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is $20,000, implying that the product is worth more or that there's high demand creates a sense of value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is open-ended, suggesting Alice is willing to hear Bob's thoughts and potentially negotiate.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk that Bob will reject the offer outright. However, since Alice has John as a backup buyer at $15,000, she's not losing out if Bob declines."
