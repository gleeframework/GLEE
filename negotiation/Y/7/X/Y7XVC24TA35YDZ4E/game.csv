"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $82.50. I'd be willing to go up to $80, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is your maximum, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, so I'll meet you at $82. I think it's a fair price for this amazing product, and I'm confident you'll love it.",82.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $82. I've already made a firm offer at $80, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'd like to reiterate that I'm willing to buy the product from John for $80 if we can't come to an agreement.",80.0,Bob,6,
