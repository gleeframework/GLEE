"Alice's offer:

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $120.
* Alice's offer is $110, which is still above your ideal price point.
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $120. 
* Alice's offer is $105, which is still above your ideal price point but closer. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice again. You've already shown you're willing to compromise, and Alice has shown some flexibility. There's a chance you can get it down further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $100? I'm really serious about getting this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at 102.50, which is a bit closer to your desired price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $120.
* Alice's offer is $102.5, which is well within your budget and a good compromise.
*  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.  It's likely that Alice is unlikely to go lower, as she's already come down from $110."
