"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a good compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can close the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
