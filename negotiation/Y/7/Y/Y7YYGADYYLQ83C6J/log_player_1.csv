Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high, but not too high:** Bob values the product at $8,000.  Starting at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** This first offer helps gauge how interested Bob is. If he outright rejects it, you know he's aiming for a much lower price.
* **Alternative in mind:** You always have John's $12,000 offer as a fallback, giving you leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but I can only go up to $10,000 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is interested:**  Bob's counteroffer, while significantly lower than your asking price, shows he's genuinely interested in the product.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's a $2,000 gap between Bob's offer and your minimum acceptable price. It's worth exploring if you can negotiate a better deal. 
* **John as leverage:** You still have John's offer as a backup, giving you the power to walk away if Bob's offers remain too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's a fair price considering the value this product brings."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet in the middle:** This approach often feels fair to both parties, increasing the chance of agreement.
* **Firm but polite:** You're holding your ground at your minimum acceptable price while maintaining a positive and collaborative tone.
* **Highlighting value:** Reminding Bob of the product's value can help justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $11,000.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable deal:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is above your minimum acceptable price of $12,000, netting you a profit.
* **Minimal further gains likely:**  Bob is unlikely to go much higher, especially since he's already moved closer to your initial offer.
* **Bird in hand:** It's often better to take a good deal now rather than risk losing it by pushing for a slightly better one."
