I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price that is significantly above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,050,000. This is a slight reduction from my initial offer, but it is still above my minimum acceptable value and leaves room for further negotiation.  I believe this price is fair given the product's worth to both of us."
