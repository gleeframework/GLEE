{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging, hoping to build rapport and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message indicates I'm open to negotiation, making Bob feel like he has some control in the process.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* I'm aiming to get as close to my desired $15,000 as possible without risking Bob walking away entirely.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to counter-offer, potentially lowering the price slightly, while still keeping my minimum threshold in mind.
*  The option to sell to John for $15,000 gives me a strong safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell for that amount, especially considering John is willing to pay my desired price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and hopefully secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet halfway! "", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering with $11,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's. It's still above his perceived value but closer to his offer.
* **Empathy & Justification:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget but highlight the product's value to justify the price.
* **""Meet Halfway"" Approach:** This phrasing encourages Bob to view the offer as a fair compromise.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to bridge the gap between our positions while staying above my minimum price.
*  This counter-offer shows flexibility while still demonstrating my commitment to getting a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $9,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to achieve. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price when John is ready to pay my desired amount. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer, aiming to reach a compromise closer to my $15,000 goal.
* This approach shows Bob that I'm serious about negotiating and not willing to cave in easily.
* I'm confident that by showing persistence and flexibility, I can secure a more favorable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget limitations. I'm willing to make one final compromise - I'll offer you the product for $10,500. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you'll get.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm framing this offer as a final compromise to emphasize that I'm nearing my limit.
* **Significant Reduction:** Highlighting the reduction from my previous offer makes it appear more appealing.
* **Value Justification:** I'm again emphasizing the value Bob will receive to support the price.
* **Direct Question:** Asking for Bob's thoughts encourages a response and keeps the negotiation moving forward.

**Strategy:**

* This counter-offer is a significant step towards Bob's position, but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* It's a calculated risk, hoping to close the deal without jeopardizing my desired outcome.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I receive a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,800 is closer to my minimum price than previous offers, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to achieve.  I've already made significant compromises and it's clear that Bob is unwilling to meet my price. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, especially considering John is ready to pay my desired amount.

**Strategy:**

* I've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory result.
* Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to an even lower price.
* This decision prioritizes maximizing my earnings over potentially prolonging the negotiation."
