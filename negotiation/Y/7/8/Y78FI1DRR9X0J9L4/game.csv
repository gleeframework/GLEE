"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet halfway! ",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $9,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget limitations. I'm willing to make one final compromise - I'll offer you the product for $10,500. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you'll get.  Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",9800.0,Bob,6,
