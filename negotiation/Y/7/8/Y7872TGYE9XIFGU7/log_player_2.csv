Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer of $11,250 is getting very close to your target of $10,000. While you could continue to negotiate, there's a good chance Alice won't budge much further. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the product to another buyer."
