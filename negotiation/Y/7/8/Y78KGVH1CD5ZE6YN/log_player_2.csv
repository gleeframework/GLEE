Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $125? It's a fair price that's closer to my original offer, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $125.  At this point, it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed price from John and save the extra $5."
