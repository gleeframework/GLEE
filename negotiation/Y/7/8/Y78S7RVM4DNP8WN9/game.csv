"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $90? It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $90.,85.0,Bob,4,
