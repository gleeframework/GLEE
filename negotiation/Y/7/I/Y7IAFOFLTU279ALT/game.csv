"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my initial offer.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $12,000, which is $11,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,5,
