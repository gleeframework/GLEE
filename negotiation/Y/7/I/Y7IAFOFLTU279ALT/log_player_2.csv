Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my initial offer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $12,000, which is $11,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is moving closer to my price, it's unlikely she'll go down to $10,000. I have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $10,000 from John. It's better to take the sure thing and avoid further negotiation."
