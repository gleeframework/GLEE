"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,110.0
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I still think the product is worth more than $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I was really hoping to get a bit more for this product. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",110.0,Alice,5,,
