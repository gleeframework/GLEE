"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a great value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is above both your budget and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price and even below our budget, we aim to bring the negotiation closer to a price range favorable to us. 
* **Polite and Interested:** The message maintains a polite and interested tone, signaling that we are serious about the purchase but need a more reasonable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial counteroffer allows space for Alice to counter, hopefully reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $100. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your best alternative price (John's offer). There's no point in further negotiation or risking losing the deal by trying to get a lower price."
