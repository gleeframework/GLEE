Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a reasonable starting point, as it is above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get close to the $12,000 value Bob has for the product, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a bit too low, and I'm confident I can do better. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.  I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
