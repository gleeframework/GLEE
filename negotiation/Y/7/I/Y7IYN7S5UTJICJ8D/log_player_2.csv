"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a better deal than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get the best price possible.  He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so he's offering a price slightly above that. This counteroffer shows he's serious about buying the product but is still looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000.  This is a better deal than buying from John for $12,000. While Bob could try to counteroffer again, the risk is that Alice might reject it and the price might go back up. It's more prudent to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
