"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1200000 to you, and I believe it has the potential to be a valuable asset.  I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial price.  Would you be interested in an initial offer of $1400000?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1150000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1150000 is a good starting point, it's below my minimum acceptable price. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find common ground at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1250000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still slightly over my budget.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is my absolute maximum. This price reflects the product's value to me while allowing me to stay within my financial constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
