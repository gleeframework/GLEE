Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1150000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
