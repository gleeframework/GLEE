"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $80. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my minimum of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm going to counter with $170.  It's a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum, and it might be tempting enough for Bob to consider given his initial offer of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low.  I'm going to keep trying to negotiate with Bob, hoping to get a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a bit closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping he'll see the value in closing the deal and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not going to budge on his offer. I've already lowered my price significantly, and I don't want to risk going any lower.  It's time to sell the product to John for $150, which is my minimum and ensures I make a profit."
