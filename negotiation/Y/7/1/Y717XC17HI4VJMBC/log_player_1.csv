{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which I believe will be of tremendous value to you.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, reflecting its unique potential.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is beyond my budget for this product. I'm willing to pay $900,000, reflecting the value I see in it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $900,000 is significantly below the value I see in the product.  I believe we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000, a figure that still reflects the significant value of the product for you.  Let's see if we can reach a deal in this round."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $900,000. This reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement this round. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $900,000 is better than his initial offer, it's still below the value I see in the product.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also aware that I can sell the product to John for $1,000,000, which is closer to my desired price.  I'll need to be strategic in my counteroffers to maximize my potential earnings."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer.  I believe this price reflects the value you see in the product while still allowing me to achieve a reasonable return on my investment.  I'm hoping we can close this deal in this round."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us and would allow us to close this transaction.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement in this round. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $925,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I have a few more rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can secure a better deal."
