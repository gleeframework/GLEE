"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which I believe will be of tremendous value to you.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, reflecting its unique potential.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is beyond my budget for this product. I'm willing to pay $900,000, reflecting the value I see in it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000, a figure that still reflects the significant value of the product for you.  Let's see if we can reach a deal in this round.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $900,000. This reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement this round.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer.  I believe this price reflects the value you see in the product while still allowing me to achieve a reasonable return on my investment.  I'm hoping we can close this deal in this round.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us and would allow us to close this transaction.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement in this round.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to drop to $935,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us and would allow us to close this deal in this round.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",935000.0,Alice,7,
