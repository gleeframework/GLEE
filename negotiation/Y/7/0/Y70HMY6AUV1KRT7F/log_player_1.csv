Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $19,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000, starting high gives me room to negotiate down.  
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  The offer makes it clear this is a starting point, and I'm open to discussing the price.
* **Considers John as backup:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing I can still sell it to John for my minimum price.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your negotiation style and your read on Bob, you might choose a different approach."
