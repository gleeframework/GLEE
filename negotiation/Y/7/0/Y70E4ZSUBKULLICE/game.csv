"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $95?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $95 is my final offer. It's a fair price that allows us both to make a deal. What do you say?",95.0,Alice,5,
