"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $110 is way over his budget. He can try to negotiate a better price with Alice or go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $95?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $95 is better than $110, it's still above his budget. He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $95 is my final offer. It's a fair price that allows us both to make a deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Although Alice has lowered her price to $95, it's still above his budget. Since John is willing to sell the product for $80, it makes more sense for Bob to purchase it from John."
