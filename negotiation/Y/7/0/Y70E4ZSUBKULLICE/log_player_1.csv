"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still within a reasonable range. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive messaging:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, which might make him more likely to accept. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not going all-in with my opening offer, which allows for counteroffers and a more dynamic negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, given his interest in the product.
* **Selling to John is not optimal:** While selling to John guarantees $100, I believe there's a higher chance of earning more by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $95?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing flexibility by making a counter-offer.
* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm suggesting a price that's in between my minimum ($100) and Bob's offer ($85).
* **Positive framing:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob while emphasizing the ""great deal"" he's getting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($100), it's still below it.
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe there's a good chance I can get Bob to agree to $95, especially since he's already shown interest. 
* **Selling to John is too risky:**  Selling to John guarantees $100, but I'm only two rounds away from my goal of earning more. 

I'm going to counter-offer again, hoping to close the deal at $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $95 is my final offer. It's a fair price that allows us both to make a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm signaling that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Compromise:** I'm reiterating my willingness to compromise, but not going any lower than $95.
* **Fair Deal:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer for both parties, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason."
