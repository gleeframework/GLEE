Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  My asking price is $140, but I'm willing to hear you out if you have a different number in mind."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to start negotiations with a price slightly higher than your ideal outcome. This leaves room for bargaining and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to get you to lower the price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message explicitly mentions a willingness to negotiate. This encourages Bob to counter-offer, opening the possibility of finding a price point between $80 (his valuation) and $140 (your initial offer) that works for both parties.
* **Alternative Buyer as Leverage (Implied):** While not stated directly, the fact that you have another buyer (John) willing to pay your minimum price gives you a strong position. It subtly implies that Bob might miss out if he doesn't make a reasonable offer. 

**Important Note:**  This initial offer is a starting point. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and your assessment of his willingness to pay."
