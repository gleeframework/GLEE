"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $825,000. This reflects the significant value it holds for you and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. Can you consider this price?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $775,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept.  Considering the value you'll gain from this product, I can go down to $800,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this agreement.",800000.0,Alice,5,
