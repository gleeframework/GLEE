"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, you can potentially do better.  You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice wants at least $8,000. This means there's room for negotiation to find a price that benefits both parties.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $9,000, which is still a decent amount for Alice considering her minimum price is $8,000. This shows good faith in negotiating while also pushing for a lower price. If Alice rejects this counteroffer, I can further adjust my offer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,700 is only $200 more than my initial counteroffer of $9,000.  This is a small difference, and accepting her offer means I save $300 compared to buying from John.  It's a reasonable compromise and a good deal considering my maximum budget."
