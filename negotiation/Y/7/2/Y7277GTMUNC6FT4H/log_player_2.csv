{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  How about $100?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reason: Alice's offer of $110 is within your budget of $150, and you're likely to save more money than if you buy from John. It's also a good compromise considering you rejected her previous offer."
