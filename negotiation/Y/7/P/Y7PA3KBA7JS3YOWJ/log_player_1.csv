``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also reflects the fact that Bob values the product at $8,000, so there's some potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value of $15,000, it's still significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to counteroffer with a higher price and see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to what I need. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,500? I'm really interested in the product and I think it's worth it, but I need to make sure I'm not overspending. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still need to save a bit more. Would you be willing to go down to $9,200? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is still too low for me. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. It's not the ideal outcome, but it's the best I can do given Bob's reluctance to meet my minimum price."
