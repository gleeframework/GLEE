"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's below your maximum price, it's still significantly above the product's value to Alice ($800,000). 
* **Negotiation is worth it:** There's room for negotiation to get a better price. You can likely get the price down closer to Alice's value, saving yourself a substantial amount of money. 
* **John is a fallback:** John's offer is your safety net if negotiations with Alice fail. You'll always have the option to buy from him."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $850,000 is a fair offer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile for me. This would still be a great deal for you, given the product's value to your company.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above the product's value to her and closer to the price you'd pay John. 
* **More negotiation is needed:** There's still room to lower the price further. You can likely get a deal closer to $850,000 or even slightly lower. 
* **John is still a safe option:** You have a safety net with John's offer if negotiations with Alice fall through."
