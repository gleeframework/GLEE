"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth at least that much to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still fair considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
