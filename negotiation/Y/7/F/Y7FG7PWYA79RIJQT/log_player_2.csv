"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $105? That's still a good deal for you, considering what the product is worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  $97.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about $102.50? That's a fair price for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly lowering her price.  At this point, it's unlikely she'll go below $100, which is John's price. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John to guarantee I get the product at the best price."
