"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000 to show you my commitment to a deal.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Can you meet me at that price or is there some flexibility to go lower?",850000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $875,000.  That's a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's fair considering the value of this product. Let's try to find a middle ground to make this deal happen.",875000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $875,000, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $825,000. Can you consider this price?",825000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to move closer to your offer, but $825,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away happy.",850000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, as I mentioned before. Can you consider this price?",825000.0,Bob,6,,
