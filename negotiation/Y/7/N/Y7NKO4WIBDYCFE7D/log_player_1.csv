{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000 to show you my commitment to a deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Can you meet me at that price or is there some flexibility to go lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. While $850,000 is still a good profit, I'm aiming for closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $875,000.  That's a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's fair considering the value of this product. Let's try to find a middle ground to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $875,000, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $825,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $825,000 is a good deal, I'm still confident I can get closer to my minimum of $1,000,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to move closer to your offer, but $825,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, as I mentioned before. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me, and I've already come down a significant amount. It's clear that we're not going to find a middle ground.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  It's a better deal for me, and it ensures I get the minimum I'm willing to accept."
