"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product."", 
""product_price"": 80
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is still a great price for a product worth much more. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4

""product_price"": 100
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $100 is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet at $120? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down on her price, it's clear she's unlikely to go as low as $100. You have a guaranteed option with John at your target price. It makes more sense to take the sure thing than risk further negotiation with Alice."
