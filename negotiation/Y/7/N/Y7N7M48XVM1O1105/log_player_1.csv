{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $100, but it's still less than the $150 you could get from John. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring you make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Could we possibly agree on a price closer to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what you could get from John. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob, as you may be able to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I can still make a profit."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to go above $110 for this product. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $110 is closer to your minimum price of $150, it's still not a great deal for you. You're better off selling to John and securing the $150, as it's highly likely that Bob will not offer you anything closer to your desired price point."
