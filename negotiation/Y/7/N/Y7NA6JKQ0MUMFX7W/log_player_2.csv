"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $8,000 to you, and Alice's offer is $9,500. This is significantly more than your maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since I am aiming to save as much money as possible, I am starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  $7,500 is still a good deal for me, as it's below my maximum budget.  This counteroffer should hopefully initiate a back-and-forth negotiation, allowing me to land on a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, I still want to try and negotiate a better price. $8,500 is still $500 more than I'm willing to pay. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. I am willing to pay the product's worth to me, but I'm not going any higher. Hopefully, Alice will accept this offer, as it's also what the product is worth to her. If she rejects it, I will buy from John."
