Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $950,000 price point. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to $700,000? This would allow me to consider the purchase without straining my resources. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $700,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise a bit further.
