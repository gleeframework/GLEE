"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $9,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
