"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $115. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $100 to you.  Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $110?  I'm confident you'll still get a good deal at that price.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? Can you do that?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $107.50.  Let's try $110 again.  It's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're sticking to your price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $107.50. Can you meet me at $108? It's a small concession, but it's the most I can do.",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to budge a little more, but $108 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $109? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would be a great deal for you.",109.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, but I still think $108 is a fair price. Can you meet me at that price or do I need to explore other options?",108.0,Bob,8,
