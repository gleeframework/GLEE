Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite below its true value. I could meet you halfway at $16,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product brings. What do you say?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $13,500? I think that's a fair offer considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value here, and I appreciate that. $13,500 is close, but I need to be closer to $15,000 for this to make sense for me.  How about we split the difference and call it $14,250? "",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, we're getting close! I understand you need to be around $15,000.  What if we do $14,000? That's a firm offer from me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

While getting $15,000 from John is ideal, Bob's offer of $14,000 is strong enough. Accepting now avoids the risk of the negotiation failing and ensures a good profit."
