"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to $1,300,000 for this to work. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,075,000? ",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for continuing the negotiation. I'm willing to move a bit further to reach a deal. How about we split the difference at $1,112,500? This feels like a fair compromise to me.",1112500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  To be honest,  $1,100,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
