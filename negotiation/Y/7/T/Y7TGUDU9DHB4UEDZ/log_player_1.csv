"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high with $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, and hopefully encourages Bob to engage. I'm also aware of my minimum value ($15,000) and will adjust my offers accordingly if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's significantly less than my minimum value, and I'm confident I can get more. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm countering with $17,000. It's still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not giving away the product for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll continue negotiating in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $15,000, which is my minimum value.  Since Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate upward, I believe this will be attractive enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired profit margin.  I've already lowered my offer to my absolute minimum, and it seems like Bob is not willing to go any higher.  It's better to sell to John at this point and ensure a guaranteed profit."
