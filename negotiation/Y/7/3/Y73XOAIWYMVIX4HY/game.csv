"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the value I see in the product, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $920,000. This is my final offer, so I'd appreciate it if you could let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $920,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer $880,000. If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal. ",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $880,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $900,000. This is my last offer, so I'd like to hear from you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
