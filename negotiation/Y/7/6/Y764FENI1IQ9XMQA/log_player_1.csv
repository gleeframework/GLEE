Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $60 is quite low for the value this product provides.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $110 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Would you consider $80? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my $100 minimum. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price without further negotiation."
