"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $13,500. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is a good deal, you can potentially save more money by rejecting and counter-offering.  Alice values the product at $12,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $13,000? It's a great compromise and I think you'll still get a lot of value out of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price. While you could continue to counteroffer, there's a risk that she'll become unwilling to negotiate further, forcing you to either buy from John for a higher price or walk away entirely. Accepting Alice's offer at $13,000 is a good compromise that saves you $500 compared to buying from John."
