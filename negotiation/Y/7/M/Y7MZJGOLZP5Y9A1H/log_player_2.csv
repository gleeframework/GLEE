"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price of $1400000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You are looking to save as much money as possible and buying from John for $1,500,000 is already your fallback option. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering its value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is still a very good price for you, considering the value of the product, and it's closer to my minimum. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation. You can aim for a lower price, and it's worth trying to push for a better deal before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm confident we can reach a deal at $1,325,000. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close this deal today."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
