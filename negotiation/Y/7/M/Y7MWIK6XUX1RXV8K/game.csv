"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $11,000? This is still a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. ",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. However, $9,500 still isn't quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250.  This would be a great deal for you and a fair price for me. Let's make this happen!",10250.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not sure $9,750 reflects the true value of this product for you.  I'm willing to make one final compromise. Let's settle on $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,7,
