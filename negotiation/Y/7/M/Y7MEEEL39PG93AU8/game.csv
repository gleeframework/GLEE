"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $10,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,4,
