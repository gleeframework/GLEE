"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, there's potential to save even more.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore if he can get a lower price from Alice through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by significantly lowering the price, demonstrating Bob's desire for a good deal.  It's a bold move, but leaves room for compromise should Alice reject it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $900,000 and is within Bob's budget.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal with Alice and being forced to buy from John for a much higher price.  Accepting the offer secures a good deal for Bob."
