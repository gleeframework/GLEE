Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than his perceived value, giving me room to negotiate. It's also below the price I'd get from John, ensuring I don't immediately lose out on a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I will reject Bob's offer of $90. While it's better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $120. I can likely secure a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a compromise, coming down from my previous offer of $110, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $90. I believe this offer is fair and might persuade Bob to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $92. While it's slightly better than his previous offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $120. I'm confident I can achieve a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $98.  This is a small concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's close enough to Bob's offer that he might be willing to accept. It also still keeps me above my minimum acceptable value of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  Bob's offer of $88 is too far below my minimum acceptable value, and it's unlikely I can push him much higher.  I'm better off taking the guaranteed $120 from John."
