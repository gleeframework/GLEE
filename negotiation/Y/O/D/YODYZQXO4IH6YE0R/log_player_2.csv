"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is way too high. It is better to reject it and make a counteroffer or buy the product from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you is $12,000, and it's still a good profit for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my preferred price, it's still above my maximum budget of $12,000.  I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further or consider buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I understand that $14,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $15,500. This is a fair price, considering its value to you is $12,000, and it's getting close to my minimum target. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above my maximum budget of $12,000.  Since I can buy the product from John for $12,000, I'll go with that option. It's the most cost-effective choice for me."
