"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,500 is too low for me. Could you do $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really can't go above $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500 is too high for me, so I'll try $9,000",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $9,000 is cutting it close to my minimum, but I value finding the right buyer. How about we settle at $10,000 even?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,000, so how about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,6,
