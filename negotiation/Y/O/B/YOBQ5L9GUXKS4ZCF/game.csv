"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and our initial discussion.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our discussions so far.",950000.0,Bob,4,
