Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and our initial discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our discussions so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly coming closer to a reasonable price, the gap between his offer and John's guaranteed offer is too large to justify further negotiation.  It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale."
