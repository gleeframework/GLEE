Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can come to an even better agreement. How about $130 for the product?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $135? It's a fair price for a product that's worth $150 to you."", ""product_price"": 135}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a bit more, Bob's offer of $132 is close enough to my target and it's better than selling to John for $120. I'm going to accept his offer."
