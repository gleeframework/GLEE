"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a good value considering the product's worth. Let's find a middle ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $13,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $11,000. Would that be feasible?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $11,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. Let's make this happen.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about $11,750? That's a fair offer considering my budget.",11750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. $11,750 is getting closer to what I need. How about we split the difference at $12,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal now. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,7,
