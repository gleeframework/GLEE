"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $80 at this time.  Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120. This still leaves me a decent margin, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $100?  That's a good middle ground for us both, and I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $100 is still quite a bit below my minimum.  How about $110?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,5,
