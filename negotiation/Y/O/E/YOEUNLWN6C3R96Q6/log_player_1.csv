"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's really valuable to me. I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation and increases my chances of getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to come down to $160, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're getting closer to my asking price, but $140 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference.  I'll go down to $150, which is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. While I could continue negotiating, time is running out. I've reached my limit with Bob, and I'm not confident that I can get a better price from him. It's best to take the guaranteed $150 from John and secure the sale."
