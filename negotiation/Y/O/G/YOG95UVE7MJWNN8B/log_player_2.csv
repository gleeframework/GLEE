Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 930000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now $985,000. We're nearing a critical point in the negotiation.  This counteroffer is a compromise - closer to Alice's price, but still offering a significant saving compared to John's price. With only 4 rounds left, it's important to close the deal quickly.  Alice is likely to accept this offer, as she has already moved closer to your price."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the last 3 rounds and Alice's offer is now $995,000.  It's unlikely you'll be able to get a significantly lower price in the remaining rounds, and you're risking missing out on the product altogether.  It's better to buy from John at this point, even though it's a slightly higher price, to guarantee you get the product."
