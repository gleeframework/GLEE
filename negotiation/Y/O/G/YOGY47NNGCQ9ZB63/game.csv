"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13000 is still a bit high for me. How about $11500? I'm really interested in this product, and I believe this price is fair considering the value we both see in it.",11500.0,Bob,4,
