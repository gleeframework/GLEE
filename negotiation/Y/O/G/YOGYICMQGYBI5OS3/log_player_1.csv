{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** $12,000 is well above your $8,000 minimum, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's within Bob's range:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so $12,000 is a reasonable price for him to consider.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can lower the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers, maximizing your chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

While $10,000 is a good deal, it's still within the range where I can likely get more. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $11,000?  That would still give you a good value considering how much you value the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $10,500 is very close to my initial counteroffer of $11,000.  It's also significantly better than selling to John for $8,000.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
