"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's get started with a price of $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to both reach an agreement. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe you'll find it a reasonable compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer, but I'm still not willing to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
