Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to both reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
