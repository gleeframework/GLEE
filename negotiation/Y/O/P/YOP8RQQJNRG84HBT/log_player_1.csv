{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low. It is worth $120 to him, so he is trying to get a very good deal. I will counteroffer with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 is my final offer.  It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 125}
