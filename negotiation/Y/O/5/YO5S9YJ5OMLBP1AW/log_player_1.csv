"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good starting point. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $100, as it's below my minimum value. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer, but still staying above my minimum value. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, and we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value. Although it's not ideal, it's better than selling to John for $120. I'm accepting his offer to avoid risking further rounds and potentially ending up with a lower price."
