Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product, which I value very highly.  Given its potential, I believe a price of $950,000 is more than fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have another interested buyer."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed offer from John, my goal is to get the highest possible price. Bob's perceived value of $800,000 gives me a starting point for negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering a price slightly below my guaranteed sale price ($1,000,000) creates a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $950,000 offer allows some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. However, it still ensures a significant profit above his perceived value. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning another buyer subtly introduces a deadline, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly."
