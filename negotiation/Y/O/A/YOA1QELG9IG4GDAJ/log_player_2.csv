"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great interest to you. It's something I value at no less than $10,000, and I believe it holds the same value for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. Let me know if you're interested! If you decline, I have another buyer lined up at $10,000, so this is your chance to secure it for a slightly higher price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price, knowing you have an alternative buyer. While her message aims to create urgency, you have a better option: John offers the product at its true value to Alice ($10,000). Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to proceed with buying from John and save $1,000."
