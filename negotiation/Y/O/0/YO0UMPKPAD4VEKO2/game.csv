"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. Can you consider it?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. Can you consider it?",850000.0,Bob,4,
