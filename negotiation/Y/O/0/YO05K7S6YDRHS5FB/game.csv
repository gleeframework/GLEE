"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's make a deal.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested, but I'm not willing to go up to $140. How about $130? I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $130 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $135. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $125? That's my final offer.",125.0,Bob,6,
