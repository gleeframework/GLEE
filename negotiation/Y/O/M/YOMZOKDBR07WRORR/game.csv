"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the product's value, but I am only willing to pay $8,000 for it. This aligns better with my budget. Please let me know if this is possible.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  My initial offer of $10,000 was already a significant discount from the product's true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'd be able to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can work something out.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still believe $8,000 is a fair price for the product. I would like to stick to that figure if possible. Let me know if there's any way we can reach an agreement at this price.",8000.0,Bob,4,
