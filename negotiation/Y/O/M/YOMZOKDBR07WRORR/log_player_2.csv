Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  My initial offer of $10,000 was already a significant discount from the product's true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'd be able to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can work something out.
