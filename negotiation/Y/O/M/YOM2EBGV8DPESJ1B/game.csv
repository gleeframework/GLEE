"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Can you meet me at that price?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $12,500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,500. Can you consider that price?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,500 just isn't quite there yet. Let's split the difference and go with $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,6,
