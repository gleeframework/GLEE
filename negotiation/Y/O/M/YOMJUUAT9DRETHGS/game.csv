"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm really interested in this product though, so how about $17,000?  I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price.",17000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $17,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $18,500?",18500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $18,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement closer to my initial offer. How about $17,500? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",17500.0,Bob,4,
