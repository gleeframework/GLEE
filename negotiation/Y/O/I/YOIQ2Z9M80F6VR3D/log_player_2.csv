# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the market value of the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

* Even though it's higher than Alice's value, it allows you to achieve your goal of buying the product while saving a substantial amount of money."
