"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product.  This offer reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for both of us to come to a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $950000 is a bit lower than what I was initially thinking, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1025000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I place on the product, while also giving you a good deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1025000 is closer to my target price, I'm still aiming for a bit lower to make this deal truly work for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and represents a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1075000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
