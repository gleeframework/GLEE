I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $750,000 is too low, and I believe I can get a better deal.  I will counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
