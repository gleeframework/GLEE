"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially worth far more than my asking price. I'm initially suggesting $1,300,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  A counteroffer will allow Bob to try and get a better price.  The goal is to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the initial offer keeps that option open."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While that number is a bit low for me to accept, I'm willing to move closer to your offer to get this deal done. How about we land at $1,175,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above the $1,000,000 counteroffer. Bob should continue negotiating to try and lower the price even further. There's still room to find a middle ground."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $1,087,500 is tempting, I'm holding out for something closer to my desired outcome.  Would you consider $1,131,250?  This demonstrates my commitment to finding a middle ground, while ensuring the deal remains worthwhile for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,131,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,131,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,131,250 is still a bit higher than Bob's last counteroffer, but it's getting very close. It's important to remember that Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, but also to secure the product. At this point, further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price significantly lower than John's, and it's within a reasonable range of his desired price."
