# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see the potential value, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
