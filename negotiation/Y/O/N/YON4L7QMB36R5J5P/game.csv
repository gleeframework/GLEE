"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially worth far more than my asking price. I'm initially suggesting $1,300,000. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see the potential value, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While that number is a bit low for me to accept, I'm willing to move closer to your offer to get this deal done. How about we land at $1,175,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,175,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,087,500?  This represents a significant step towards a mutually agreeable price, and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1087500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $1,087,500 is tempting, I'm holding out for something closer to my desired outcome.  Would you consider $1,131,250?  This demonstrates my commitment to finding a middle ground, while ensuring the deal remains worthwhile for me.",1131250.0,Alice,5,
