"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value. Let's see if we can close the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

This is my final offer in this range, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
