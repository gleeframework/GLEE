"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He is willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice's offer is significantly higher.  There is no reason to accept this offer when he has a better alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000, so a counteroffer of $12,000 is a reasonable starting point. It leaves some room for negotiation, but also demonstrates that Bob is serious about buying the product at a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $16,500 is closer to his maximum price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. Since he has a guaranteed alternative with John, there's no reason to accept this offer yet.  He should counteroffer again to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000, so this counteroffer of $14,000 is a good compromise.  It is still a good deal for him, and it shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product, but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum price.  He has a guaranteed option to buy from John for $15,000, which is the best option for him at this point.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice, as she seems unwilling to drop her price significantly."
