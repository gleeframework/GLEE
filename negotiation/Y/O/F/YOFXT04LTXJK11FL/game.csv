"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd be willing to make a serious offer, but I need to feel confident that it's within my means.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budgetary constraints, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000? I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, I'm willing to come down slightly further. How about we settle on $980,000? This reflects a significant discount on my initial asking price and ensures you acquire a truly valuable asset.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $980,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $960,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the deal.",960000.0,Bob,6,
