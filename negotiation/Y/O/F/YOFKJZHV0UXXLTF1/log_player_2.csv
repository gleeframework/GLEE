Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still far below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's try $1,250,000.

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still far too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,100,000. This would allow us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?
