"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product at a price of $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,750,000 is unfortunately out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still far below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's try $1,250,000. This would give you a good deal, and it would be closer to the value you've mentioned.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This is a significant step for me, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still far too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,100,000. This would allow us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be realistic here. $1,100,000 is still too much for me. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still not enough.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to accept it, I'll need to explore other options.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
