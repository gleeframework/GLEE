"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I have to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,400. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know what you think.",7400.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $7,400 is getting closer to what I'm hoping to pay, I'm still a little higher than my target.  I'd like to offer $7,300.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",7300.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your target, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $7,350. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know what you think.",7350.0,Alice,5,
