# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that I believe will be a significant benefit to your business. My asking price is $1,000,000.  This represents a considerable saving for you, given its value to you.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that's mutually beneficial.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal."
