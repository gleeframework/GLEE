"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $85 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. This is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $120 is still too high. I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this happen.  However, $95 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good value for you.  Let's work together to close this deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still stuck at $100. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",100.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to drop my price to $105.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great price for you considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",105.0,Alice,7,
