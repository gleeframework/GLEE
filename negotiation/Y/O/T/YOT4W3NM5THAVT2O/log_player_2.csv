Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get at least $150 for this product.  It's a final offer - do we have a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

* Alice has come down to her lowest acceptable price of $150. 
* This matches the price offered by John. 
* Continuing to negotiate might not yield any further discounts and could risk losing the deal."
