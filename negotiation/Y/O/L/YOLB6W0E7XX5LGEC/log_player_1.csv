{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring I get a good starting point.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product to encourage a positive response.
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving room for negotiation, ready to counteroffer if Bob doesn't accept. 
* **Plan B:** Having John as a backup ensures I'm not pressured to accept a low price if Bob proves difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.**  While closer, it's not a deal I'm willing to close on immediately.
* **I have a strong backup option with John.**  This allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob, knowing I won't be stuck if he doesn't come up to my desired price.
* **I believe I can get a better price.** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that bridges the gap. It's likely Bob is willing to go higher than $900,000, given he initially offered to pay $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price but not going below my minimum threshold. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm still reminding Bob of the product's worth and potential to strengthen his business.
* **Closing the Gap:** This offer is closer to Bob's offer while still leaving room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the conversation positive and encouraging Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $950,000, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $925,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **I have a strong backup option with John.**  This allows me to continue pushing for a higher price.
* **Negotiation is a two-way street:** Bob is showing some flexibility, so I can continue to counteroffer to bridge the gap further.

**Counteroffer Strategy:** 

In the next round, I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, perhaps $935,000, and highlight the value of the product to convince him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $925,000.  While I value your interest, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the true value of this product.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm increasing the price by only $10,000, demonstrating flexibility while maintaining a firm stance. 
* **Emphasis on Compromise:**  I'm framing the offer as a mutual benefit, showing that I'm willing to meet in the middle. 
* **Final Push:** This is likely to be my final counteroffer before resorting to selling to John.  I'm hoping this small increase will convince Bob to close the deal.
* **Positive Language:** I'm staying friendly and optimistic to encourage a positive response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Stalemate:** Bob's final offer of $920,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome for me.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would take time and effort, and there's no guarantee that he'll come up to my desired price.
* **Secure a Higher Price:** Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price of $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than anything Bob is offering.
* **Moving On:**  I'm choosing to move on to a deal that guarantees my desired profit instead of risking a lower sale price with Bob."
