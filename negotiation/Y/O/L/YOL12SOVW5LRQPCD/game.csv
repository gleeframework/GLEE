"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a high-value item, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you and the price I'm willing to accept.",875000.0,Alice,3,
