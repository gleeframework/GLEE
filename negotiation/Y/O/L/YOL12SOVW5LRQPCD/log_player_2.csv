"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a high-value item, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's true value to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you and the price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is still within Bob's budget of $800,000. 
* While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject his next offer and he'd be forced to buy from John at the higher price. 
* Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to secure the product for a price that is still a significant savings compared to John's offer."
