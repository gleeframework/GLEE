Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're serious about closing the deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much value.

Alice is clearly very reluctant to go below $910,000. While we might be able to squeeze out a few thousand more in further rounds, the difference is getting small enough that it's probably not worth the risk of her pulling out or the time investment. Accepting at $915,000 secures a good deal."
