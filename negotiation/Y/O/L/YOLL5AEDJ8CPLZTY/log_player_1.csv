Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to hopefully make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer. I know my ""floor"" is $15,000 with John, but I'm hoping to get closer to that with Bob if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I need to try to get closer to that value. 
* **Opportunity for Counter-Offer:**  I'm confident I can get a better price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counter-offer and try to bridge the gap. 
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing I have John's offer for $15,000 gives me a strong bargaining position.  I can afford to be more assertive in negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,000 is a bit too far below what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $8,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price.
* **Fairness and Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair deal for both of us, emphasizing that we're both getting a good outcome.
* **Avoiding a Stalemate:**  I want to avoid getting stuck in a back-and-forth negotiation that might lead to a stalemate or force me to sell to John."
