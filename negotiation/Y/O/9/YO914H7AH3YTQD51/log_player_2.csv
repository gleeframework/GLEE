It's way too expensive.  Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,200,000 is far too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering the product's worth, and it gives us both some room to agree. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

$1,050,000 is still too high. I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a reasonable compromise. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and $950,000 is a tempting offer. However, considering the value of the product, I can only accept a price of $975,000. This is a very small difference, and it allows us to close the deal without compromising too much. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

$975,000 is a good price, and it's worth closing the deal with Alice instead of going with John."
