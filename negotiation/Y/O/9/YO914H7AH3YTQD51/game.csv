"Alice, $1,200,000 is far too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  What do you say?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering the product's worth, and it gives us both some room to agree. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a reasonable compromise. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and $950,000 is a tempting offer. However, considering the value of the product, I can only accept a price of $975,000. This is a very small difference, and it allows us to close the deal without compromising too much. What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
