"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident this price reflects the product's true worth and will be a great investment for you."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High initial offer:** I'm starting with a high price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm framing the offer as an opportunity and highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I'm leaving some room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open. 

This strategy aims to set a high baseline while leaving open the possibility of a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $1,400,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum value. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation process and potentially reach a more acceptable price. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a viable option, but I want to see if I can secure a higher price from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but it's significantly below my minimum value.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a price closer to $1,750,000 to make this work for me. This price still allows for a profit for you while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment.  Let's find common ground and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer to show I'm listening and willing to negotiate.
* **Counter with a higher price:**  My counteroffer is closer to my minimum value but still leaves room for compromise.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I emphasize the potential for profit for Bob while also highlighting my need for a fair return. 
* **Call for compromise:** I invite Bob to find a middle ground to close the deal.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap while maintaining my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions. Thank you for considering my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's a good compromise and allows me to secure a profit while still closing the deal.  While I could potentially continue negotiating and try to get a higher price, there's no guarantee that I'd succeed, and I risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a good price for my product and avoids any further risk."
