"Bob, I understand your offer, but it's significantly below my minimum value.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a price closer to $1,750,000 to make this work for me. This price still allows for a profit for you while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment.  Let's find common ground and make this deal happen.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
