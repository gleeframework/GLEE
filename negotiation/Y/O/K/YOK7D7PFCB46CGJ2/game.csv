"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the price, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Would you consider meeting me halfway?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still unable to meet at $9,000. I would like to propose $8,500 as my maximum offer. I hope this is within your acceptable range.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $8,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",8750.0,Alice,5,
