Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $950,000. This is still a good deal for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $925,000. This price reflects the value of the product and also allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can come to a final agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but $925,000 is still above my target price of $800,000. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating. There's still room for compromise and I want to see if I can push for a price that's closer to my limit."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $910,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering we both want to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 910000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're both getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $915,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my target price, I've already reached the point where it's more beneficial to purchase the product from John for $800,000.  I'm not confident that I can get Alice down to my desired price within the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out on the opportunity to secure the product at a lower price with John."
