Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential benefits to you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a range favorable to Alice.
* **Time Value of Money:**  While John guarantees $800,000, a quicker sale to Bob at a higher price might be more advantageous overall. 

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice has no way of knowing with absolute certainty that Bob values the product at $1,000,000. If she had more information or leverage, the offer might change."
