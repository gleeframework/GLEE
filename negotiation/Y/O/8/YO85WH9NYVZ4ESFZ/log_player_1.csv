Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $150, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Showing willingness to negotiate:** I'm stating that I'm open to discussing a fair price to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to counteroffer.
* **Positive and friendly tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd be willing to pay $120 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No room for further negotiation:** While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'd be left with selling to John at the same price. 
* **Time is valuable:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and minimizes the time spent negotiating."
