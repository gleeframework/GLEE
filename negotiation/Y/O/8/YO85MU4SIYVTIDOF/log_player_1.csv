Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $85 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $90? It's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $82? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $82 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hopeful that I can get a bit more.  I'm confident I can get a better deal than selling to John, so I'll continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your persistence, but $82 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to stay above $85. Let's meet in the middle at $87.50. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $87.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $86? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, I've already rejected several offers from Bob.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing him altogether, and selling to John would be less profitable.  $86 is a good deal, and I'm confident I can make a profit from this sale."
