"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it would be a fantastic addition to your portfolio, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth seeing if we can get a better deal from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your offer, the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. I believe this price point reflects the value it would bring you while still being a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than I want to pay.  I'm going to continue to negotiate and see if we can reach a price closer to my ideal range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  I'm still hoping to get the price lower.  I'm willing to offer $975,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, and I want to find a solution that works for us both. Let's settle this at $1,012,500. This is a very competitive price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, but it's getting close. I've already made a few counteroffers and it seems like she's willing to negotiate.  If I reject this offer, I risk having her counter with a price higher than John's, and I don't want to risk losing out on the deal completely.  

At $1,012,500, I'm still saving $187,500 compared to buying from John, so accepting this offer is the best option at this point."
