""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you and am willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a limited-time offer."",
""product_price"": 925000 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation downwards if Bob counters. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to accept without overthinking.

**Why this price:**

* **Midpoint:**  $925,000 is roughly halfway between Bob's valuation ($1,000,000) and your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Significant Profit:** This price point nets you a $125,000 profit, which is substantial.

**Important:**  While John provides a safety net, the goal is to maximize profit with Bob."
