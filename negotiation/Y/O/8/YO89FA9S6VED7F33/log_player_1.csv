"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in my product.  I'm confident it holds immense value for you. I'm offering it for $2,200,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Opening:** Starting significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This high initial offer helps gauge how eager Bob is to buy. A strong reaction (positive or negative) gives you valuable information.
* **Justification:** The message frames the price as a starting point and emphasizes the product's value, making it seem less like an arbitrary high number.
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping John's offer in mind provides a safety net. If Bob's counter-offers are too low, you can always walk away and accept John's $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request, Alice. After careful consideration, I believe the product's true value lies closer to $1,800,000. I hope this offer aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is already $300,000 more than your minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. 
* **Negotiating Room:** There are still 8 rounds left, providing ample time to negotiate a better price.
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, you can make a strategic counter-offer that keeps the negotiation moving while aiming higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, my initial assessment of the product's worth remains firm.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,000,000.  I believe this price reflects the unique benefits and potential the product offers you."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Movement:**  Showing flexibility by reducing the price from $2,200,000 to $2,000,000 demonstrates willingness to negotiate.
* **Holding Firm:** The reduction is relatively small, signaling that you are serious about a price above $1,800,000.
* **Reiterating Value:** The message emphasizes the product's unique benefits to Bob, subtly reinforcing the higher price point. 
* **Open for Discussion:** The tone remains open and collaborative, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my research and understanding of the market, I would like to propose a price of $1,900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Trajectory:**  Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating he's serious about buying and willing to negotiate. 
* **Significant Profit:** Even though Bob's offer is still below your initial ask, $1,900,000 is a $400,000 profit over your minimum and John's offer.
* **Time Advantage:**  With 6 rounds remaining, you have time to counter-offer strategically and potentially push the price closer to your initial target. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While accepting Bob's offer guarantees a good profit, there's a reasonable chance to secure an even better deal with careful negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I value your willingness to find common ground. To meet you halfway, I'm prepared to offer the product at $1,950,000. This feels like a fair price that reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By offering $1,950,000, you're meeting Bob exactly in the middle of the last round of offers ($1,900,000 from Bob and $2,000,000 from you). This classic negotiation tactic often feels fair and agreeable to both parties.
* **Strong Position:** While you're conceding slightly, you're still holding a strong position. The offer is significantly above your minimum and John's offer.
* **Urgency:** Offering a compromise at this stage subtly introduces a sense of urgency. With the rounds passing, Bob might be more inclined to accept a reasonable offer rather than risk the deal falling through. 
* **Positive Language:**  Continuing with positive language about ""common ground"" and ""fair price"" maintains a collaborative and agreeable atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've done some further analysis and believe that $1,900,000 would be a fair price for the product given its current condition and market value. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,900,000 is a substantial profit, exceeding your minimum and John's offer by $400,000.
* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob has repeated his previous offer, indicating potential resistance to going higher.
* **Time Consideration:** With only 4 rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob without a guarantee of a significantly better offer.
* **Bird in Hand:** Accepting the current offer secures a very good outcome, while prolonged negotiation introduces uncertainty."
