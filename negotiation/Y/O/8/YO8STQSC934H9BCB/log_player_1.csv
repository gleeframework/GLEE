Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $149.  I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 149}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $150 as possible since she has a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting high leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, even if it's just a small amount. 
* **Urgency:** The ""limited time"" phrase might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.

While Bob might reject this offer, it gives Alice the best chance to get a price closer to her minimum acceptable value. If Bob rejects it, she can always fall back on selling to John."
