Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product for you.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 90}
