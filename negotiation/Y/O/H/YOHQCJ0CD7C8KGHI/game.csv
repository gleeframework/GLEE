"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me, and still a good value for you. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This would still be a good deal for you, and allows me to get closer to my target price.  Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,3,
