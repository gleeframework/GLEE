Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $9500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $10,500 for this. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still hesitant to accept it. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for $10,000 just yet. I'll continue negotiating to try and get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to go down to $11,000, but I really need to get at least that much for this product. It's a good deal for both of us, as it's still below what the product is worth to me. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Alice. Considering the value of the product and our negotiation history, I would like to propose a price of $10750.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to settle for less than $11,000.  There are still a few rounds left, and I believe I can push for a slightly higher price.  I'm not yet willing to sell to John, as I think I can get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference and settle on $10,875.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal on the product.  I hope we can reach an agreement on this final offer."", ""product_price"": 10875} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort in coming down to $10875. Considering the value of the product and our previous negotiations, I would like to propose a price of $10700. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Bob's offer is getting closer to my target price but still below my minimum desired price of $11,000.  There is a chance we can continue negotiating, but the risk is that we will run out of rounds and I will end up with a price lower than I am willing to accept.  To avoid this, I will sell to John for $15,000 to guarantee I reach my minimum desired price."
