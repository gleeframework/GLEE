"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to go down to $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $108.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $108 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get a little more.  How about we meet at $110?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to cover my costs.  What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
