,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000.  This is my final offer.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but I'm still not convinced that $1,275,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,225,000. That's the highest I'm willing to pay.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
