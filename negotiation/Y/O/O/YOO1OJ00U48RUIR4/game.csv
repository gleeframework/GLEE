"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me there?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I can't go as low as $90, I'm willing to come down to $105. This would be a great deal for you and gives me a price I'm happy with. Let's make this happen.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $105. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $97.50 is still quite a bit lower than my minimum price. How about we settle at $100? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the sale.",100.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can we meet at $97.50? It's the best I can do, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price.",97.5,Bob,6,
