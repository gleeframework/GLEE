Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle!

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $90, and I know the product is worth $80 to her, I'll try to meet her halfway and make a counteroffer of $87.50. This should be a fair price for both of us.
