"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $11000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $8000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11000, but I'm still a bit too far apart. I'm willing to go up to $9000. This is still a good deal for you, considering you value the product at $10000. Let's try to find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,
