"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $100? ",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a budget, Bob! However, I really need to make a profit on this sale. I can do $120, which is the lowest I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $120 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $110, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I can meet you halfway between $110 and $120, which is $115. That's the best I can do.",115.0,Alice,5,
