"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it looks great, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly less than its value. Let's meet in the middle - how about $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $14,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could we settle around $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm trying to find a fair price here. $9,500 is still quite low for what I can offer it for elsewhere.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but I need to be around the $10,000 mark.  Would you consider $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,6,
