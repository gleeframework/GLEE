"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? Is this something you'd be interested in?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I agree this product has great potential. However, I have a slightly different budget in mind. Would you be willing to consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $800,000. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, Alice.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to my initial counteroffer.  Would you be open to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more move. I'm not comfortable going all the way to $850,000, but I can do $875,000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to make a deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",875000.0,Alice,5,
