Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $160. This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value of $150. I believe this price gives me some room to negotiate while still being within the range of what Bob might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $130. While it's closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I consider the product to be worth. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $145. This is a compromise between my previous offer and his counteroffer. It's still above my minimum value, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  Bob's counteroffer of $135 is still too low for me.  While I could continue to negotiate, John's offer guarantees me my minimum value and allows me to avoid further negotiations."
