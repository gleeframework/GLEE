"I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go over $8,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I can do $11,000, which is the lowest I can go. This is a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your need to make a profit and my budget limitations. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000, so I'll offer you $10,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
