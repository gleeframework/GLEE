"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice,  $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
