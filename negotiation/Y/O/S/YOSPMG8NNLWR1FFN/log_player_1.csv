Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than your minimum, but still lower than the product's perceived value to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you're still getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $850,000. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $900,000?  It's a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am unable to meet you at $900,000. I would like to counter with an offer of $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to sell for closer to my initial offer, Bob's offer of $875,000 is only slightly lower than what John would pay.  At this point, it's more profitable to accept Bob's offer rather than risk a further decrease in price or going through another round of negotiation."
