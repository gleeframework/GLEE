"Hi Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product.  While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $10,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  $7,500 is still a little lower than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,5,
