"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. It's valued at $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and inviting tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm subtly emphasizing the product's value to me, suggesting it's a good deal for Bob. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  The $12,000 price allows for potential counteroffers and negotiation without dropping below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell for such a low amount. I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product.  While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $12,000 to $10,000, showing flexibility.  
* **Highlight Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's worth to remind Bob of its potential value to him.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging further negotiation. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm still above my minimum, leaving space for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $10,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a price that's more acceptable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  $7,500 is still a little lower than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price again, but still staying above my minimum.
* **Fairness Argument:** I'm reminding Bob that this is a good deal for him based on the product's value.
* **Encouraging Agreement:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to reach an agreement.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation, as Bob might be willing to come up a little more."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for working with me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $8,500. This is my final offer. It's a fair price that allows me to get a good deal while ensuring you get good value for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is finally above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer, and I'm running out of rounds.  

* **Time is of the Essence:**  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation process, and I need to make a decision.
* **Potential for Loss:** If I reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, there's a risk he might walk away, leaving me with no deal. 
* **Safe Haven:** Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but accepting Bob's offer is a better deal right now, even if it's not the ideal outcome."
