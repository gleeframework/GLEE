"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. It's valued at $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. It's important to negotiate a significantly lower price to get closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, I'm aiming to create room for negotiation and signal my budget constraints clearly. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** While $6,000 is much lower than Alice's valuation, it provides a basis for discussion and potential counteroffers.
* **Polite and Direct:**  The message maintains a friendly tone while clearly stating my price expectations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product.  While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  Alice's counteroffer is a step in the right direction, but $10,000 is still significantly higher than my $8,000 maximum budget and John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to lower her price suggests there's room for further negotiation. I need to keep pushing to see how low she's willing to go. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing that I have John's offer of $8,000 as a backup gives me leverage in the negotiation with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $10,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Steady Increase:** My counteroffer of $7,500 shows Alice that I'm willing to increase my price, but I'm doing so incrementally.
* **Compromise:**  This offer is closer to the midpoint between our previous offers, signaling that I'm looking for a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Urgency:**  By nudging the price closer to my limit, I'm adding a touch of urgency to the negotiation while still leaving room for one more round, if necessary, before considering John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  $7,500 is still a little lower than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching the Limit:** While $9,000 is the closest Alice has gotten to my budget, it's still $1,000 over what John is offering.
* **Final Push:**  I'll use my last counteroffer to try and meet in the middle between $8,000 and $9,000. If Alice doesn't budge, I'll go with John's offer. 
* **Leverage:**  Alice knows I'm interested, but she also knows time is running out and I have an alternative option."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for working with me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $8,500. This is my final offer. It's a fair price that allows me to get a good deal while ensuring you get good value for the product."",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer makes it clear to Alice that this is as high as I'm willing to go. 
* **Middle Ground:**  $8,500 is a strong compromise,  splitting the difference between her last offer and my budget.
* **Time Pressure:**  By presenting this as my final offer, I'm adding a level of urgency and encouraging Alice to make a decision.  If she declines, I'm comfortable going with John's offer."
