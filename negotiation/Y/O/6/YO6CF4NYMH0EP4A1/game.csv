"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,500,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, as it's still a valuable asset for my needs. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective. While I value finding a deal, the product's worth to me is considerably higher than your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This reflects the product's true value.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
