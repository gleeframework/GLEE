"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm initially offering it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have plenty of room to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

We are starting with a counter offer significantly lower than Alice's opening offer. This tactic: 

* **Signals our budget:**  It shows Alice we aren't easily swayed by her initial price.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  We expect Alice to counter, and this gives us space to gradually increase our offer.
* **Stays within a reasonable range:** While significantly lower, $85 is still a decent amount above Alice's value of $80, giving her an incentive to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to my initial price. How about we meet in the middle at $97? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but $97 is still too high. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about we settle at $90? That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** We're moving up from $85 to $90, demonstrating willingness to negotiate but not making a drastic jump.
* **Strategic positioning:** $90 is a strong position â€“ it's a $10 saving from Alice's last offer and still leaves room for a final compromise if needed. 
* **Maintaining politeness:** We're keeping the tone positive and collaborative to encourage Alice to continue the negotiation."
