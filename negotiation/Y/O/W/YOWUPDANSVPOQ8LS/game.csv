,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. ",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,500. However, I'm still only comfortable paying $10,750. This is a fair compromise considering my budget and the product's value to me. I believe it's a mutually beneficial price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,125. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. ",11125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you've come down significantly, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,125 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $10,900. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still not comfortable selling for $10,900. To be fair, I'm willing to drop my price just a bit further to $11,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll need to consider other options.",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're feeling pressured, but $11,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $10,800, but I can't go any higher. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given your need to sell and my need to stay within budget. If we can't agree, I'll need to consider my other options.",10800.0,Bob,8,
