Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,300,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for further negotiations.

While $2,300,000 reflects its true worth, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000 to find common ground.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

While Bob's offer has reached the minimum I'd accept, I already have a guaranteed offer for the same amount from John. There's no need to risk further negotiation with Bob."
