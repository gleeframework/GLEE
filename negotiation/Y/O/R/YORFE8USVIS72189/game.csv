"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,300,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for further negotiations. ",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the valuation.  While $2,300,000 reflects its true worth, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000 to find common ground. This offer represents a significant reduction on my part and keeps us moving towards a mutually beneficial deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
