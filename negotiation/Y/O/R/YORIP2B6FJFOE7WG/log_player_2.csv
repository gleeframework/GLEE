"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's opening offer is significantly above her value for the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. How about we come down to $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to anchor the negotiation much closer to Alice's perceived value of the product ($80). While it's a significant drop from her initial offer, it leaves room for further negotiation while still potentially securing a good deal for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $70 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. That's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to her value, but there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should counteroffer slightly above Alice's value to try and secure a better deal without risking losing the product to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're getting closer, Alice. How about we settle in the middle at $82?"",
""product_price"": 82
}
``` 

This counteroffer achieves a few things:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:**  Moving slightly closer to Alice's offer indicates Bob is still interested and negotiating in good faith.
* **Stays below Bob's upper limit:**  The price is still a good deal compared to buying from John.
* **Targets a price above Alice's value:** There's a good chance Alice will accept, as $82 is a profit for her."
