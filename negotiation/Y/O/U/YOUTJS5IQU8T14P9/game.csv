"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
