{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it."", ""product_price"": 115}

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. How about $105?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it is still below my minimum acceptable price. I will try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm confident you'll be happy with this product at that price."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $107.  Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not convinced he'll go any higher.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $120."
