"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my value for the product. However, $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $8500 for the product, which reflects its value to you and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $9500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9500 is still a bit high for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to go up to $8750. This is a fair compromise that allows us to both benefit from the deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $9250 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.
