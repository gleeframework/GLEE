"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $12000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $9,000 is still significantly higher than the product's worth to her ($8,000). Bob has 10 rounds and a fallback option with John for $12,000. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my value for the product. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product, which reflects its value to you and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  Bob's offer of $8,500 is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but still above the product's worth to Alice.  This shows good faith while also pushing for a better price.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes mutual benefit, acknowledging Alice's perspective while stating Bob's own limits. This sets a more collaborative tone for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $9500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Counter:** Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's offer, but $9,500 is still too high. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob has several rounds left and a fallback option with John, so there's still room to push for a lower price.
* **Strategy:**  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again keeps the negotiation moving towards Bob's desired price point."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair compromise that allows us to both benefit from the deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing willingness to compromise.  $8,750 is still significantly less than Alice's counteroffer, but it demonstrates a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Message:** The message continues to focus on mutual benefit and finding a solution that works for both parties. This helps maintain a positive and collaborative tone.
* **Strategic Move:** This counteroffer puts the ball back in Alice's court. It's a moderate increase that indicates Bob's seriousness while also leaving space for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering at $9250.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Counter:** Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's offer, but $9,250 is still too high.  
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Bob has several rounds left and a fallback option with John, so there's still room to push for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again keeps the negotiation moving toward Bob's desired price point.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $9,250 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.

Let's finalize this deal and get this product to its new home."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering at $9250.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice is stuck at $9,250 and hasn't budged.  
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 3 rounds left, the risk of running out of time is becoming more real.
* **Strategic Play:**  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again gives Bob a chance to push for his target price of $9,000.  If Alice doesn't budge, Bob can still go to John in the next round.
* **Evaluating Risk:**  While going to John is an option, Bob is still trying to get the best possible deal, and there's still a chance to convince Alice."

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your commitment to $9000, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'm counteroffering at $9100.
