"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $11,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,200? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in making a deal.",10200.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your continued interest in the product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this last offer.  How about we settle at $10,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally finalize this deal.  Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but no higher. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in making a deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one more time.",10000.0,Bob,6,
