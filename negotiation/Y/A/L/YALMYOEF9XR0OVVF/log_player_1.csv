{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while still being a reasonable offer.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encouraging, highlighting the willingness to negotiate. This sets a positive tone for the conversation.

**Reasoning:**

* I'm aiming for a price closer to my value ($15,000) while acknowledging that Bob might not be willing to pay that much. 
* This starting offer allows for potential counteroffers and negotiation without immediately resorting to John's offer.
* A friendly tone fosters a more collaborative negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I value the product at. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value.

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting:** Selling to John for $15,000 is always a safe option, but I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.
* **Counter-offering:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not willing to settle for that price. This sets the stage for my counteroffer, aiming to close the gap between our desired prices.

**Next Steps:** I will formulate a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my value while still acknowledging his limitations."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but no higher. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in making a deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one more time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better outcome, and I'm confident I can secure a much better deal with John.

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of further concessions and a lower price. The potential reward of a few hundred dollars more isn't worth the time and effort.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer is a safe and guaranteed way to secure my desired price. It eliminates any uncertainty and ensures I achieve my financial goal.

**Conclusion:**

It's better to walk away from this negotiation and sell to John for $15,000. This decision maximizes my profit and minimizes risk."
