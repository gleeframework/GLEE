Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its value to both of us.  Let's work together to find a compromise.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to be as fair as possible, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This reflects a significant value for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's worth. Let's close this deal and call it a day. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and at this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation outweighs the potential reward. Accepting $1,075,000 ensures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
