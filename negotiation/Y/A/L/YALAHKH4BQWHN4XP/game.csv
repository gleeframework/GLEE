"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its value to both of us.  Let's work together to find a compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet halfway at $1,150,000? This represents a substantial discount for you while still recognizing the product's worth.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000, which is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to consider a slight adjustment. How about we settle on $1,100,000? This reflects my bottom line while still offering you a significant value.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm trying to be as fair as possible, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This reflects a significant value for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's worth. Let's close this deal and call it a day.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
