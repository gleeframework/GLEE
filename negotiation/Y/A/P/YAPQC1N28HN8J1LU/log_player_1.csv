{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident a price of $1,400,000 is fair for both of us. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially quicker sale.
* **Understanding Value:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, and you value it at a minimum of $1,500,000.  The offer price of $1,400,000 leaves a significant margin for you while still being potentially attractive to Bob.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept the offer rather than risking losing the deal."
