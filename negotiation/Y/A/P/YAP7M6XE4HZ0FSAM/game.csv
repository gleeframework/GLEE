"Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than it is to me.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. This feels like a fair starting point given its potential worth to both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I'm not willing to pay top dollar at this point.",1075000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident that the true value of this product is much higher than your offer. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,110,000?",1110000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,075,000. How about we try to find a sweet spot between our two numbers? I'm willing to go up to $1,090,000.",1090000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,090,000 and $1,100,000, so how about $1,095,000?",1095000.0,Bob,6,
