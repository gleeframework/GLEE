Round 2
Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,075,000. How about we try to find a sweet spot between our two numbers? I'm willing to go up to $1,090,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**  We're still early in the negotiation. While Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, we have room to push for a better price. Rejecting this keeps the negotiation open and allows us to counter in Round 5."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counter-offer:

* **Shows flexibility:**  We're moving closer to Bob's price, demonstrating a willingness to make a deal.
* **Remains strong:** We're still holding firm above the $1,100,000 mark, aiming for a higher profit margin.
* **Encourages a response:** By making a smaller concession, we're prompting Bob to potentially make a more significant move towards our desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,090,000 and $1,100,000, so how about $1,095,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,095,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,095,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer of $1,095,000 still nets a significant profit of $95,000. 
* **Time Value:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation.  Dragging it out further increases the risk of Bob walking away or stalling until the very end.
* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:**  While we could try to squeeze out another $5,000, the risk of losing the deal and getting stuck with John's lower offer isn't worth it at this stage."
