# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $125. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's price is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $125, while John wants $150. 
* **You're still saving money:**  Even at $125, you're getting the product for less than your maximum budget of $150."
