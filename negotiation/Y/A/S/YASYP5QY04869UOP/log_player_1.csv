This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:** $950,000 is a significant profit margin above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation Trend:** Bob has been consistently increasing his offer, showing he's serious about buying.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations further might not yield much more, and you risk Bob losing interest or the market shifting."
