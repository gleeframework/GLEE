"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $9,500. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, Alice is asking for $9,500. This leaves little room for negotiation.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price. 
* **John is a backup:**  Even if the negotiation with Alice fails, Bob has the option to buy from John for $10,000, ensuring he gets the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500. This reflects the value I see in the product and gives you a fair price considering your cost."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I can't sell it for less than $9,000. This product is highly sought after, and I'm confident it will bring you significant value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:** While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay. 
* **More room for negotiation:** Bob can try to push for a lower price by making another counteroffer. 
* **John is a backup:**  If the negotiation with Alice fails, Bob can still buy the product from John for $10,000.

Bob is willing to take a small risk and continue negotiating, hoping to get a lower price."
