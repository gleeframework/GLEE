Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value to you might be around $100. To ensure we both benefit, I propose a price of $110 for the product. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle, ensuring you get a good deal while also maximizing my earnings. Please let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm happy to pay $105 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
