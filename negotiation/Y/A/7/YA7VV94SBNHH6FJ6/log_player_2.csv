"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value to you might be around $100. To ensure we both benefit, I propose a price of $110 for the product. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle, ensuring you get a good deal while also maximizing my earnings. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
