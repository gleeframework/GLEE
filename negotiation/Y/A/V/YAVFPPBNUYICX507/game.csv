"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $750,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still not quite there. Could you do $650,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $700,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $675,000? That's a fair middle ground between our last offers.",675000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $675,000. I'm willing to meet you at $680,000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to you.",680000.0,Alice,7,
