"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price just for you. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still higher than what the product is worth to you ($150). You want to save as much money as possible, so you'll reject her offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $140 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to do $130? "", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do $137, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think you'll really appreciate it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $137 is closer to your ideal price, but it's still above your limit. You're willing to negotiate further and try to reach a price that's closer to $130.  You still have plenty of rounds left to work with Alice and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $137 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $130. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $135. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is a good compromise. It's within your budget, and it's only $5 more than your ideal price.  While you could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might get frustrated and raise her price again, or even end the negotiations.  Accepting her offer is the best way to ensure you get the product for a price that is fair and affordable."
