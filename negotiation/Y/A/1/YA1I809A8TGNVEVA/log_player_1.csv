Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept less.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Unknown Information:** You don't know if Bob has other options or how eager he is to buy. 

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit but not so high that Bob walks away. A good strategy is to start closer to Bob's perceived value and leave room for negotiation.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message positions the offer as valuable and exclusive.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,400,000 is closer to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation but leaves you room to potentially negotiate down a bit if needed.
* **Confidence:** By leading with a strong offer and expressing your belief in its fairness, you set the tone for the negotiation.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower or risk losing the deal and selling to John."
