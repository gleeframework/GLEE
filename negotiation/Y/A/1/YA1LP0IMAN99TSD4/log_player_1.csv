"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point since it's below the product's value to Bob, but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}

I'm counteroffering at $130. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than his perceived value, and it's closer to my desired price point.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing than my previous offer and move us closer to a deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}

I'm counteroffering at $125.  This is a compromise - it's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. I believe this price is still attractive to Bob, while also getting me closer to my desired price.  I'm hopeful this will be the sweet spot to close the deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm counteroffering at $115. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's latest proposal. We're getting close to the end of our rounds and I need to be prepared to accept a slightly lower price if I want to avoid selling to John."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $105. While it's closer to my minimum price, I'm hoping to get just a little bit more. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, but I'm starting to feel the pressure to sell to John if I can't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only one round left, it's better for me to accept Bob's offer of $105. This is only $5 less than what John is offering, and I'm not sure if Bob will accept another counteroffer. I need to secure a sale before time runs out."
