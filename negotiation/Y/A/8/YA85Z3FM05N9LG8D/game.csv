"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $18,000?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $18,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $20,000?",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $20,000 is still a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us.  To be frank, $16,000 is cutting it quite close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $19,000, but that's my final offer.",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but $19,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $17,500?",17500.0,Bob,6,
