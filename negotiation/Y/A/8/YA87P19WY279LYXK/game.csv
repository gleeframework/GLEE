"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I'm happy to find a middle ground, $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about $8,500?  That's still a good price considering the product's value, and it's closer to your original offer. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer. However, $7,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to stay above $7,500.

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to stay above $7,500, but I'm still trying to get as close to my budget as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $7,750, which would be $7,625. Can you consider that?",7625.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,625 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $7,700.  Let's meet in the middle and go with $7,650.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the time we've invested in negotiating.  What do you think?",7650.0,Alice,7,
