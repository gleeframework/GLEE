"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I know you'll love!  I'm offering it to you at $9,000.  It's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above the product's worth to Bob ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to further justify my initial price. 

**Strategy:** 

I'm aiming to secure a price closer to $9,000, but I'm also prepared to negotiate down if necessary. I have the safety net of selling to John for $8,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $7,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's still interested. This gives me an opportunity to negotiate a higher price in the next round.
* **Safety Net:** I have the option of selling to John for $8,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired price point in the next round. I'll aim to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, but I won't compromise below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I'm happy to find a middle ground, $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about $8,500?  That's still a good price considering the product's value, and it's closer to your original offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** My counteroffer of $8,500 is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintain Flexibility:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation while still conveying my unwillingness to accept his initial offer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiation open and productive. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to secure a price closer to $8,500, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary. I'm using a combination of compromise and firmness to signal my willingness to reach a deal but not at a price that undervalues the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $7,500 is a bit low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,500, which would be $7,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $7,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm not yet willing to accept it. I'm concerned that accepting this offer might lead to a downward spiral in future negotiations, and I might end up with a price that is too low.
* **Safety Net:**  I have the option to sell to John for $8,000, which is a more favorable outcome than accepting Bob's current offer. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a slightly higher price in the next round. I'm aiming to secure a price that is closer to $8,000 while keeping the negotiation open. I'm also aware that time is running out, so I will need to make a decision soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer. However, $7,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to stay above $7,500.  Let's split the difference and go with $7,750.  This would be a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 7750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly Higher Counter:** My counteroffer of $7,750 is slightly higher than Bob's offer but still represents a compromise from my previous offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while maintaining my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my price point and encourage Bob to see the offer as fair.
* **Compromise Tone:** I'm using a neutral and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation open and positive. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to secure a price that is closer to my desired range. I'm aware that time is running out, so I'm making a smaller move in this round to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. I'm still prepared to sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiations fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to stay above $7,500, but I'm still trying to get as close to my budget as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $7,750, which would be $7,625. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $7,625 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only four rounds left, the pressure is on to secure a better price.  Accepting Bob's offer would likely lead to further downward negotiation in the remaining rounds, potentially resulting in a price that is too low.
* **John is a Reliable Option:** Selling to John for $8,000 is still a viable option, providing a guaranteed minimum profit.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a slightly higher price in the next round.  I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my desired range, but I'm also prepared to accept John's offer if the negotiations don't improve significantly. The risk of accepting a lower price at this stage outweighs the potential for a better offer in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,625 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $7,700.  Let's meet in the middle and go with $7,650.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the time we've invested in negotiating.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7650}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a smaller compromise, moving up from $7,625 to $7,650. This shows I'm willing to be flexible but not concede too much. 
* **Focus on Time and Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that we've been negotiating for a while, and the price reflects the product's worth.
* **Maintain Positive Tone:** I'm keeping a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation open. 

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping to close the deal with a price that is close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm aware that time is running out and that John is a viable alternative.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go below $7,650."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down a bit further, but I'm still trying to get as close to my budget as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $7,650, which would be $7,575. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,575. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,575
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, the risk of accepting a low price is high. There's a good chance that further negotiation will result in a price even lower than $7,575.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** Selling to John for $8,000 guarantees my minimum acceptable price and removes the uncertainty of further negotiation. 
* **No Guarantee of Improvement:** There's no guarantee that Bob will accept my counteroffer in the next round, and we might end up with no deal at all.

**Strategy:**

Selling to John now is the most logical choice. It ensures a profit and avoids the risk of further downward negotiation. It's better to secure a known value than risk ending up with a lower price or no deal at all."
