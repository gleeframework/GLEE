"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it will be just as valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for a price that will be mutually beneficial. Let's discuss a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly stating the product's value to her ($1,000,000) and implying it holds the same value for you. Her opening statement suggests she's aiming for a ""mutually beneficial"" deal, which means she's likely open to negotiation. Since you have John as a backup option at $1,000,000, there's no harm in rejecting Alice's initial offer and seeing if she'll come down to a more favorable price."
