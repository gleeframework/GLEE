"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it right now.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $12000. This is a great deal considering the value the product can bring to your business. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $9000, but I'm not sure I can go higher than that.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $9000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Let's split the difference and go with $9750.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $10750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,7,
