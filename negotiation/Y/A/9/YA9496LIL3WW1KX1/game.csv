"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for a price that's significantly below its true market value. While I can't disclose the exact value to me, I assure you it's no less than $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to let you have it for $1,350,000. This is a price point that allows you to maximize your profit while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1350000.0,Alice,1,
