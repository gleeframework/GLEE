Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is simply too low for me. The value of this product is much higher. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would be a great deal for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $725,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  Let's try $875,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you've stated, and it gives us both some room to be happy with the outcome.

Alice is unlikely to come down much further and is trying to get a price closer to $900,000.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $800,000."
