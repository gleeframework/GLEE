"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a decent offer, Bob can potentially do better.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to drop her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to spend a bit less. How about $850,000?  This would leave both of us with a good profit margin."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to find a good deal.  While $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $900,000? This reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant return. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $900,000 is still above Bob's target.  There's room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if Alice will budge further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you at $875,000.  This seems like a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 875000}
